I have a very simple task; just select a point on a trail, then another point on the same trail, and use the trail as a route.  DeLorme let me do it, once.  Every other time I've tried, it just connects the two points with a straight line on the 2-D map and won't let me change it.  It does still allow me to delete the route, but that isn't much help.There are at least three different ways of creating a route using an existing trail, but all of them do the same thing; a straight line from endpoint to endpoint.  If I add points in between, it just connects them with straight line segments.  Theoretically, I suppose I could enter a large number of points in between and get something that resembles the actual trail length.Sometimes, as if to taunt me, it highlights the trail that I'm trying to get it to use as a route, but won't keep it as the route.  The tutorials and help pages all say that what I'm doing will use the trail as my route.  The software denies that claim.I've gone to the technical support website repeatedly, and the one concrete thing that I've learned is that I might as well watch television instead; it's just as useful and less irritating.  Technical support is a series of articles none of which have anything to do with the topic that I've searched.  If it has the phrase I've entered, it presents the article.  It even ignores anything that I've entered regarding which product I'm actually trying to get information on, and just lists every article, regardless of what product the article is referring to.
