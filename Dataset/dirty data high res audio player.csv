find a way to get my mp3s into my high five systems I've tried to so in US but that hadn't really worked out for me because in like the way that it controlled I prefer something with more physical controls actual buttons I compress that I can keep in the hi-fi rack that I've got I listed out my requirements and I bought something that I thought would suit me but unfortunately it didn't work out so in the end I sent it back and I replaced it with something that costs more than twice as much it's pretty expensive this it's these Sony H a ps1 you can see the prices at the bottom of the screen there although to be honest I don't feel ripped off I actually do like this device let me show it to you inside the box we've got this card that says we've got a little stick inside the box as well a memory stick which has got some high res audio files on it we've also got a Quick Start Guide got a few more things there you can see the memory stick in there as well as the batteries for the remote control power lead and an Ethernet cable but this will connect over Ethernet or Wi-Fi but it's got an Ethernet cable in the box just to help you out and we've got a little simple remote control here as well now the device itself is very heavy it's very well made it feels like a brick I mean it's a good quality piece of kit but it should be for the price this is actually a proper system you can see there we've got HDD 500 gig hard drive in it and it's got 40 watts amps as well on there it's supposed to be an all-in-one system you can see the bottom note says audio player system you could just have this on its own connect it up to some speakers and use it as it is however I'm actually connecting it into an existing high five some bypassing all that you can use it as a digital analog converter as well out sir USB plugs you can put extra storage on there to expand the Foundry gigs out got Ethernet we've got coax in optical in but I'm just using the out on this one we've got two another two ins at the bottom there as well and logins oh and also connecting up this Ethernet cable so I'll just spin it around put it in mice so as you can see that it fits like a glove it looks really nice it fits in with all the other stuff I've got the remote perhaps not so nice made out a plastic with rubber buttons on it but it's got the controls on there that you want and no more there's a little memory stick there I have to put that in the back up that USB stick it goes in the back there with those extra high-res tracks on it so you can try those out straight away without having to put any of your own music on there so I'll connect it up turn it on and as you can see there it comes on it's got a little bit of a boot up top it's got a fan in here that you can't hear but it does have a fan in the back it's very silent menus lot nicer on this one than the previous thing choose your language easy on-screen explanation as to what's going on you can have it sort of working standby so it can pick up music off your network while it's in standby and you can choose wired or wireless setup and unlike the previous device no necessity to reboot when you're switching between those however one thing you've got to watch out for it's trying to format that little USB stick that I put in the back so you get a select notes that otherwise you lose the things that are on it which are those HD tracks as well as the software for windows right selecting my wireless network here and then I'm just going to put my password and using this on-screen keyboard as you can see it's like a jog shuttle wheel out that you can spin then click into select things right so everything's okay there so we'll click OK and close and look we've got a firmware update this was a firmware update with everything nowadays in there so let's install that first of all and while that's going on let's just have a look at the piece of software that we're going to have to use to transfer these files across I use a Mac and it says that the Mac software has to be downloaded separately however the address it gave there was nothing there so but I did manage to find it on the Sony website so click to download and again for all not found so I've got a bit worried at this point I'm thinking I'm not going to better transfer the files across to that hard drive however I did find the software in the European store downloaded that installed it and then what happens is it finds the device on your network you choose what folders you want to copy across to that internal hard drive on the device and what files you want to copy across what types of files now once you've done that you can start it off going it does take a long time look at the top right there counting up I say counting up nothing's happening yet but just look how slowly does care when it starts counting one out of all those tracks that's all about tracks are going to be copied across in fact to copy all my music collection across to this device so can entire weekend you can see there at the top of the screen it's counting up from 103 104 this is over an Ethernet cable which is slightly faster on this slightly than Wi-Fi but remember you don't have to do this once the first time you get it that's it after that after about you just uploading the old track or add an album every now and then it goes into some sort of standby mode so it's not using all your power while it's doing this anyway when it's got all the music on I'll show you how it works on the right here we've got this control that's that wheel that we can spin around we got a play/pause kind of back and we got a home button those are the buttons I'm using those ones in the middle this one on the right this big volume button it's kind of dampened it's got a good feel to it I'm not going to use that because I'm not using the inbuilt amp I'm using a different amp with this so I'm just using there out on the Left we've got a power button and headphone socket and a nice be clear screen and of course we can control it all with that remote and use it that way or we can use these buttons on the screens I'm going to show you how it works and see here we can spin down we got this nice little on-screen graphics changing as we go into the different menus it's got great aesthetics this thing it looks really nice it's a beautiful piece of kit so let's go into one of these things here you see at the bottom in external input that's if you're using as a hi-fi device on its own you can use those lines in our optical lens and it'll work as a really good digital analog converter now go into the internet radio which is something I've never really paid attention to before I've had internet radios and never really liked them however this one it's so easy to use I've actually started using internet radio you can pick your genres and things I'll just go into the old stations here look how many stations there are to choose from I mean it's ridiculous you could never listen to all of these so hopefully you managed to find a couple of radio stations you want there's a few different ways of doing that you can go by genre or even bitrate and things like that and then put them in your favorite stations folder here so you've got easy access to them in the future so I'll put a few in there now I'll just click on one of those you can see it loads up starts playing straight away and you get some really pretty decent quality you can see the kilobits a second at the bottom there actually sounds pretty good but of course I didn't buy this device to be an internet radio I wanted it so I could play back all my music collection conveniently and easily so let's have a look how good it is at doing that I can pick John Roos artists albums or tracks if we go into albums you can see at the top of the screen I've got 915 albums in here if I click on that you'll see 18,000 tracks there's a lot of very large compilations in amongst those you can scroll through these really easily there's a sort of clicky feel to that knob there so you can just stop it exactly where you want let's try playing back talking all that jazz by steps of sodding which is on there in full gear album so I'll just look for that now in full gear spin down track 13 talking all that jazz and there we go playing straight away the good thing about having it on an internal hard drive everything is quick notice we've got 320 kilobits a second on that one there I'll show you some high res audio that are downloaded I got some from HD tracks calm we can download albums these higher res so we'll go and pick one of these what what did I get now it was Physical Graffiti that's it so let's have a look here play track WOD you can see there that's a flack file which is a presumably it's supposed to sound better which it does I mean he'll so great everything sounds great now let me show you how these buttons work to move tracks you can just spin that little knob a little bit just slightly it'll move to the next track it's like a skip forward I cos you can skip back if you want if you want to pick a particular track once your album spin it a bit and you can see all the tracks off the album later influence you so you can jump down to any particular track you on a plate in addition to that when you're playing it you can just click it in and you've got the option to shuffle all the tracks or all the album's if you want repeat them and you can add favorites where you can put a little heart next to something that shows up in another folder where all your favorite music collects this dsee thing is this is supposed to make rubbishy sounding mp3 sound better by adding in extra detail it does actually sound better if you've got a low kill a bitrate mp3 and we can also adjust the treble and bass here I think that only really works though if you've got it going back through its own speakers not through another device like I have you can delete tracks of course as well now this sends me thing I'll show you what that is let's just jump outta here and I could have just press home by the way rather than pressing that a few times so sends me channels or things where you can choose a kind of mood I suppose that you want so let's see we got morning daytime evening night etc you can see how many tracks are in each one of those it's figure this out itself which probably not always getting it right but if you click on one of those things let's go for Midnight's it'll play something back that it's things you might want to hear at midnight I suppose a good maybe for parties things like that stick it in a certain mode just have it play tunes in the background I suppose it's quite a nice little feature although to be honest I prefer to pick the record that I want to listen to but if you just want to have a random record playing it's a pretty good option now you can also use an app with this of course I won't be doing this I'm not interested in using an app but the app does give you extra features as well you can rename tracks and move them about change the genres and things change the settings but as you can see here it works really well as well if you were into apps and it enables you to get into the settings and all the other options that you've seen so far but for me this device is really all about the fact that I can now access every single CD that I've ever bought within just a couple of seconds you can see I can scroll through my entire collection they're not all mine by the way there's quite a few of the Misses ones in there all the bad ones are hers all the interesting and cool stuff that's mine but you can see I can just pick a record here very easily just click on that and pick one of Stevie Wonder's classics there we go that'll do living for the city just one of 18,000 tracks I can pick with a quick spin of a wheel now YouTube comments have tended to go ballistic whenever I've spent a large amount of money on anything but don't worry you don't have to buy one of these I bought it with my money and I'm very happy in fact it's one of my favourite things anyway that's it for the moment as always thanks for watching"
1,GbGDPFVjvVU,Techmoan,UC5I2hjZYiW9gZPVkvzM8_Cw,MQS SD - The Newest Physical Retail Music Format,"A look at a Hi-Res pre-recorded physical music format,  MQS SD.
There is some important info in this video description text box... 

MQS SD is sold in South Korea & HK for use with the Astell & Kern Hi-Res Personal Audio Players which feature MicroSD card storage slots. 

Astell & Kern use MQS to define HD Audio in a FLAC format with a 24bit encoding. According to their specs the KHz sample rate can vary depending on the source between 48KHz and 192KHz. The Beatles LP seems to be a special case because it’s just 44.1 KHz and I suspect this is because that’s the best source currently available. 

Back in 2014 manufacturers and record companies got together to define a system to code HD audio files. Here’s what they came up with. 

MQ-A - Taken from an Analogue Master Source
MQ-C - Sourced from a 16bit 44.1KHz CD master and upsampled
MQ-D - Sourced directly from a Direct Stream Digital DSD Master
MQ-P - Sourced from a minimum 20bit master with a minimum 48KHz sample rate

I haven’t seen these in use anywhere since, perhaps the descriptions were considered too verbose when you then combine them with the filetype AIFF, ALAC, FLAC or WAV. 

So what is MQS? Well as the video shows it’s not exactly nailed down in A&K’s description and I suspect that it’s just a simplification of the existing system. 

If you look at this South Korean music download site http://www.groovers.kr/mqs/chart/domestic?d=-1091701920 you can see they use MQS to identify HD tracks and then use a code like MQS 24/192 to identify the quality. The logo stands out in red on the page and the system is slightly simpler than stating a file is “HD Audio MQ-D FLAC 24/192”

Whether the average human ear is capable of hearing the difference between all these things -  I haven't a clue and I don't have a horse in that race...I'm just interested in collecting formats. 

I'm particularly interested in physical packed pre-recorded music...music in a box sold as a retail product. This is the most recent packaged music format (as far as I know). Yes SD cards and FLAC are not new...but putting them together in a nice box with cover-art and a booklet is...and that's what this video is about...something you probably weren't aware existed.

SNAKEOIL - It's a flippant joke at the vague definition of the benefits of MQS over normal FLAC HiRes audio files...is there really any difference? It appears MQS is just 24 bit FLAC. 
I AM NOT SAYING HI-RES AUDIO IS SNAKEOIL ...just that I can see no discernible technical differences between 24 bit FLAC and MQS. Perhaps there is one...and if so A&K need to do a better job of defining exactly what the specific benefits of MQS difference are.  

Here is a link to all the MQS SD Card Albums. 
http://mall.groovers.kr/front/productlist.php?code=001000000000&listnum=12&sort=&block=0&gotopage=1

I bought my Beatles MQS SD Album on ebay - here's a link that should find any for sale https://goo.gl/MMOKDM
Don't overpay though! 

Incidentally there's also another file format called MQA - here's some info on that http://www.soundandvision.com/content/hi-res-label-unamas-release-10-mqa-recordings This seems to have no connection to the MQ-A categorisation I mentioned above (which describes the origin of a recording -  like AAD or DDD you used to see on CD's) This MQA (without the dash) actually seems to be a separate format that is backwardly compatible with some other formats...it's all very confusing. 

UPDATE 
No one has to buy these. Your existing choice of music delivery medium will continue to function irrespective of the success or failure of MQS SD. I didn't anticipate that showing an obscure music delivery format that is only marketed in South Korea for playback of audio via the micro SD card slot on a high-end digital media player would be so controversial.

them now the most recent format that came out that had mass market success will have been the compact disc since the CD there been other formats that have been introduced but they've generally been met with public apathy we've had things like the digital audio tape the mini disc digital compact cassette si CD DVD audio and blu-ray audio now while it was clear from the off the blu-ray audio was never going to be a mass-market success I am fond of the format more often than not the titles were released on it would have been multiple disc compilations on other formats but could all fit on one blu-ray disc of course you could play it on any blu-ray player the audio was high-res and this one that I got this Rolling Stones compilation has 50 tracks on it and actually cost less at the time I bought it than the CD compilation and also comes with a download code for 320 kilobits per second mp3 files and of course you get a larger buckler in this and you will get inside the CD but despite all I'm sure there are plenty people watching this who've never heard of blu-ray audio and unfortunately I think by now it's largely fizzled out as a format but for a while that was the last pre-recorded audio format that have been released but now there's a new one let me show it to you and here it is that you'd be forgiven for thinking that this is a CD well the box is the same size and shape as a CD case of course this is the Beatles one compilation it's got the same track listing on here you get if you were to buy this on a CD this format is known as mqs well at least it's kind of known as that's a little bit complicated there's only been perhaps half a dozen titles released on it so far a bug those titles were a Pavarotti compilation and album by Jason Mraz and another one by Bon Jovi but this is the only one I was interested in and as you can see this is imported it comes from South Korea and the format we're talking about is in the end here and if I get that out you can see straight away it is a microSD card I was happy to see that they've put the album bar on the actual microSD card itself and that's not a sticker that's actually printed on the surface you get a booklet inside the box as well which I'd imagine you also get if you were to buy this on CD although I don't own this compilation on CD it's also stuck in the back of there you can remove that but anyway who is or what is mqs well it comes from a company called Astle and kern they're a South Korean manufacturer of high-end personal audio players that play high-res files and their description of mqs is as follows NQ s or mastering quality ser refers to a high definition 24-bit 48 to 192 kilohertz sound generated with the mqs technique which processes the original sound file during a mastering stage the final stage of sound-making mqs delivers a full-bodied sound close to the original sound source provided with more than six point five times amount of data that CD sound has mqs lets you experience an incomparable and ultimate sound performance or to sum up each snake-oil anyway I'll put it inside the computer here we put the microSD card in this SD card reader and pop it into the computer we'll just have a look at the files are on here to see exactly what you get well it's just a normal micro SD card formatted as fat32 the audio files on this album take up 897 megabytes of storage and they're all FLAC files if we inspect one of those files we can see that for this one they've been recorded 44 point 1 kilohertz at 24 bits now 44.1 is exactly the same as a compact disc but a compact disc is 44 per one and 16 bits this one is 24 bits which means it's a little bit better quality and those specs match the Beatles USB stick that came out a few years ago that had all their albums on it also at 44 point 1 kilohertz up 24 bits I think that's the highest quality that the Beatles albums have ever been released in and of course with these being standard FLAC files it means you can play them back on any piece of hardware or software that supports that format which answers a question are how did biomart I didn't know whether mqs was actually a format or just specific to a still in Kern but though it's flat files but at 24 bits I'm sure there are some people out there that are experiencing deja vu at the moment and don't worry not going mad somebody has tried this idea before some disk introduced the slot music format a number of years ago where they released pre-recorded albums on one gigabyte microSD cards those microSD cards contain 320 kilobits per second mp3 files and of course you'll put those micro SD cards and compatible mp3 players or mobile phones the microSD cards themselves came in these nice little plastic boxes that had albemarle on them although the micro sd card itself didn't have any art on there and you also got a little USB SD card reader I suppose then that raises a question of why try and reintroduce the idea of selling pre-recorded music on a delivery format that's previously failed as a way to sell pre-recorded music well I suppose things are a little bit different there in that we're dealing with high res or HD audio files but it's probably quite a bit easier just to go on a website like HD tracks and download the files from there although a quick check reveals they don't currently have the Beatles albums available to download of course a stolen Kern who are behind this format do sell the personal audio players that have microSD card slots on them so I suppose they're thinking customers could just pick these up and slot them in and they don't have to mess around with a computer and after all who's it really harming this is only a very nice thing that's only available in South Korea I don't think any probably people buy their music on microSD cards if that's what they want to do and I think this Beatles compilation is probably going to end up being pretty collectible in years to come so they have it as far as I'm aware the mqs micro sd card is the last pre recorded music format that's been introduced unless of course you know different and if you do please put some information in the comments anyway that's it for the bowl burn as always thanks for watching

Track Name: Busted by John Deley 

If you want to hear the effects of the up-conversion of a cassette yourself - you can download the audio here: https://bit.ly/2KB6PVn

To make these files, first two identical recordings of the track 'Busted' were made onto one tape in one continuous go (the track was on repeat) from a Sony HAP-S1 digital audio player onto a Sony TC-K333ESJ which contained new-old-stock TDK SA90 tape. This tape was then played back on the Toshiba TY-AK1 - the first track with the Up-convert option off and the second with it switched on. The recordings were done from the headphone output into a PCM recorder (WAV format). These recordings are unedited.

of March Toshiba held a press conference to announce they were going to release a high-res cassette player in Japan this announcement caused equal amounts of interest confusion and amusement reading into it a little bit further it appears the device has a button on it that when pressed promises to make plain old cassette sound as good as high res audio so the big question is does it work well let's find out now whilst I've imported my machine from Japan it is currently only supposed to be sold within the domestic market it's not really for export but if you're interested the model number is tya k-1 and as well as being able to play cassettes it's also got a compact disc player and it can play files off SD cards or USB sticks those files can be mp3s flax or WAV and it's also got an AM and FM radio now although I will try out those high res digital formats the real reason I bought this is because I'm intrigued as to how good a cassette player it is and whether or not this up conversion of cassettes really does make a difference so let's get it out of the box and take a good look at it now of course it's got a Japanese instruction booklet but any parts I'm slightly confused about it I'll just translate using the Google Translate app now it does feel a lot more lightweight and less substantial than I was hoping for very plasticky on the front we've got the cassette on the top is the CD player at the bottom right we've got the USB socket and the SD card reader across the top we've got a vu meter and there's two ways speakers there you can see the tweeters in the corner around the back we've got ports for those as well but there's no battery compartment on here this thing doesn't run on batteries you have to run it from a wall power supply and being Japanese it runs on a hundred volts it comes with an infrared remote control and notice next to my finger there is the all-important upconvert button that when pressed should make sources that aren't high-res sound high-res or at least that's the theory there's also one of those upconvert buttons on the front of the machine and next to that are three record buttons you've got the option to either record to SD cards or USB sticks and that will record as a 192 kilobits per second mp3 file or you can record onto the tape on the front left of the machine next to the power button are the buttons to choose between the various audio sources you've got a choice of CD am/fm radio tape SD card USB or line input the input is on the front of the machine it's a three and a half millimeter mini jacket is next to the headphone output and the microphone input and to the right of there is a switch to choose between normal and high position tapes more buttons again on the top of the machine on the left hand side it's the transport controls as a whole to alter middle it's the controls for the clock and timer and then over on the right hand side we've got the choices for the radio presets as well as the tuning and the volume controls now because it runs on a hundred volts and coming out to my wall somewhere around about 230 volts I'm using it with a step-down power transformer of course you don't have to use it with one that's this beef is just the one I've going here at the moment now switching it on you can see the display comes on on the front it lights up and it's looking for a CD it can't find it but notice it's got Japanese text on there to tell you that but when you switch it to tape it says no tape strangely enough so a little bit mixed up there you can't change the language in this it just is what it is I haven't changing the date and time on here though although I believe if you're in Japan I think it pulls that through from the radio now talking of the radio it's not a very good shooter on this one I've noticed even with the Ariel fully extended I struggle to get things tuned in now it is using the full frequency range Japanese radios used to just use the bottom bit but a few years ago they extended it to the full range so it's the same frequencies as I get any normal radio in this country except it just doesn't really seem to pull in a very strong signal at all so not a very good radio but we're not here to look at the radio we're here to look at the cassette player so let's do that now coincidentally at the same time the cassette player arrived this tape turned up in the post as well this is retro grooves - from Anders anchor Jensen I'll be able to play this without hitting a youtube copyright match I'll put a link to his website in the video description text box but let's just take a listen [Music] [Applause] [Music] well that was underwhelming the upconversion didn't seem to make any difference at all to me there but let's have a look at this cassette mechanism to see how good it is and it isn't good it's very low-end but I can't really say low-end I suppose because it's just the end because these are the last types of cassette mechanisms that are made don't force you all the good ones they stop making those many years ago this is it this is the standard now and it's not very good if we look at my proper machine that I've got here it's got a three head closed loop dual capstan quartz lock direct drive with Dolby s all of those are not features on this machine it's just a very basic unimpressive cassette mechanism now looking inside here there's the usual sensors that detect what's going on with the tape for example this one on the left detects whether or not you've pulled the right protect notch out of it this one in the middle is the one that detects whether or not using metal tapes because of course metal tapes of those two extra holes in the middle now the reason it's detecting them isn't because it can play them it's so it can't play them it says there's no tape in there when you put a metal tape in this machine because the machine is only designed to play either type 1 or type 2 tapes and it can only play type 2 you're not recording on those you've got to select to switch to the bottom but if you want to record you're only supposed to record on type 1 tapes they're just moving away from cassette briefly for a moment I want to have a look at this high res audio business up put some files on this USB stick on here I've got a mp3 as well as FLAC WAV and AIFF now it's quite happy playing the flacc and the wave it completely ignored there AIFF pretended it wasn't there and the mp3 played fine and that was at 320 kilobits a second initially I thought it wasn't capable of displaying the file names until I discovered that there were additional buttons on the remote control and there's a display button here that when pressed will change the display to show the file names but to say that display really does seem very old and speery it's not very pleasant to look at brand-new device it looks like something that came out 20 years ago it's also got a really narrow viewing angle you pretty much have to be looking at it dead-on straight to be able to read the text and I should also mention these recording functions in here to record you just hold down one of those for a couple of seconds so for example you could record a CD onto a tape or you could record a tape to the USB stick which is exactly what I'm doing now and if you look on the USB stick you find that you get a separate record folder it's labeled rec presumably in reference to the Spanish horror film and the files it records are 192 kilobits a second mp3s another function that just has a button on the remote but not on the machine itself is EQ apparently this button if you hold it down will activate a mic echo but if you just press it it switches the sound quality not very specific there I think it's perhaps supposed to be a little bit like if you were to mess around with the settings on your graphic equalizer but of course it's just got the one setting and if you activate the EQ well I couldn't really tell any difference ago and it seemed the same to me as before and you can even combine the EQ with the upconvert if you want to but again I'm just not getting it I just really I'm not seeing your I should say not hearing what's there I even tried it over my headphones I sort of closing my eyes and everything it's just not really making any difference at all as far as I can make out but what exactly is this upconvert business supposed to be doing even if I'm unable to hear it well according to the Toshiba website it does this and as far as I can make out that is a very similar function to the one in my Sony H a ps1 digital music player which has a function called dsee HX and dsee and if you switch those on there supposed to replace something that's been lost from the original audio I don't exactly know quite what's going on but all that when I switch it on it does sound a little bit better so I'll just leave it switched on so I'd like to give that function another go on this machine this time I'm going to try on a CD this is from candy apple blue there's a link to them in the video description text box first off I'll just play the C normally and then I'll go back and play the same section with the upconversion switched on [Music] well I've been through too many nights with you to give you up without a fight right let's listen again but this time with the up conversion activated [Music] well I've been through too many nights with you to give you up without a fight now there's an obvious flaw in that video demonstration it's the fact that I recorded the CD by the headphone output on the Toshiba player as a PCM file then imported that into my editing package while I put this whole video together at which point I outputs the video and it comes out with an AAC audio track I then upload that to YouTube and you then listen to a stream version of that well it has an even lower quality than the version that I uploaded so it's never going to sound even as good as the original CD so trying to determine the difference between a CD and an upscale version of the CD is going to be impossible via YouTube however I got to say personally here and listening to it could not tell any difference at all either over the speakers or via the headphone output so just to double-check that that up convert button was doing something I imported audio of a cassette being played in the machine with the standard version and with the up convert button pressed in into audacity and then I compared the waveforms between the two versions and there is a very slight difference so pressing that button is doing something although whether it's something you'd be able to hear I very much doubt looking at the very slight difference between the two but what I'll do I'll put both versions available for you to download and you can have a listen for yourself and see if you can spot the difference now being for the Japanese market we've got a microphone input on here so we can sing along with CDs and it's got the appropriate vocal down button which should mute the vocal so you can sing over the top of the backing track although it doesn't work very well just have a listen to this [Music] now going back to cassettes there's one feature that I thought was on this machine that either doesn't work or it doesn't have and it's the ability to skip to the next track order tape now this is a feature that I've got on this machine the idea is you press the button rather than the fast-forward button and it skips on once it finds a blank section of tape between two tracks it then rewinds a little bit and you can get to the next track I thought this machine had that function because when you press the button you get the indicator on-screen which says it's going to the next track that's the standard icon for that but it doesn't go to the next track it just goes all the way to the end of the tape and doesn't stop it doesn't matter how long a gap there is between tracks either so it just seems like it doesn't have that feature even though it looks like it does now I'm going to be doing something a little bit different here normally when I review audio equipment I just sort of say well he sounds ok to me or it doesn't sound good at all that's about the limit of my scientific tests well this time I'm going to be doing something a little bit more scientific I'm going to record some audio onto this type wante because that's the only type of tape that this machine is supposed to be able to record on and on there I'm gonna put a sine wave that I'm recording off the USB stick as well as some pink noise now I've also recorded those same things with my main Sony machine onto some chrome tape which it can play and I'll put that in here as well and I'm going to record both of those being played back into this PCM recorder and I'm sending them off to someone I know that chap is Hugo he runs the Walkman archive as well as stereo to go and the reason I've enlisted his help is because he's a bit of an expert at looking at audio files and I'm really down into the detail of how different tapes for example perform in comparison to each other he's got all the equipment for this so I've sent him off these files and he sent me about the results so let's take a look at them right so first Wow and flutter or speed irregularities that kind of wobbly sound that you'd notice if it gets too high well on my Sony where the tape is recorded itself and being played back from the Sony it's come roundabouts naught point naught six or something not brilliant but you know pretty good you wouldn't notice that at all whereas on the Toshiba where the tape that it's recorded and played back we coming in at naught point one ish or just over maybe don't point to at times it's not looking good anyway you definitely notice that so wobbly kind of sound going onto frequency response well this line ideally is supposed to be completely flat all the way across showing that it's got a full frequency response from the low end up to the high end my Sony's dropping off a little bit on the left but again is a pretty good result overall now if we have a look at a p-- that's been recorded in the toshiba and playback through the table you can see it's going up and down like a mountain and it drops off on the left hand side it drops off on the right on side and it's a bit wobbly in the middle so really we're only get in the middle of the frequency range if we listen to the tape that i recorded on the sony being played back on the toshiba it does improve it a little bit we shows that recording a better quality sound plays back a little bit better but it's still a bit of a mountain in the middle there not good at all now if we just have a look at the tape that i've recorded with the upconversion switched on well that barely makes any difference at all it kind of varies the shape a little bit but really there's no extra frequencies represented in the audio and then going back to the sony one finally just to show you what he should really have looked like so overall then those results just show that it's not a good cassette player in fact any decent deck from the seventies eighties or nineties would sound better than this so then that got us thinking for a bit of fun why not put it head-to-head against what is quite probably the best home cassette recorder ever made [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes it's the legendary nakanishi dragon and the one that Hugo Scott has even been modified so it's even better than the factory spec what we're going to do we're not going to record busted it's a track from the YouTube audio library he's going to record it on his TDK si X I'm gonna record it on a TDK si 90 he'll be recording it in his nakanishi dragon and playing it back from there I'm recording it in the sony k triple 3 and playing it back from the toshiba machine now neither of us can use Dolby noise reduction because the Toshiba machine is incapable of decoding it so these are just type 2 tapes being played back on two different machines so let's do a bit of a comparison [Music] it's hard to know how well that's going to come across on YouTube after all we start off with a 320 kilobits a second mp3 file we then convert that onto analog tapes and then put it back into the digital domain again so hopefully the differences are still apparent by the time you listen to it at the other end what problem I had putting that bit together that I didn't anticipate was the fact that our shiba machine was running just a little bit too quickly so by the time the track reached their end the machines were out of sync with one another just have a listen to this [Music] now I've got to stress putting this machine up against the Nakamichi dragon was really just a bit of fun it was nothing to be taken too seriously after all the machine is in a completely different price range in Japan it's twenty-one thousand two hundred and ninety nine yen which currently equates to about a hundred and forty two UK pounds or a hundred ninety four US dollars but if you decide to import one you'll pretty much double those prices so in summing up I'm a little bit annoyed by this device though it's not expensive over in Japan but despite that fact it doesn't really do what it sets out to do for example they call it a high res audio device and while it can play lossless FLAC files I challenge anyone to be able to spot the difference between those and 192 kilobits a second mp3 when they're being played back through this and I haven't yet mentioned those speakers they sound like they look they're small plastic speakers they aren't terrible but they don't impress in any way and I can see why they limited the volume to such low levels as this case has a tendency to rattle and resonate when reproducing certain bass notes the overall construction is about as plastic as it can get and the only bits of metal are the speaker grilles and their aerial it's not the good kind of plastic either the finish is about as low end as it goes I mean I nearly cut my finger on the sharp edge of the cassette door and you can see on the CD lid at the back where it's been taken off the mold and I really don't understand why they'd make a portable machine but they're not give it the ability to run off battery power and I've seen better LCDs on a tamagotchi and while I do like a vu meter the one on here is just for show because the machine doesn't have manual recording level controls and finally that big headline feature the upconversion could you hear any difference if so you're doing better than I am so it's another sad day for cassettes a former that still has the ability to sound amazing but it's just not going to do it on a machine like this so my apologies for ending on such a down note but I've done what I set out to do at the beginning that was to find out whether the Toshiba T Y ek1 sounded any good and the answer is no so that's it for the Bourbon has always thanks for watching [Music] you so what's all this I'll keep hearing about hires music hires music yeah it's written on the gold sticker on the hi-fi's in the window of Lasky's hall you mean high-res doer yes luckily for you I know all about high res music so that's me anything right what does it mean I don't remember music having any kind of res before well high res means that it's got more res much more than low res music which means it sounds better higher things are always best like cholesterol so a CDS clusters high res there are CDs get with the times old man but I upgraded my record collection to CDs because they were supposed to sound better ah but then you ripped those CDs to mp3s and mp3 sound rubbish so I'll just go back and play my old CDs no they're not high res they're all 16-bit it's like listening to pixel art how many Bitsy's i rez then all of them at least a million well and what hi-res music can you buy well it's mostly stuff that they recorded on to tape in the 60s and 70s why is that well the 80 stuff was digitally mastered so it could only ever sound as good as a CD you seem strangely knowledgeable about this subject I read an article but still it's out of character it's like you've got an agenda look just go with it oh okay then what about new music there's that being recorded in high rest then do they even make new music I don't know I haven't seen Top of the Pops for years I think it got replaced by minecraft alright so if I want to get into high res what do I have to buy well you need to buy a new amplifier and speakers is and your leader source like barbecue your room will need to be acoustically perfect and you'll need to connect it all up with diamond coated cables that have been kissed by the Pope this sounds expensive ironically it is well is that ironic because the kind of people who can afford it ah your age but they come here how I rest what exactly old people ears can't hear all the frequencies so you might as well be listening to an eight truck flippin Eck what do you be able to hear it properly probably but I'm not going to spend a fortune just to listen to some stuffy old music that's recorded by hippies right so let me get this straight I could afford it but I can't hear it you can't afford it but you could hear it but you're not interested yeah that pretty much sums it up it sounds like it's gonna sell like hotcakes

Listening to Hi-Res music allows you to pick up on the subtle details and nuances that you would hear in a recording studio.
This video helps you to understand what is different and how it enhances listening experience.

Music producers and artists have long been aware of this, so they capture their recordings at the highest quality possible - in most cases, a quality that makes even CD sound flat and lifeless in comparison. But until recently, these master recordings were simply not available for the average listener to enjoy. But, as music-lovers ourselves, Sony created High-Resolution Audio products to give you that next best thing, next to being right there in the studio or live venue with your favourite musicians. So, if you're a music lover, the simple fact is you'll love High Resolution Audio. But in this video, I want to drill into you some of the fundamentals of sound to help you better understand why high resolution is such an important innovation and how we got to this point in the history of audio recording. Stick around - it's a fascinating subject. Music, like all audio, is vibrations in the air. An instrument, or speaker, creates high or low-speed vibrations which our ears capture and translate into a huge range of pitches and tones. At its most simple, a fast vibration, or high frequency, creates a high pitch, while a lower frequency one will produce a lower pitch. Other characteristics such as the shape and energy of these soundwave vibrations then determine the type and volume of the sound. Capturing and storing this audio for later playback has come in a variety of forms over the years, but it can broadly be broken up into three types: analogue, digital, and digitally compressed. Despite being less convenient than digital formats, a good analogue audio recording is valued even today for its natural, realistic sound. Analogue recordings, whether on magnetic tape, record, or even wax cylinders, capture and reproduce the sound vibrations directly. The needle on a record player is literally bumping along microscopic grooves, and those tiny vibrations are simply amplified into the electrical signals that drive your speakers. It's a good system, with few steps between the audio being captured and being reproduced. But it requires physical and sometimes fragile objects for storage - not ideal for the large music collections we all have now. A digital recording starts the same way as an analogue one, with capturing those vibrations, but these soundwaves are then converted to a series of coordinates. When a digital audio file is played back, those coordinates are used to reconstruct the soundwave back to an analogue signal which your speakers or headphones can recognise, and reproduce. All things being equal, the quality of a digital audio recording is determined by two things - the sampling frequency, which is how many of these coordinates are captured per second. And the bitrate, which is how accurate each of these coordinates is relative to the original audio signal. When the CD was developed by Sony and Philips, a lot of thought went into what specifications would allow it to deliver a good listening experience while being reasonably practical to use. The result was a sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz, or just over 44,000 samples per second, each captured at a bit rate of 16 bits, which determines how precise the height, or energy, of that coordinate is. Together, these two things determine the frequency range, or the range of pitches from low to high, and the dynamic range - the volume from soft to loud - a recording can contain. That 44.1 kHz sample rate gives us a range of reproducible frequencies of around 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz - roughly the capability of human hearing. And the 16 bit bitrate results in a dynamic range of 96 dB, easily enough to reproduce a live orchestra from solo piccolo to full noise. So, the CD remains a good format, but its physical dimensions and the inability to stream or download means it has been rapidly replaced by new compressed file formats. With much smaller file sizes and no physical size, compressed audio formats like MP3 or AAC are the way most people enjoy music now - whether via streaming services or from files stored on your device. A compressed audio file offers unmatched convenience. A good way to think about compressed music files is by considering a drawing on a piece of paper. If you fold up the paper you can fit it in your pocket but, once you've done that, it's impossible to fully restore it to its original state. How small the file is, is determined by the data rate. It's common for streaming services to offer audio at around 120-300 kbps, and most tracks you purchase and download are around 250 kbps. That's about 1/5th the file size of a digital track on a CD. Of course, not all digital file formats are the same either, so a modern AAC file sounds better than an older MP3 file even if it's the same file size. Think of it as more careful folding. We now understand that most digital music starts out sounding pretty good - at CD quality or better - but it is then compressed so that you can stream it on your smartphone or download it quickly to your computer. The real question then is what you're missing out on, and should you care? So here's uncompressed music... and a typical compressed stream. In that short sample, probably playing through your basic speakers or headphones, you might not hear much difference, but this is what you're missing out on... While compressing audio doesn't change the basic sound of a music track much, it does change how you feel about it. The more detail is contained in a music track, the more real it sounds, and the greater your emotional response to it. We've all been moved by music at some point - it's a powerful tool used by film makers, retailers, even call centres - so delivering all that detail to your ears quite literally changes how much you enjoy it. And that brings us back to High Resolution Audio. High Resolution Audio goes beyond even CD quality - offering higher sampling frequencies and bitrates. It's like using that really nice glossy photo paper for your picture, instead of regular printer paper. The use of higher bitrates like 24 bits rather than CD's 16 bits means you have more dynamic range, so you can accurately capture the tiniest subtleties - like the tap of a pianists fingernails across the keyboard, or the subtle break in a singer's voice - as well as all the impact of a drum solo. And all without compromise. The higher sampling frequency of perhaps 192 kHz, 5x that of CD quality, means a much wider frequency range is captured and reproduced. When matched with an appropriate amplifier and speakers or headphones, audio frequencies greater than 20kHz are reproduced, including ultra-high frequency harmonics - the subtle components of a sound which help to give especially acoustic instruments their character. We all know the experience of sitting in the audience for a live performance, and we know the experience is not the same as listening to a CD recording of it later. High Resolution Audio isn't just about hearing a difference, it's about experiencing a difference - the music may be the same, but the feeling and presence that the music conveys is what changes. We're lucky that recording engineers have known all this for years, so they've already captured audio in their studios at the highest resolution available to them. What Sony is offering with High Resolution Audio products is to reproduce that audio in your home, or headphones, exactly as your favourite artist and record producer intended you to. And a music lover couldn't ask for more than that!"
5,m31r1GHPPdA,Techmoan,UC5I2hjZYiW9gZPVkvzM8_Cw,MQA-CD : New Hi-Res CDs from Japan,"MQA-CD is a physical Hi-res music format, but while the discs are relatively affordable, playing them back can be anything but.
********** UPDATE (PLEASE READ)********
The sound quality difference I experienced between the MQA decoded CD and the standard CD audio is because rather than the CD being 16bit (as normal) - the patent says it's 13 bit with 3 bits used for the MQA data - however others now say it’s 15 bit with 1 bit going to the MQA. Apparently the MQA bit(s) get ignored as noise by a standard CD player. .

There are Loads of complaints about me saying that the ""MQA version sounds better"" - how could this be when Brothers in Arms can't ever sound any better than a CD as it was only mastered at CD quality originally"".  Well perhaps because that's not what was demonstrated in this video.

Angry Audiophiles - Just stop, take a breath - and read this paragraph....
 I wasn't comparing the full bitrate CD version of the album vs the MQA version. I didn't play the standard CD version of Brothers In Arms at any point in this video. 

The comparison was between the *compressed* version of the album (contained on the MQA CD) vs the MQA unfolded version (contained on the same CD). 

SUMMARY: In a test of the REDUCED BITRATE VERSION vs the MQA UNFOLDED VERSION.  
WHICH SOUNDED BETTER? 
A) The MQA UNFOLDED VERSION

So all I experienced in the video was the MQA version sounding better than the reduced bitrate version - which of course it would do. 

So next question... Will an MQA version of an album that was only ever mastered in 44.1khz 16bit sound exactly the same as a normal (non MQA) CD version of the album? - Yes of course it would,  if the album was only ever mastered in 44.1khz 16bit and that's the only version available it can only ever sound as good as that.

This is a useful site for downloading Hi-res Audio test files (including MQA) http://www.2l.no/hires/

Clearing something up that seems to have caused confusion.  
MQA existed before MQA-CDs in the form of Downloadable Files & Streaming. That's what all those USB decoders (including mine) are designed to decode.  MQA-CDs are new(ish) and only available in JAPAN- however MQA downloadable Files & Streaming have been around for a while.  These MQA-CDs are an adaption of the MQA format into a physical version that can be sold in Japanese stores.

Japan I've imported some of these and they might look like normal compact discs and in fact they are backwardly compatible with CDs however these discs contain high res audio and they're called ed and QA CDs and I'll show you in this video how you go about playing one of these and believe me it's a little bit more complicated than I anticipated when I set out so let's get on with it I picked up a variety of different albums so I can try the format properly we've got the blue ones here that a rock and pop the green ones are jazz this top one is a sampler disc which contains a variety of different tracks from different artists offered at a reduced price but overall these discs aren't all that expensive over in Japan they workout just over 20 UK pounds each at the moment of course once you've imported them that price goes up quite a bit now Universal Music in Japan is responsible for all these releases they release them on the 20th of June 2018 and brought out a hundred different albums spread across rock and pop jazz and classical I'll just doesn't wrap one of these and we'll take a look at how it all fits together there's a plastic sleeve that goes over the compact disc this is the part that contains the Japanese writing and all the information on the back it's a little bit like an OB strip you can see on the side there we've got the mqa CD logo and ultimate high quality as well I'll explain about that in a moment but that is just a slip case the CD itself is just a normal CD box in fact there's no Japanese writing on here at all you wouldn't know it was anything other than a normal CD until you open it up and you'll notice it's a green CD and the logo is also on there but it's quite discreet on the other side of it it's just a normal colored CD well perhaps slightly gold but you know pretty normal looking now if you'd get the booklet out of here you'll see that inside there there's a couple of inserts again about the mqa CD format that are in Japanese and this one is a lyrics booklet but you can see that this format could make its way to other countries by just replacing these inserts in the buckler's so whilst it's only in Japan at the moment it could make its way elsewhere you can see on the back of that booklet it mentions that these titles come from DSD transfers there's a lot of information on here that doesn't make an awful lot of sense but basically is tell you it's really good I'd love to be able to explain how these same QA system works but for some reason I just can't get it into my head I don't know if it's because they're not describing it very clearly or if I'm particularly dense but basically the idea is you start off with your audio it goes through this and QA process which shrinks down the size of the file and then use a decoder which then unfolds it as they call it they call it musical origami so they unfold the signal and it goes back to the original studio master at least that's the idea but honestly if you want to read up on it just have a look on their website I think though that its main headline feature is that you can get a high res audio track and you can compress it down and then own compress it and it's a lossless process but you've used a much smaller file to transport that high res audio now another thing about these compact discs is that their clusters being ultimate high quality CDs now this is the kind of stuff where I start thinking it's all a little bit of snake oil yeah the mqa thing I can understand that to a degree that is high res audio on a CD but this is all about creating a better quality of compact discs in the first place you see if you don't have an mqa decoder you can still play these compact discs in a normal compact disc player and apparently they're this amazing ultra high quality CD so before you ended up using some kind of polycarbonate which ended up with rounded edges now they're using a photopolymer which ends up with our sharp edges and apparently that's supposed to make you audio sound better as far as I'm concerned a CD is pretty much your CD so it's always going to sound like a CD it sounds like a good CD so that's something I supposed there as far as this mqa business goes well if you're listening to a normal CD is 4 to 4.1 kilohertz at 16 bit if you're listening to an mqa CD with the mqa part being decoded you're listening to 350 2.8 kilohertz at 24-bit so proper high res audio now I believe the mqa system if you're using Phi on a computer rather than this compact disc system you can have an even better quality than that so it's a little bit reduced compared to those but it's still a heck of a lot better than a compact disc as far as specs go and the discs themselves as we mentioned before don't cost an awful lot more and as I mentioned before we've got those samplers I've got that jazz one but you can also get a rock and pop version and a classical one the good thing about these samplers is they cost the third the price of one of those normal albums and for that you get a selection of tracks and you get an mqa CD and a normal compact disc which apparently have come from the same master so the idea with these is you're going to be able to do an a/b comparison by listening to the music on one and then on the other one just to see if you really can spot the difference so how do you go about listening to an mqa CD well there are a couple of different options at the top of the page number one those are the CD players that have a built-in MQA decoder and then at the bottom those are some external digital to analog converters which can decode mqa audio that sent them over an obstacle or a coax input which will be attached up to your existing compact disc player now if you have a look around you can't find quite a few cheaper mqa capable DAX but they're all pretty much like this device in that the design to be connected up to a computer via USB and decode mqa that's contained within files they don't have optical and coaxial puts so you can't just plug this one into a compact disc player right so let's return to the top of that list and have a look instead at what compact displays we can get which will decode these discs the cocktail audio X 45 mm 199 euros okay Vivaldi 166 thousand pounds I think we'll move on quickly from their Meridian 808 v6 eleven thousand parents right we finally hit one that's a little bit more sensible the oppo UDP 205 this is an ultra HD blu-ray player and while it's 1,400 pounds in the UK it's a much better option that the other ones we've seen now this is a good Ultra HD blu-ray player but it also gain the ability to decode mqa CDs when it received a firmware update in March 2018 the only problem is that this particular model is going to be discontinued soon because our poet are moving out of the blu-ray player business which is a little bit unfortunate because everyone really likes that player but I've already got a 4k player so I don't need another one of those and that's quite a lot of money to spend so let's see if I can use one of these external decoders with my existing compact disc player so these are all digital to analog converters we should take the digital signal from the back of your CD or DVD blu-ray player whatever and then it will go into this decoder it will be able to unfold this full mqa signal from the compact disc and you better to hear it through your existing high five so let's have a look down this list and see how much these cost so not good news I'm afraid 17,000 pounds 24,000 give or take who's counting 15,000 pound for that while 8,000 for this world and nearly 2,000 euros for that 105 thousand four hundred pounds two thousand eight hundred yeah we're not going to get a bargain here are we one thousand two hundred and seventy-five pounds going a bit better there and then the cheapest what I've found on that list nine hundred and forty five euros it's an ugly little thing that as well though but yeah 945 euros nearly a thousand euros so that list isn't an awful lot of use to me but it does mention on this document that these aren't all of them so I went looking around thinking well maybe they're just listing all the high-end ones for millionaires or something and I found this thing the project pre box s2 digital and the reason that I was interested in this one is because looking at it on the back you can see we've got a USB input coax input and an optical input on there and it's mqa compatible so I thought great I've found what I need here and the price on this was a lot cheaper than all those other ones at 300 pounds still reasonable amount of money to spend but I ordered one of these on the 1st of May 2018 and then the day after 2nd of May I ordered the disc to go with it there's stuff all came out on the 20th of June so this has been sitting around ever since it arrived in early May I don't want to get out of the box until my mqa CDs arrived but now that they've arrived I can finally set it up and we'll just see how this thing works so it's a simple little box it's all made out of metal it doesn't look like it's plastic but it is and and as we can see they're really in person puts on the back it's powered via five volt USB power supply we've got the volume control for the headphone there and press it into mute ofcourse it's a headphone amp as well as a DAC this so you can connect it up to your computer or use the coax or the optical on the back it just cycles between those three there this filter button moves between various things that have words that mean absolutely nothing to me I presumed these would sound difference one another if you were an expert in this kind of thing but I think once you get mqa on this I think all that's blocked out anyway and we can compensate for distortion if we want there with any of these things audio quality either best or test one that's just says audio quality best that's all you can out but anyway there's the software version and important thing noticed licensed under manufacturer from mqa so it mentions mqa in it out of the box so i plugged it up to my CD player here via coax and optical just in case one of them wasn't working put the power into the back and then put the RCA line level outputs in serve i amplify and pretty much ready to go now so just a matter of putting in one of these mqa cds and finally I can hear whether or not these things are worth buying now while the CDs sounded fine it seems from the display on this that it's just reading them as normal CDs is no mqa light showing it's showing at forty four point one kilohertz at the bottom as well whether I'm listening via optical or coaxial I went back to the computer to have a look if there were some mqa files I could just test just to see that this thing was working properly and I found this website which has some links to MEQ wav files you can download I'll put a link to this in the video description and you'll notice here from the size of that mqa file on the right hand side 17 megabytes it's quite a bit smaller than the other ones and apparently that is the original resolution so you can see the supposed benefit of this mqa system it's more compact files but without losing anything anyway I put that file into audacity played it back through my computer connected the DAC via the USB output put my headphone into the front of here selected the pre box s2 digital as the output device and sure enough it noticed it was an mqa file decoded it properly played it through the headphones and mqa lit up on the display with the 352 kilohertz at the bottom right there so I then went back on the manufacturers website thinking that maybe there was a firmware update for this device like the walls for the Oppo but no I've got the most recent firmware and then I got some bad news I scrolled to the bottom of the page and there was a FAQ section and one of the questions says does the device support mqa over the coaxial optical input and the answer is no that in order to enable that it would have to have a different chipset whatever and it would cost more and that question and answer has been added on after I bought my device on the 1st of May the last update on here was the 28th of May so unfortunately I thought this would do what I wanted it to do and it turns out that it's incapable of it from reading up further it seems the budget chipsets are in a number of different devices at the moment the ones that are affordable can only decode MQA over USB so therefore I thought well let me try and play one of these mqa CDs through the computer and I don't put the audio over USB just to see if that works now when I played a CD in iTunes it didn't send the mqa information through somehow he got stripped off so I tried a few different pieces of software and some kind of half works some didn't but in the end I switched over to my Windows computer so I've got this set up here so now I've got my external USB CD Drive and I'm just playing the CD back using the windows built-in CD player and it's working fine for decoding those mqa files on that external devices passing through all the information and banking here using these speakers that trouble is of course I really wanted it on my hi-fi I wasn't planning on listening to MEQ a seedings through my computer but I'm just glad I was finally able to get it to work so over the next few hours I went through most of the CDs listening to them over my headphones and I thought they sounded excellent it just I had a bit of a problem trying to figure out whether or not they sounded better than a compact disc until I got so this one now for some reason there's a bit of a glitch on this it's probably due to my janky setup but you can see the mqa light keep popping in and out it keeps dropping the signal for some reason but when it drops it goes back to the normal CD which is perfect because this comparison trying to listen to one disc and then the other one means that you listen to the CD you'd have to kind of memorize what the audio sounded like and then take that CD out and put the other one in gets the right track press play on that one and anything that sound any better it's like a minute since you last heard it being played you can't do a a very good a B comparison even though you've got discs like that also there's no way to turn on or off the MQA decoder on the device itself there's no button for that so you can't deactivate it every time an mqa signal comes through it's just going to decode it but because this dish seems to be dropping in and out of the mqa source we can actually hear the difference and you can tell the difference it really makes a significant change to the audio the mqa one just sounds so much better I mentioned previously that I'm not sure whether I'd ever be able to hear the difference between high rares and normal CD quality given the fact that my age and how good my hearing is but I could certainly tell the difference there when it jumps back and forth especially listening through headphones to the mqa version and the standard compact disc version or even the ultra high-quality CD version I much prefer the sound the quality of the mqa version it just sounds richer fuller deeper wider more spacious just something about it just sounds better now if you're experiencing a sense of deja vu at this point you're not wrong we have gone down this road before with SACD there are some key differences between the two though si CDs more often than not would include a surround sound mix of an album whereas at this point in time the mqa CDs are just stereo but many si CDs would also include a standard stereo version of an album which was taken from the same DSD master which they're using to currently produce these mqa CDs in addition many of the later si CDs were hybrid discs multi-layer discs so you could play back the standard compact disc portion of it in a normal compact disc player and the SACD layer well you play that back in either a dedicated si CD player or more often or not in something like a a DVD player that was compatible with si CDs but yeah there's no denying it MQ a CD definitely feels like SACD mark 2 now it's quite possible there are people outside there lining up with flaming torches and pitchforks ready to tell me that they think mqa CD is a ridiculous idea why would anyone in this day and age buy a physical music format when you can download everything off the internet or just stream it and I'd suggest to those people that perhaps this product isn't targeted at you then it's not aimed at converting people at download or stream music this is more further people that already just want to buy physical music but they want to buy high res audio out of physical formats and suggest also that is the people who in the past or maybe still collect si CDs but they're a little bit disappointed with the titles are available in this formats and if you do go searching for SACD subtitles are very expensive nowadays even if they were just released a few years ago and these mqa CDs aren't all that expensive the expense comes at trying to play them back as we saw I struggled a lot with that and I'd suggest that if these were going to take off in any way they need to come up with a way of making a nice cheap decoder or on folder whatever you'd call one of these things that attaches just to the optical and the coax output of a normal CD player at what cost perhaps a hundred pounds or so and then that my encourage some people's get interested in this particular format but again it's a very niche format and the final thing I'd say is it's really just aimed at people in Japan so if you're not in Japan and you don't collect sa CDs I'd say this was never really aimed at you in the first place but I hope you've enjoyed having a look at mqa CD here today and that's it for the moment as always thanks for watching [Music]"

Audio|mac|osx|itunes,2020-10-07 10:14:18.932945, a couple of years ago I spent quite a few weeks and a lot of time and effort ripping all my hundreds of CDs and putting them into iTunes that enabled me to put the CDs themselves up in the loft in a big bin bag but the problem is I've never really played any of them since even though I've only got a few vinyl records I'm much more likely to put one of those on than one of those hundreds of CDs are ripped to mp3s they're all stored on a hard drive which is kept under the stairs that's attached up to a Mac Mini which is on 24/7 so I should really be able to play these back very easily in fact I've got that linked up to the existing hi-5 set up back here I've got a solo which enables me to stream the music from that hard drive through the Mac Mini to this and play back through the hi-fi I just don't like doing that I'll show you why this is the app but you've got to get your phone out or whatever it is unlock it of course load the app up for the sonís thing wait for that to load pick an album I'll just show you how long it takes by the way there's a lot of album are missing here you'll see pop it in a minute but there's still lots of gaps and there was some album art missing in iTunes that vanished a couple years ago don't know what happening you have a picture for every single album but that was annoying when it started disappearing for some reason anyway wait for it to pop up here so we can see what we're actually looking out there you go there's a few pictures popping in but not really as many as we're in iTunes so we'll try and pick an album here to play back let's pick that one it will play back a particular track on it so we'll select a track press play and I think I have to okay that and that's it so look how long that was I know it's not the longest thing in the world but it's just no fun I much prefer mechanical buttons where you press play to play you press pause to pause or stop or skip actual mechanical physical buttons maybe I'm old-fashioned now so us used to do physical controllers for their device although they pretty much discontinued both of these there and moved over to the app base system but to be honest I'm a little bit over the soleus it's not quite doing what I want I'll lay out what I do want the requirements I've got a physical device and device with actual proper buttons on it it's got to use my existing mp3 live because I spent all that time ripping those couple years or so ago it's got a show Alba button a nice display on the front so I know what I'm playing I want it certain width to fit into my hi-fi set up I'd like brushed aluminium or steel or some flower to fit in with the other aesthetics I want it slick quick easy to use and also I might as well get something that can play these so-called high-res tracks your flack and lossless things if I'm getting something new so with all those in mind I picked up this thing it's a pioneer np0 1s the S is for silver they also do a black one of these I think it costs three hundred and fifty pounds approximately let's get it open and have a look at it and see how it performs so there it is it looks like it'll be alright nice big screen on the front there we've got the USB socket for it pone extra files into there para butter and a few controls on the front actual proper physical controls and of course it's got that brushed aluminium aluminium type set up around here on the back we've got audio air which is what I need to plug it into my hi-fi analog audio outs and on top of that we've got little controller thing here which links in with another set up that I haven't got like a Pioneer system or something we've got optical out there that's little stopper and then on the back here we can put in a network cable however I want to use it wirelessly I don't want to drag a cable across the room so plug in these or screwing these two aerials I can put those flat at the back there as well to keep it out of the way now the instruction booklet really isn't an awful lot of uses on a couple of pages in here in English and they don't make much sense but I think I could probably figure this out so that's the remote a lot of buttons on there really plugging my lead here into my existing amp so I can hear this playing back and we'll switch it on see what happens now it does take a while to boot up maybe it's the first boot or something but it took a while as a lot of flashing lights are fast forwarded this a little bit and that's disappointing into it look at the size of the screen the actual black area on the front it's not all screen some of it is just surround it's just that little square in the middle it goes in strange this menu it here as well ipod / USB that's the thing on the front so reading through the instructions after press a little setup button on that remote control she's the one just where my thumb is there so if I press that get into the setup menu and then we can set the network up so I can connect up to my existing network so let's put it on wireless and it's a reboot to do that that's a bit old school and to anyway let it reboot right we're back in couple minutes on enzyme and I'll pick up my existing wireless network which is that one of the top there then we're going to enter the password for that of course she's a bit laborious it's an old up/down and ok kind of curse a job so I'll skip past that right reboot again ok if we must so we've got to reboot to put those settings in anyway we're there now internet radio is now connected I can now go into that and I can pick her and internet radio station so let's just have a look at that while we're in here so you can see there aren't many things on screen at once I've only got 4 items to choose from but I'm doing it with the remote up/down and ok basically a little bit of a egg timer job there I'm win so it plays back into that radio as you can see now let's try and get my albums playing back on this well first off had a problem with the music server I was using Plex to serve the music across it wouldn't work with that I had to go and get a new piece of server software servio I think it's called that did actually show up then on the pioneer as an accessible music server so let's try playing something back through that and there you go it is playing but it's sir that album arts a little bit small for me it'd be much nicer if this kind of scroll with a touch I thought maybe a touch screen when I was looking at it in the in the brochure don't really read it obviously I'm only using a few buttons on this remote just in the middle there around the ok but and all these other ones are just a waste of space that's if you had like this pioneer hi-fi system it would control everything however I'm just using up down left right and ok and back really now controlling it on the device itself you can see here with only four items on screen at once it's taking a long time to get through my albums from A to Z in fat that Servier software doesn't seem to register properly my music collection and it's split out any compilations across multiple albums it's got itself a bit confused hey let's try and play back a track we'll try and play back word up by cameo so going to artists it's probably easiest way to do it pixie and then I'll find a cameo oh there they are just went past them ok that there is none picking misses I know it's somewhere in my collection so hopefully beyond here so go down all these which come here feature on there we go word Appel burn word up single okay you can see that took a wild into us not really what I was looking for that was a much too slow laborious and unpleasant way to choose a record it does have an app so we'll try it with the app although remember I don't want to use an app I actually want to use buttons on the device but look at this scrolling you can't scroll all the way through the thing you're going to scroll a little bit of time and then load in the next bit I think that'll be because it's over Wi-Fi or whatever it's not a it's got a pic it a little bit of the collection up bit by bit to better get into it but as you can see here trying to again let's pick a cameo record just to do the similar thing it takes a long time to go through this you're going to pick your letters and hard enough this really wasn't what I wanted when I wanted something better than the so nice in fact the solar setup pretty much works better than this and it's cheaper of course remember this thing costs 350 quid and the album art doesn't show on it so overall this is not the device for me very disappointing maybe somebody somewhere would like this if they were stupid but I'm not so I'm going to put it back in the box send it back and get something else and if you want to see what the other thing is watch part 2 of this video and the next item is something that's actually pretty impressive anyway that's it for the moment as always thanks for watching
7,AbLmpESH1NI,HyperX,UCmONQe9yHyPcETc5xdiZMcA,Hi-Res Audio - How To Listen to High Resolution Audio – HyperX Gaming,"At HyperX we’re constantly pushing the envelope to bring you the latest and greatest technological advances. Hi-Res Audio is a standard of lossless audio capable of reproducing a fuller range of sound from recordings that have been mastered at a level beyond CD-quality sources. In simpler terms, High Resolution Audio is closer to the original studio recording and takes advantage of a wider portion of the audio spectrum. HyperX is excited to deliver this technology to gamers.
The Benefits of Hi-Res Audio
CD-quality audio is encoded at a bit depth of 16-bits and a sample rate of 44.1kHz. The most popular digital formats, such as MP3 and AAC, compress files down even further. While these audio formats sound pretty good, High-Res Audio goes a step further, encoding audio at 24-bits and 96kHz to add a level of clarity and detail that was previously missing.  Hi-Res Audio’s 24-bit depth and higher 96kHz sample rate allow for a wider dynamic range and better frequency response which more faithfully recreates the original waveform. Nuances like the timbre and textures of sounds that would normally get lost are captured in Hi-Res Audio, providing greater clarity and a more satisfying listening experience.
Hi-Res Audio Requirements
To experience High-Resolution Audio, you’ll need to make sure that you have all the required Hi-Res components; content, a playback device, and an output device. Regarding the content, typically, these audio formats are Hi-Res versions of FLAC, WAV, AIFF, DSD, or ALAC files. You’ll need a playback device that can play the content in Hi-Res. Finally, you’ll need an output device that can handle Hi-Res formats, such as headphones or speakers that have been certified to have frequencies response of at least 40kHz on the high end. Be on the lookout for HyperX products that sport the Hi-Res Audio logo to get cutting-edge audio technology combined with that signature HyperX quality you’ve come to know and love.

Be sure to subscribe to our YouTube Channel so you’ll never miss a new video!  ► http://hyperx.gg/subnow",20,347045,257.0,2705.0,401.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AbLmpESH1NI/hqdefault.jpg,what is hi res audio|how to listen to hi res audio|hi-res audio headset|what is high res audio|hi res music|hi res audio explained|FLAC|WAV|AIFF|DSD|ALAC|hi res audio bit rate|hi res audio sample rate,2020-10-07 10:14:18.932968," At HyperX, we have never stopped innovating, Continue to bring you the latest and most outstanding technology and new results. High-resolution audio is a lossless audio standard, it can reproduce more complete The recording range, the sound is recorded at a level beyond the sound quality of the CD. In short, high-resolution audio is closer to the original studio Recording effects can utilize a wider audio frequency spectrum. Now, HyperX is very excited to present this technology to the majority of gamers. CD-quality audio is encoded with a bit depth of 16 bits and the sampling rate is 44.1kHz. The most common digital formats such as MP3 and AAC even further compress files. Even though the sound quality of these audio formats is already excellent, high-resolution audio does not stop there. It encodes audio in 24-bit, with a sampling rate of up to 96kHz, which adds transparency and detail to the audio that were not previously available. Let's take a look at this waveform. When we hear the original, uncompressed and edited sound, the waveform is what the sound looks like before our eyes. Here is shown when the bit depth is 16 bits and the sampling rate is 44.1kHz How do we reproduce the CD waveform. You will find that some details in the curve cannot be found in the sample. This is a good attempt, but let’s take a look at the high resolution of the waveform What will happen in the audio. As you can see, high-resolution audio uses 24 bit depth and 96kHz sampling rate, Can achieve wider dynamic range and higher frequency response, Thereby reproducing the original waveform more faithfully. The nuances of sound and texture are often overlooked, but high-resolution audio can accurately capture them. So as to make the sound quality more pure and clear, and bring a refreshing listening experience. To experience high-resolution audio, you need to have all the necessary High-resolution components; content, playback devices, and output devices are indispensable. These audio formats are usually high-resolution versions of FLAC, WAV, AIFF, DSD or ALAC files. In addition, you need to prepare a playback device that can handle content. Finally, you need to prepare an output device that can handle high-resolution formats, For example, certified headphones or speakers with a frequency response of at least 40kHz. Please pay attention to HyperX products with high-resolution audio logos and experience cutting-edge audio technology Get acquainted with the superior quality of HyperX you love."

one of those topics that usually be a factory of insults for those who treat them but take that risk because Rather than give a firm opinion on it, invite reflection and common in the channel so don't forget to contribute in the comments let's go with all the truth on the air but if i've still started The first thing is to clarify that hair is or high resolution is not concrete standard is to say that there is no official standard that tells us what minimum parameters or requirements must have a player or some headphones or a sound track so we can tell it's about even though it's compatible with airs, maybe in the future there will be but as far as I know there isn't but it is true that this expression is normally used in the field of sound to refer to audio signals with a bandwidth or range dynamic superior to what they usually give us formats like a cd or of course an mp3 I will try to explain a lot above some concepts without getting too into numbers we will talk in the video of digital formats vinyl for example this other story would be easily for a dozen videos like this the maximum audio quality that normally could enjoy a normal user at home was the cb quality perhaps the most Young people no longer know what this format is, it was designed with 16 bits and a 44.1 kilohertz sample rate doesn't have to do much either case to the figures but the important thing is that these were not chosen at random specifications allow this format to reproduce the sounds found in the frequency range that goes from 20 injured to 20 thousand hertz casually the frequencies at which the human ear works being that yes enough generous so in theory these keys should be enough. talk a bit about the process of building an audio file digital we have an analog audio signal imagine the sound that produces a guitar that has this shape for example this curve we want record that sound on a digital device that doesn't understand curves like it only understands number levels or dots to understand us by what to remember how the signal was and save it we must use dots on a tv uses a limited amount of information to store the signal that is later our players will interpret to give us an analog sound that is to say will reconstruct the analog signal in our headphones that is, they will return to draw the signal by means of the information that we keep in the cd because the reasoning for high resolution or high 3 is we are going to use more dots so that later when our player redraws the signal that is, it transforms the digital information back into analog music for us to do it more precisely more faithful to the original signal This greater number of dots is what is called the sampling frequency and is measures in kilo hertz and their precision is not the same as a big point that a tiny and exact one we could say is the resolution and is measured in bits so where in the cd were 44 like a kilo hertz and 16 bits in jair pérez can be 96 kilometers or more and 24 bits if yesterday very engineer of telecommunications watching the video will be doing the harakiri right now due to the lack of rigor of the explanation, high-resolution audio usually distributed in different formats, some of them offer compression without loss of quality alak there are a few more out there and that surely you have heard then for a drum roll what is We need a player to enjoy music, so very easy capable of storing and playing formats like those mentioned above technically even some phones can do it and also of course we will need some ear monkeys not one is like a stamp I do not know what means but simply good headphones with or without the seal so that we have seen in theory it is clear that we have more quality and point but friend really here the debate I have done nothing more than begin in half as we said, the human ear only hears frequencies approximately between 20 to 20 thousand hertz music files in high quality with the suitable player and with a high-end speaker or headphone set can give us much broader spectra there are people who claim that although these frequencies are not heard can be felt in your body and there are also people who get into technicalities explain that this makes the relationship signal / noise is lower at audible frequencies and others directly state which factors such as depth and richness of the audio track change radically with high resolution there are also those who say they have listened to blind and not notice any difference between cd and jairo is what I say is that suggestion does a long time but still more does a sound engineer in a I study his talent in these aspects in addition to that of the musicians of course is what matters most from my point of view whether on cd or on you are the main thing is to make a good recording and what is the problem then is that there are brands like sony or even technical audio that in some models use the sticker or label high is like claim in their boxes that spoils the market and above all deceit the consumer who believes that by being aires has a special construction or a technology superior to that already known lie they are the same hearing aids or players they can be great or lousy but the label does not imply anything they simply claim that they can reproduce these types of formats as thousands of models previously did and regarding what the headphones actually touch us as soon as you spend not much money is more than enough to enjoy sound in these formats obviously the better they are better sound you're going to get but technically any decent model is suitable to reproduce those frequencies and sounds what you have to remember is that if you want to get into this world, everything on our team must be in consonance files player amplifier if necessary and of course the headphones are useless if your headphones are sad or you use mp3 or you use the player of an infamous mobile in short we are in a complicated terrain where many factors affect you and your subjectivity so whether or not it's worth walking with this type of files finally depends on you and your ears but at least have clear what marketing is and what is not and decide on your own"
10,4qdJI4_OF5s,HandyAndy Tech Tips,UCD80RKxQODrPv-PdM3Js8IQ,Hi/High Resolution Audio EXPLAINED - Is it worth it? (192kHz/96kHz & 24-bit),"Hi/High res audio means music files recorded at 24-bit and higher than 44.1kHz sampling rates (often 48kHz, 96kHz and 192kHz). High definition audio promises ""better than CD quality"", and is being offered by companies like Apple and Sony. But can you notice the difference? Will your library of songs suddenly become more realistic and lifelike? And is the price that you pay (for devices like the expensive Pono Player) actually worth it? 

It is true that the higher resolution has benefits over CD when it comes to dynamic range and extended frequency response. But the files take up far more space on your hard disk for a quality improvement that's all but negligible. In all honesty, the loudness war, recording techniques etc make a far bigger difference in the end result than high-res audio ever will.

MORE INFO: 
[1] Nothing to see here, that's just an example.

[2] Undithered, 16-bit/44.1kHz audio has up to 96dB dynamic range. If you apply proper dithering and noise shaping to the signal, then you can theoretically hear a signal that's more than 120dB down - that's 24dB below the noise floor. (http://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/neil-young.html)

[3] You can't notice the difference when you're playing back 16-bit and 24-bit audio side-by-side. However, you CAN when you're recording. Multitrack recording at 24-bit means that far less quantization distortion is added whenever you apply an effect, adjust the amplitude, etc. (http://productionadvice.co.uk/dither-or-distort/)

[4] Why does CD go to 22.05kHz instead of just 20k? Well, history is to blame. Early CD digital masters used to be sent to pressing plants on U-matic video tapes, and the digital information was modulated into the analogue video signal. 44.1kHz was chosen because it resulted in the highest data rate that was supported by both PAL and NTSC cassettes. Weird, hey? (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/44,100_Hz)

[5] Well, we MIGHT. The reason why 96k (and later 192k) became standard in the pro audio world was because it was difficult to build an anti-aliasing low-pass filter that would cut off at 22.05kHz without attentuating the signal any more than was necessary. But for a consumer format, the oversampling on modern DACs has kind of bypassed that requirement.

[6] Yes, they aren't necessary for a playback-only consumer format. But in the pro sound engineering field, I must admit that they are quite useful.",28,309101,1546.0,4251.0,910.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4qdJI4_OF5s/hqdefault.jpg,high resolution audio|high resolution audio explained|high res audio songs|high res audio explained|high resolution audio music|high res audio apple|high resolution audio vs cd|high res audio vs cd|high definition audio explained|high resolution audio worth it|is hi res audio worth it|is high res audio worth it|24 bit audio worth it|24 bit audio vs cd|is high res audio better than cd|is high resolution audio worth it|high res audio benefits,2020-10-07 10:14:18.933037," Hi, it's HandyAndy Tech Tips here, and today I'm going to be giving you the truth on high-res audio files. You know, those files which are very expensive, which are supposedly better-than-CD quality, and which pop up on many websites, including the store for Neil Young's infamous Toblerone-shaped Pono player. Now, if you've got a good eye for detail, you might notice that, throughout this video, little numbers will pop up in the corner of your screen - like this one! So, if you want any more info on any of the topics that I talk about, just go to the area in the description that begins with the number! There, you'll find links and additional info. Now, back to the most important question - are high-res files any better? Well, to understand this, first we need to know about these two numbers here. What you see on the screen now is CD-quality audio - 16-bit, 44.1kHz. But if you're buying high-res tracks, you're likely to see 24-bit as the first number, and the last number might be something like 96kHz or 192kHz. So, what do these things mean? The first one, 16-bit, is what we call the ""bit depth"" of the recording, and essentially what it controls is the dynamic range - that is, the loudest and quietest possible sounds that can be reproduced. Examples of high dynamic range music include classical recordings, which have a large difference between the loud and quiet sections, which probably makes them annoying to listen to in the car. Now, the important thing to know is that CD, or 16-bit audio, can support up to 96 decibels of dynamic range. Whereas 24-bit, high-res files can support 144 decibels. So, can you notice the difference? No. Now, 96 decibels of dynamics is more than enough. In fact, I'm pretty sure that even the most dynamic classical music recordings still wouldn't use all of that range. And neither would any pop or rock albums released during the past 20 years. Because, over that time, a phenomenon called the ""loudness war"" has taken over the music industry. The idea is that the louder a single or an album is mastered, the more copies it will sell, so music producers have been bumping up the volume. But the problem is that that results in a loss of dynamics. In fact, most pop albums today use less than 1/10th of the potential dynamic range on a 16-bit recording. So, there's not really much point going to 24-bit if even 16-bit's potential is being wasted. So that's the bit depth covered, but what about the other number? Well, that's called the sampling rate, and it tells you the highest possible frequency that can be represented. You might know that other animals are capable of hearing far higher frequencies than us humans can. For example, most bats are capable of detecting frequencies up to 80kHz, but unfortunately, humans don't quite go that far, we can only hear up to 20kHz. But what about at the other end of the frequency spectrum, the really low bass? Well, around 15 or 20Hz is probably the limit of our hearing there. So, with these two figures in mind, it makes perfect sense that a CD-quality audio file is sampled at 44.1kHz. Why? Well, there's something called the Nyquist theorem. You don't need to worry about it too much, but essentially what it says is that the maximum reproducible frequency - eg. the highest frequency you can possibly record - is half of the sampling rate. So, if we have 44.1kHz, and divide that in half, the maximum frequency is 22.05kHz. And look at that, the frequency range that's covered is almost exactly the same as the range of human hearing. Now, think about it, if 44.1kHz covers the entire audible frequency spectrum, then why would we need any higher sampling rates, like 96k or 192? The answer? We don't. And, with that, I think we've just disproven all of the so-called benefits of high-res audio. The improvement in the dynamic range is not necessary, the improvement in the frequency range is not necessary. And honestly, unless an album is released with completely different mastering than its CD equivalent, it will sound - wait for this - exactly the same!

Play Store you'll find a plethora of apps that you can go ahead and install but how many of them are really good well we had riding tech tried a bunch of apps and came up with the top 7 music player apps that you can go ahead and install these apps have really interesting features like 10 band equalizer ringtone cutter automated tagging and much more so this is what we are going to talk about today hi guys is Ashish from guiding tech and let's get started so let's start with the first app that's called boom 3d music player and this is not only an offline music player but if you are a Spotify or title premium user you can play those online tracks through this app as well now you might ask what's so special about it that you would want to play online music tracks from Spotify on this app well it's the features like volume booster equalizer and the 3d surround sound enhances your / or listening experience and the 3d surround sound is a key feature that brings in positional surround sound using your headphones also the fact that it's not Hardware dependent is a cherry on top it also bundles a handful of sound related features that you can play around to tweak the audio output the free version like most of the apps has limited features with ads and you can go ahead and buy the premium version to remove all the restrictions along with the ads to get the most out of it moving on the next app in the list is only a music player this offline music player not only has a simple and clutter-free interface but also bundles many nifty features apart from supporting a variety of lossless and high resolution audio file support the app brings useful features like gapless play gestures and album odds the app also provides a 10 band equalizer and Google Voice command support plus you can always open the mini player by simply pulling it up and yeah the mini player also supports the album at the the issue that I found is that only a player adds all the audio tracks by default for example if you have snippets of whatsapp audio recordings the default scan will pick those as well actually you can choose which folder you would want to ignore however there should be a feature like ignore short tracks like you get that on power EMP or the stereo player next on the list we have HQ music player for Android 9 and this one is a very minimal gesture bass player just as you install and notch the player for the first time it will guide you on how you can use the gesture in the beginning it might take you some time to get used to it like swipe up for all the tracks swipe down swipe left for volume and so on but once they become the part of your muscle memory there is no going back the interface is clean and there's nothing distracting about it also this voice controls that will help you find the tracks without much of an issue so the gestures and voice combo works for the best however you just need to give it some time now the next half in the list is beatbox music player and this one is for you if you miss the stunning visualization of power amp this one comes with an array of eye catching backgrounds that make the app stand out from the rest you can choose nano player screen from it available list of 4 and the same is true to the theme navigating the app is buttery smooth though you will need a couple of days to get used to it it's bundled with an 8 band equalizer with controls for bass boost and virtualizer plus there is an additional support for loudness enhancer there are a bunch of other separate presets as well which you can go ahead and customize as per your taste moving on the next offline play that you should try is the in short music player now it supports all kind of popular music formats out there but the one feature that I liked the most was the customization of skins with it you can either go for the gradient look or have a single color painted on the main clip other than that there is the support for widgets navigation gestures mini player adds the timer also there are the contextual settings like pause or detach and lock screen playing which you might find useful now the only thing I don't like about the app is the little banner ads up at the top next we have a spy music player and app that has been traded for point 8 on the Play Store must really have something special of its sleeves right well my music player has been recently described as stunning and feature is bless the themes are a cherry on top not only does it seamlessly play all the music file it also doubles up as cool ringtone cutter all you need to do is tap on the option on the Left sidebar select the songs make the necessary adjustments and you are done if you're someone like me who likes to segregate their music files into neat folders this Android app will let you choose which folder to play at a particular time moreover it comes with a handy widget that lets you have all the controls on the home screen instead of driving into the app every time you want to change a song one more USB of this app is the PI power share feature which makes it possible for you to share song with anyone around the world easily and now last but in no sense the least we have the most popular Android music player out there the power MP and if you haven't heard about or use it I suggest you go ahead and install it right away by the way all the links are present in the video description now talking about the app it has been recently updated in the last few months with a new audio engine UI and navigation the player has one of the most amazing features out there like different volume levels made 30 50 100 and you can find that settings under audio advanced weeks you also have 10 band optimized graphical equalizer and the support for custom presets along with that you have powerful bass and treble adjustments stereo expansion mono mixing balanced tempo control reverb music effects and a lot more now there is a trial version that you can go ahead and install and try the application for seven days without any restrictions and if you liked it you can go ahead and purchase the full version as a separate app on the Play Store so well guys those were the top best music players out there for the 20:20 now if you liked the video do give us a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to our channel please do hit that subscribe button and well that's all in this video and I hope to see you in the next one until then take care and have a wonderful day bye bye [Music]

If you truly care about sound quality, you'd stop listening to music on your smartphone and instead invest in an MP3 player. MP3 players might not be as famous as they were a decade ago, but that doesn't mean they're outdated technology. An MP3 player or Digital Audio Player is an electronic device that can play digital audio files and is a type of Portable Media Player. There are a large number of mp3 players available in the market with various features, so before buying the product, you must choose wisely. So if you are looking for a suitable product, then these are some of the best in the business. 
Enjoy superior sound quality, wrapped up in the colors of your world with the all-new Sony NW-A45/B. This Walkman supports playback of PCM, AAC, WMA, and MP3 audio files, among others. It features 16GB of internal flash memory and supports microSD cards. Its built-in rechargeable battery provides up to 45 hours of continuous audio playback on a full 4-hour charge. This device offers a 3.1-inch TFT color LCD touchscreen with an 800 x 480 resolution. You can also pair the Walkman with other compatible devices over conventional Bluetooth with NFC. Also, the proprietary operating system works with Mac and Windows computers and utilizes a simple drag-and-drop process for quickly moving songs from your computer library to the Walkman. However, you can use it as a USB DAC, circumventing your computer’s sound card and achieving the better sound in the process through the unit’s S-Master HX amplifier. Further, it is optimized for High-Resolution Audio, and its S-Master HX amplifier reduces distortion and noise, allowing you to enjoy all the subtleties in your music.

review,2020-10-07 10:14:18.933702, on the super review let's take a look at the bio m3k digital audio player so one of the first products that I bought at the beginning of this year was a sony a45 walkman which as it turns out has been one of the things that I've used the most in my life and for a lot of you it might not make any sense why is a person using a Walkman an mp3 player in the year 2018 well we can get into that or we can just assume that it's a good idea and I'll talk to you about the file m3k on paper the file m3k is gonna do a lot of the same things that the sony a45 does it's gonna play all those lossless audio files that I like to play it's going to be able to function as a DAC for my computer if I want to use it for that it seems like it's roughly the same size and and similar battery life this thing has got about 24 hours of play time which is pretty good especially when you're starting to look at other you know higher-end daps that cost a lot more money run Android and don't get that kind of battery lives 24 hours not too bad what makes the file really different from the sony a 45 is the price the sony is around 200 bucks 220 bucks something like that the file in 3k it's only 70 bucks and to me 70 bucks makes a lot of sense so if this thing can perform similarly to the sony a 45 but for less than half the price i'll be pretty impressed and frankly if you know as long as it sounds good I'll be pretty happy with a $70 player like this that said we're gonna find out is it any good let's go ahead and unbox it we'll find out what you get inside the box of the file m3k then I'll give it a listening test put it up against that Sony a 45 which may not be fair because it's twice the price but I have a feeling they're gonna be a little bit closer than you might think let's check it out alright so we got the file m3k portable high resolution music player call it an mp3 player called add app call it a poor-man's ipod call it whatever you want this is a thing that only plays music I sensibly I'm pretty sure it only plays music and again I'm not gonna get into right now whether or not this is a good idea for me it's a good idea if you're watching this video probably a good idea if it doesn't make any sense to you well I'm not gonna make that argument but here we got it in seventy bucks I want to see what we get inside the box so a quick tour of the box I mean we can do it but there's not much info here there's a bunch of info here in the back that let's see it weighs 77 grams is does that help you that doesn't help me it's got the dimensions which is small yeah there's not much here to learn what I do know about this thing is one it supports high res audio not that that necessarily means anything but the fact that they went out of their way to get that certification typically means something at least so nothing to learn from the Box let's just go ahead and crack it open [Music] all right so we got the file m3k out of the box and we'll you get you actually get some kind of nice thanks frankly let's see over here we'll start with a relatively thick instruction manual that is a fold out style that I'm gonna avoid looking at as best I can get a warranty card and then a little card that talks about some of the open source licenses of this uses that's actually kind of interesting I'll have to dig into that and a little bit more detail later you do of course get a USB cable for charging this and ostensibly for transferring music to this worth calling out I think especially because the Sony Walkman that I've been using it uses a proprietary cable it uses USB on one end and then some WM port on the other end and I was surprised at how many people take issue with the fact that that cable is a proprietary cable now it is annoying it hasn't been a huge hindrance to my usage of that device but it has been annoying and it's nice that the fiyo of course it uses just regular micro USB and then of course it's got USB a on the other end of that but interestingly this thing also comes with a couple of adapters just in case you're using a laptop that doesn't have USB a so it comes with one adapter that is USB a 2 USB C alright this would be really good for people that are rockin new MacBooks or even you know a lot of entry-level smaller laptops as well as a USB a two micro USB in case your laptop or your device that you want to connect this to only has micro USB maybe you could connect this to I wonder if the DAC functions would actually work through those connectors that's interesting yeah I was also surprised to see that the file came wrapped in this silicon case which I can put back on it if I want to I don't think I'm going to though frankly and it just seems like one of those things that's gonna collect a lot of lint and dust and kind of never look quite as nice as the raw dog device itself and I think this is a pretty good-looking dab so I'm probably gonna leave it like this that said if you're concerned about you know dings and scratches and stuff like that it is nice that they come with a silicone case and then we get to the device itself which is even smaller than I thought this is a really nice compact size it's maybe a little bit thicker than the sony nwa 45 but it's definitely slimmer in this dimension so in fact let me go ahead and pull in the Sony just for comparison so here's the Sony a 45 which I think is a pretty good size it's been pretty convenient for me but you can see that the file is definitely narrower and it's even a little bit shorter if you look at it here you can tell that the file is indeed a little bit thicker but not by much and I think that's well frankly I think that's a pretty good-looking player right there along the bottom here you've got your micro USB port for charging you've got an SD card slot and then you've got the headphone port which I think they've treated that quite nicely that's very handsome on this side you've got nothing on the top you've got nothing and then over here on the side you do have a power button volume up and down and then a pause play toggle and those are all the buttons you get compared to the Sony n.w.a 45 you do get a few more buttons over here you get power button you get volume up and down and you get your play but you also get track skip forward tracks get back and a hold switch which is that's nice though one thing that I don't really like about the sony is that it has a little door that fits over the top of the microSD card and it's actually a pain in the butt to get that thing out but yeah that's about as much as I can tell you about this thing without using it so without further ado I'm gonna go ahead and charge this baby up and load it up with music and I'm gonna live with the file m3k for a while and see how this compares as a as a digital audio player to my Sony Walkman and how it compares to you know maybe just using a phone and see if this thing is worth 70 bucks I'll be right back [Music] alright let's talk about the fiyo m3k which is a $70 music player then in a lot of ways is just as good as my $200 Walkman but in some ways which we'll get into it's definitely not as good alright let's start with the good stuff which you know really this build quality is one of the most impressive aspects of this player it's got this all aluminum design it's got a great size a great weight to it it feels good in the hand got a glass front or I think it's glass it feels like glass might as well be glass generally yeah it's just a really nice looking player that feels great in the hand the other really important thing that m3k gets right is the sound quality this is a great sounding player listening to it back to back with the Sony there's no obvious like trade-offs with this player there might be like some slightly perceived differences in sound like this might actually sound a little bit cleaner whereas the Sony sounds a little bit fuller but that could also be entirely in my head I'll just say this this thing sounds perfectly perfectly reasonably good no complaints with the sound quality at all in fact there are some things that this does better than the sony including just the noise floor if I plug in my KZ a s 10s they're probably the most sensitive any air monitors that I've got if I plug those into the Sony I can hear a slight hiss when nothing is playing if i plug those into this m3k there's no hiss so that's pretty impressive and then in terms of output volume this thing gets plenty allowed for most headphones that you're gonna be using if you're using something like the sennheiser HD 6 series right I think it's a 300 ohm headphone this will just barely get those loud enough for my listening preferences they don't get quite loud enough on this when that's the same you know with the sony walkman these are just not that high-powered of devices but really good for most headphones including pretty much any in ear monitor out there whether good stuff is that this supports microSD cards up to 2 terabytes now as far as I understand there's not actually any 2 terabyte microSD cards out there yet but they have claims they are future proofed for 2 terabyte cards and then the software is generally pretty attractive pretty handsome it's a little consistent in some places but it looks good it moves pretty snappy in fact the Sony a45 has got some slowdown in some places that there's no slowdown on to m3k which is pretty good and it's also got some nice features like okay you can browse music via id3 tags or you can browse music via folders if you prefer I think that's always nice that they do that for people that don't keep their id3 tags in order and then this also has a really nice a be repeat function where you can select a portion of a song and just loop it over and over and over again which is it's probably annoying for most people but for nerds like me that want to compare headphones it's actually a really useful function a little clumsy to use but I'm happy it's there now it is a $70 digital audio player and you can spend a lot more money on players like this so there's got to be some some compromises right and there are and some of those compromises I think are totally reasonable I'm not gonna hold these things against it but there are things that you should know one of the compromises is that the n3k does not have bluetooth you want to hook up a pair of bluetooth headphones to this it's it's not gonna work and for me like that's not a big deal the reason that I would get a player like this versus just using my phone is so that I can use a wired headphone so I don't I don't care that it doesn't support bluetooth another thing that the m3k is missing is built-in storage my Sony Walkman that's got 16 gigs of built-in storage this has zero gigs of built-in storage but again I'm actually not gonna hold that against it because I don't care this thing supports microSD I'm gonna put microSD in it regardless of if it has built-in storage so the fact that there's no built-in storage I really don't care there are some physical buttons on the device but there's not a ton you can play and pause you can change the volume and you can turn it on and off with the physical button you can't skip tracks and that does limit like it's it's pocket ability or right or how well you can operate this thing when it's in your pocket so that's one thing that's worth calling out and then the screen it's a fairly nice screen but it's not a touchscreen and that's not a big deal for me I think you know most people are used to touchscreen so you're probably going to reach up and try and touch it at some point and it's not gonna respond but that's a compromise that I'm perfectly happy with instead of using a touchscreen they've got a touch UI that operates down here and it's it's okay it's okay it's got like this this touch slider that again one of my one of my complaints with it is that it's not super precise it can be difficult to navigate precisely on a list of items but again like that sort of you know the UI compromise that's something that I'm okay with on a $70 device some of the compromises I'm not totally happy with on a $70 device let's start with a couple of physical things that I think are worth calling out that headphone jack it's a nice looking headphone jack isn't it in my experience this thing is too tight it just it makes it kind of a pain in the butt to insert a lot of the headphones that I've got I've had to really shove them in there and it seems to be getting looser over time it seems to be getting better so that might be a problem that improves the more you use this unit but that is something that I don't expect on a $70 piece of hardware another thing I didn't expect is the micro SD card slot on this thing the first time the first few times I put a card into it it would not give me the card back I had to use a pair of tweezers to pull it out and now it actually functions totally fine in fact if I wanted to I think this thing would eject the card across the room if I tried so it's gotten better i I'm not sure what changed but at least at some point this thing was not giving me Nick cards back and again that's not a problem that I expect on a 70 dollar piece of hardware and then actually the bigger issues that I have with this unit are more around the UX design of it which are disappointing to get wrong because okay design is good design is not necessarily cheap but it scales really well right you design something well the first time you can repeat it for free every time after that it's not like Hardware where you know more expensive hardware it costs every time you need to make a new version of it design doesn't require that and so it would have been nice if the design the UX design of this was a little bit better alright so if I had like some software crashes very rarely occasionally but that's not the kind of stuff talking about what I'm talking about is for example this play pause button you would think that having a physical play pause button means that you always have access to being able to pause your music but that's not the case in some contexts this button will actually act as like a menu selection button which just means that if you're not on the right screen you can't pause your music which that's I think that's pretty bad design and I think that's a simple thing to fix but I mean I've got the latest firmware on this and as of today that's still a problem similarly this thing has got skip buttons on the touch panel right skip forward and skip backtrack switch I think those are good functions to have an always available buttons but similarly those buttons don't always act as skip buttons in some context though Acta's navigation right menu navigation which I think that's just a bad idea and and it's things like that that make this more of a chore to use then it should be and they're very simple things that file if you can correct those things Informer you're gonna make this a much much better device to use as it is it's a pretty good device it sounds brilliant but it's got some UX issues if I were to rate the file m3k out of 5 stars I'd give it three stars out of five look I love the way this thing is built I love the sound that comes out of this and I really love the idea of a seventy dollar audio player like this that gets those things so well done it's disappointing that some of the UX design problems are there it's disappointing that there are a couple small hardware issues but you know frankly I can look past those I just really want this play button to always play I want the play button to be able to wake the device from sleep currently it can't do that and with software I think it could I think with software software updates they can make this a really easy four stars out of five currently I give it three stars out of five which is still a pretty decent buy for 70 bucks especially when the next best option I have is a two hundred dollar Sony Walkman if you're interested in checking out the m3k I do have links to Amazon

DP x1 digital audio player this is just hit the market and it looks to provide a fantastic audio experience to the consumer and actually runs on Android OS if you're not heard of Onkyo before they provide all different audio solutions from amplifiers and speakers for home use than they do portable amplifies headphones and also now apps as well I will put the full link down in the description box below and check out in a bit more detail other solutions they provide but looking at the DP x1 today when I first got invited to check this out and then I read that it was on Android then this is definitely something I thought we've got to have a look at something very unique and actually brand-new to the market and I'm going to when you feel we need to know about it so it's got a top-class stack an amplifier built in based around the Android OS you've got two different modes on there you've got a standard balanced out and then you've got active control ground which at the two different modes of shoes later on there's a 2.5 millimeter 4 Pole and a 3.5 millimeter 3 Pole output you've also got connections to use a micro USB or OTG digital output if you wish you can connect it to a PC and use it that way as well closed loop designed to limit all the noise there's also a nice little option on there which disables all the wireless and Bluetooth cuts out all the interference that could possibly get into the sound there's lots of different options for expandability as well with micro SD cards then you've got options to download your apps straight from the Google Play Store now this uses high res audio which at this moment in time is quite a new thing to the market and there's not that many files this kind of thing that's slowly starting to get to market and in a few months time we're going to see a lot more come out for me this is very much a case I'll find the songs I know and listen to them and compare them to what I usually pay them on or other sources rather then I kind of find the songs I know and love that I listen to every day because not all of them are available just yet but as I said in the coming weeks and months we will see a greater variety of music come to the high-res format so getting into kind of the outputs you can play using the analogue 2.5 and 3.5 outs you can go PCM 192 kilohertz 24-bit and then use the hi-res playback which is PCM 384 kilohertz and 24-bit using the digital mode you then go on to eleven point two five point six or two point eight megahertz native playback you've got the PCM at three eight four kilohertz and then 24-bit just the same as using the analog output you also got support for WAV FLAC a la C and also AIFF files looking in the nice presentation box you've got those to the device itself then to the right of that underneath we've got a micro USB cable two standard USB a then you've got a nice thick instruction manual as well now the first thing I noticed when I got this out the packaging was just how well-built it was it's got a very nice weight to it and I like things a heavy pretty purchase because I know they're built well generally when they are heavier and it does look great as well in my own opinion it's not much bigger than a phone as well so will sit comfortably in your pocket this is my iPhone 6 with a battery case on smaller but it's generally wider slightly thinner as well than the battery case so they give you a kind of rough idea of the dimensions are able to get the few know the full spec dimensions I will put the link down below now on the bottom we've got a small microphone as well as the micro USB B / the OTG output for power and data transfer so you're going to charge the device as well then on the left side of the device we've got the volume knob which has 161 steps to get a really precise fine adjustment to your music far too often when I use say for example my iPhone I can't get a nice balance but this is obviously going to give you the exact spot you want for sound sometimes it can lag a little bit when you do 10 up and down but that's kind of if you're really going to pump the volume up also got a lovely smooth control in there as well on the top we've got the two analog outputs with a three-and-a-half millimeter headphone jack and then the two point five millimeter balanced headphone jack now on the lower right hand side of the device we've got the dual micro SD card slots these support up to 200 gigabyte SDXC cards so then you've got potential 432 gigabytes of storage including the onboard 32 gig then on the upper side then on the upper right hand side we've got the power button a next track which also doubles as fast-forward play and pause below and then that one we've got the previous track which also doubles as we rewind so going onto the screen and the more of the functionality with the Android OS this is a 4.7 inch touchscreen panel then at the very top right we can see the mode that we currently got selected which is that ACG which is active ground control mode so I've been down from the top we've got very familiar controls obviously from general Android that we use on a daily devices and smartphones then this is the little mode we've got to change the output a cg is what I've generally been playing on and then if you use the 2.5 mm education you can go for the balanced and then obviously turn off as well little recommendation that's to not use both at the same time as you may damage the device go through the menus is nice and smooth and this is the little standalone mode I briefly mentioned earlier this turns off all Wi-Fi and bluetooth capabilities to give you a nice clean signal and make sure there's no interference going through at all to make sure you get the highest fidelity possible through the output here you've got your screen brightness control slight bit of delay using that but again it's no major issue and then using the buttons on the side you've obviously got control for play pause next track previous track and then here's the scroll wheel functionality you may see here when I start to really crank the sound there's a slight lag in it where it just catches up like with the screen brightness it's no major issue using the buttons on the bottom of the screen obviously we've got the home button there's a back button and also the most multitasking window just like any other Android device and then Spotify is a great example or for something you can download from the Google Play Store as it's just like another Android phone you can download whatever you fancy so Spotify was generally my my go-to app for music playback just to give things a little bit of a quick test then when I start to really kind of knuckle down and listen to certain areas of songs then this is when I went on to the actual app that's built into the device and then we went into kind of precision listening and you know listen back to the high-res files what you can get from Spotify for example right now you're probably screaming at me to get on with what I think about the sound so here goes this isn't a cheap product is it worth that figure at this point in time how is it all the different types of formats that I tried didn't have any problems with any of them that's an would happening out there because you know android supports pretty much everything anyway using the different modes I found the ACG to be my favorite there wasn't too much zero difference in them to my anyway but you know got the options there should you want to use them the 2.5 millimeter jack may be useful to some personally it's not something I use I've tested from the 40 extensive range of headphones that I have here anything from 20 pound headphones up to 250 plus to give a you know generalized idea of what we can expect everything sounded better as you'd expect anyway everything in clarity and detailing was improved highs were probably what I noticed the most significant change to sound staging was fantastic as well string and orchestral pieces were the ones that stood out for me this was also a factor of the high res files not having that big of a range of different genres and some was available at this point in time this will start to expand in the coming weeks and months as highways kind of makes a bigger dent into the market of sound I didn't have any problem driving any headphones as well every pair that I tried did work flawlessly one thing to note is don't leave your songs in pause when you you know go to bed for example make sure you turn the device off as you can drain the battery quite quick if you do leave it in pause one thing this needs to have an emphasis on the need is a screen protector just something to protect that screen that was a worry of mine just using it where it's not a cheap device it's kind of one thing I do really hope they sort soon even if they get a third party to make it then it needs to be done another thing that would be nice to have just a carry case whether it be just a fat one or a nice little small hard case would be great as well but yeah it's supposed every fall that I tried fantastic sound experience I love the Android operating system the scroll wheels awesome as well built like an absolute tank looks great feels great sounds great yeah it's awesome guys I will put a link for this down description box below including the website link for even more specifications in details and I've reeled off in this video I hope you enjoyed this video it's quite a long one for me and but this is something that we couldn't just do a simple video on and there's lots of things we needed to cover and I hope you still enjoyed it anyway if you did enjoy and you haven't already please consider I really appreciate all

everyone welcome to Lachlan likes a thing the show where I take a thing and see whether or not I like it now the thing we're looking at in this video is the new Sony nwz de 15 Walkman music player now this is going to be quite a long video because there's quite a lot to get through with this little thing we're going to start with my impressions of the interface we're going to move on to the all-important question of sound quality we're going to talk a bit about the enhancements that you can choose on this player with the audio and then we're going to end on a discussion of the high resolution audio capabilities of this player now this is the nwz a 15 model of 16 gigabytes of on-board storage there's also an NW said a 17 with 64 gigabytes of on-board storage they're both expandable microSD I don't know if the a 17 is going to be made available in Australia I did buy this a 15 it has a recommended retail price of 249 Australian dollars though I have a friend who works at a retailer so I was able to buy this at a significant discount which is something you should probably know um anyway let's get started so as far as the physical build and design of the nwz a 15 goes it's a nice looking music player it's not amazingly premium and kind of fit and finish there's this nice brush metal top plate to it but the rest of it is just plastic the LCD is you know fairly poor actually by today's standards it's fairly low resolution and somewhat reflective in direct sunlight it's certainly not as nice in terms of feeling as the nwz zx1 flagship walkman certainly not as premium feeling as that but it's not really any biggy it's expected at this price point and also I would say overall this kind of form factor it's a relatively small player as you can see in comparison to my hand it's a relatively small player and I think this is actually much more of a realistic option to carry around in your pocket then the zx1 especially if you're already carrying around a smartphone with you so this will basically just kind of slip in your pocket and not really you know take up that much more additional space now we'll go into the interface now I'm not going to give you a full rundown of how the interface works but I'll give you some of the bare basics and I'll give you some comments now the way music management works on the a-15 is that basically you drag-and-drop music files on on the player through the included W import USB cable so you have to use a proprietary connector which is a bit of a shame I wish it was micro USB or at least there was an additional micro USB port but anyway you chuck files onto the player and then once you've finished doing that the player scans through all the folders and then assembles a music library and it uses the meta information the tags on your music files to arrange them with album genre artists etc etc now you can also browse through the file structure manually and this is where you'll notice something interesting in that the system does not treat the SD card storage and the system storage as a unified pool so when you connect it to the computer you have to choose whether or not you want to add files to the USB or the SD card so we choose which one we actually transfer which is a little bit confusing but we say if I plugged it in right now it would expose the 16 gigabyte of system storage and then if I changed it to sd card then next time I plug it into the computer it will register the 32 gigabyte microSD card that I've put into this slot here so it's not a unified pool but that doesn't really matter because in the end it scans through the library and it treats it all as one big library in the end it just separates it in terms of the internal file structure so something worth noting now some of the things that I will note about the interface it's a relatively simple and easy to navigate interface the only criticisms I have of this interface is that sometimes it's a little difficult so if I choose a song and then I want you to jump back to the now playing screen I'm going through all this it can be a little difficult to jump back to the now playing screen so I had to press the option button and then I had to go just to the right and then press go back to playback screen or if I go all the way back to the main menu I have to navigate down a few steps to the song playback screen it's not a huge thing it's just a little one or two too many clicks then I would necessarily prefer I would have liked it that there was a dedicated control there's some sort of dedicated button to jump right back to the song that you're playing right now the other thing that I should mention is that I've noticed that with the album art but I have embedded in my files that I transferred over to this player this a-15 cannot read album art that's that's larger than seemingly a thousand by a thousand pixels and I have high resolution album art on these albums just because sometimes you you know send them out to TV by something like an Apple TV or something and then the album art is quite blown up in size so you want a high resolution picture so as you can see all these files have embedded I will not but it's not showing up on the player which is a little disappointing but again no be now there's some other random features on this player there's things like a Bluetooth which you can use to connect to bluetooth speakers but you can also use to send and receive files I haven't tried that I can't tell you if it works there's podcast support but there's no you know way to subscribe to podcasts or anything like that you just manually log them over so it just seems a bit you know pointless then we have this sense me channel function which analyzes your music and then suggested based on kind of categories of mood and genre that kind of thing it actually works decently well I've tried it on previous Walkmans it is a cute little feature they have but it's not you know essential in that regard and then there's an FM radio which is actually really to have just in case you want to listen to something that's been curated for you rather than futzing around with your own kind of music collection but that's yeah that's pretty much it as far as the interface goes it's relatively simple it's just an evolution of the previous Sony Walkmans and I think it's pretty no fuss no frills works well now let's move on to sound quality but before I begin really talking about the a-15 I wanted to preface this section by talking a little bit about my review of the Sony MW ZD ZX one which is the flagship Wolfman that you can buy today now in my review of the ZX one I was really not very positive about the Zed X one but I think that my review was slightly misinterpreted by some people now I didn't like the Zed x1 and I said that the Zed x1 sounded very similar to my iPhone 5s which is what I use as my you know my daily music player and I made that conclusion based on volume matched listening tests between the ZX one and the iPhone 5s now in isolation to say that the ZX one sounds like the iPhone 5s is not an insult because the iPhone 5s is considered to be a high quality music player it's being demonstrably in all available public measurements it's been demonstrated to be a high quality high performance music player so it's not that bad of a thing for the ZX one to sound like the iPhone 5s what I was really disappointed about was the fact that these ethics one is priced at the price of a premium smartphone so I would have expected it to have premium smartphone components like a good LCD screen a fast processor it didn't have either of those things and I would have expected for the price and given that it was a dedicated audio device I expected it to sound not only as good as the iPhone 5s I expected it to sound better it didn't sound better and in fact it had a kind of ever-present hiss with certain earphones and headphones that I tried that was not present on the 5s and considering that that is a very obvious aspect of the performance of the player or the kind of high res audio malarkey aside considering that the hiss was very noticeable I found this EDX one very disappointing now with the a-15 I'm going to say right off the bat this sounds very similar to how I remember these EDX ones something I don't have this EDX one on hand to directly compare but it sounds very similar to how I remember the ZX one sounding and that means it sounds very similar and I've done volume matched listening tests for my iPhone 5s it sounds very similar to the iPhone 5s and in that context considering the price of this player that is a good thing so again I have done volume matched listening comparisons between this player and the iPhone 5s and again I do find that this is a good sounding audio player with a good clean kind of output it's got a slight hiss to the sound that comes out in certain earphones and headphones I have so if I use for instance the NuForce primo 8 the hissing is quite apparent in the Sony Xperia e3 I can hear a bit of background hiss that I don't necessarily hear on the iPhone 5s something like the V sonic VSD 3s even a cheap dynamic driver IEM is capable picking up that hiss so it just seems like a bit of a luck of the draw which earphones pick up the hiss on this player but again it's not something that disappoints me as much as it did on the ZX one because this is a third of the price of the Zed x1 it's much more of a convenience size and has expandable memory and it's rated for a very long battery life so I should point out it's rated for thirty hours of high res audio playback and fifty hours of mp3 playback given all these things I think it's much more a reasonable proposition and I'm much happier about the performance of this player compared to the price now this player is not especially powerful so I plugged in my AKG K 712 Pro on this player and to get to a reasonable listening volume you have to go past about 80% on the volume control but it seems to drive every earphone and portable headphone that I have reasonably well so if you're using this as a portable player I don't think you should be too worried about the power output of this player now I don't have on hand other kind of comparable e priced audio players to compare this to so things like the Pheo x3 the x1 I borrow units etc etc I don't have those on a hand to compare with so if I ever get a chance to get my hands on those and I do have friends who do use other brands of kind of audio players I will do some more kind of listening comparisons but right off the bat I'll say this because it sounds close to my iPhone 5s and the 5s sounds close to my object of to amplifier I'll tell you it's you know pretty good audio output apart from be underlying background hiss so let's talk about the very sound enhancements that you can enable on this player for your music so this player has a number of interesting sound enhancements so when you bring up the options you can turn on something called dsee h-x many Walkmans i have owned in the past had some variation of the dsee technology basically what i can ascertain about dsee is that it is essentially an EQ boost to the very highest frequencies of the sounds so frequencies that are generally truncated on very low bitrate mp3 and AAC file so generally if you go you know below 128 K mp3 the the the algorithm automatically just removes all the frequencies above 16 kilohertz and stuff like that and as far as I can tell what dsee does is that it kind of tries to restore those frequency is essentially through equalization by enhancing the volume what sony claims to do with d seh x which is the new version is it up samples the original compressed CD quality audio - the equivalent of high-res so if you are up sampling CD quality audio which tops out at 22 kilohertz in terms of maximum high frequency sound what dsee claims to be doing is restoring frequencies that are beyond the range of human hearing so ultrasonic frequencies which I can tell you is just silly but what I can tell you is when I listen to this setting turned on and off it does seem like there is a tiny bit of shimmer added to the sound as if there was a tiny little notch on the equaliser for the high frequency sounds it's really a subtle difference considering its additional processing and waste battery life I generally just leave it off the other setting that this player has is a clear Audio plus this apparently uses although Sony's are unique of digital signal processing tools and basically when you turn this on it makes things sound artificial and horrible and I have no idea why it is on the player I think it might be meant to be used with specific Sony earphones I don't really know I just leave this off it sounds terrible there's also the various kinds of sound settings like the reverb settings you can choose on this player so you can choose various kinds of things that will give you a sense of artificial space and soundstage these are all interesting to have but not particularly useful then there is the equalizer which is probably the best aspect of all the sound enhancements because it allows you to have a custom kind of 5 band EQ or set preset equalizer settings so with the equalizer you can adjust various settings now Sony has a thing called clear bass which is actually a really good equalizer setting this increases the base on a particular audio file but it only does it to the extent that it does not result in clipping the audio file so if you go too high with clear based on existing base you track it won't push the base up to the point where it causes distortion and clipping it won't go beyond full scale volume and it won't like cut off the peaks in terms of the base but if it's not a basic file or add more bass up to a certain degree so that's a really clever intelligent way of implementing a bass boost and I've always liked this about Sony players now there are a few more settings that I just wanted to mention because they're quite amusing you can actually have a number of settings there's a karaoke mode that you can use that tries to remove the vocals from a track so that you just have the backing instrumentals and I've seen this on earlier Walkmans it doesn't work perfectly but it is something cute to have on the player then we have some new settings I haven't seen reformed a Walkman there's a new dance setting and basically what that means is that you can have really quick kind of you can set a specific range to play back over and over again if you're practicing a particular move and you can also change the tempo on a track so I can make it go faster or slower again this would be helpful if you were trying to learn a dance routine with this song and then similar to that setting is also the language study setting which again lets you repeat over a specific range over and over again and it also lets you press a button to really quickly replay the last are a few seconds so again if you wanted to study the way a particular expression or phrase sounded you would use that setting now these things seem very Japanese in nature I have to say so it's not a killer app but it is kind of fun to have on the player so let's talk about high resolution audio and the nwz a 15 and if you've seen some of my earlier videos on this topic you will know that I'm about to jump into a big rant about high resolution audio because high resolution audio is a misleading marketing campaign put together by marketing departments of big manufacturers to encourage you to buy a bunch of products for reasons that do not enhance your listening experience it is basically misleading and lying to consumers um now I don't love jumping into the big technical explanation of why this is the case but I believe that as a reviewer I have some responsibility to kind of inform you about high resolution audio especially in any kind of public discussion about high resolution audio high resolution audio is basically audio files with higher bit depths and higher sampling rates than CD quality so that means a higher sampling rate than 44 kilohertz and a higher bit depth than 16-bit now a bit depth higher than 44 kilohertz just means that you can encode in an audio file frequencies that are higher than 22 kilohertz now that means that you have to have the capability of being able to hear frequencies over 22 kilohertz which I'm sure dogs will enjoy but really not any human beings can really get much benefit out of frequencies higher than 22 kilohertz and also a good luck finding audio equipment that can playback frequencies above 22 kilohertz because basically if you look at the published frequency response of most headphones they just fall off a cliff after about 22 kilohertz so that's basically all a bunch of ball um 16-bit audio so you have a bit depth higher than 16 bit it means that you can have a higher dynamic range than 16-bit so it means a higher range between the louder sound in a recording and the softest sound in the recording higher than 96 decibels of difference between those two extremes now good luck again finding listening environments where you can listen to a 96 decibels sound and also still here the the quieter sound in the recording the 10 decibel sound may be above the pre-existing background noise in the environment that just doesn't really happen in the context of portable audio let alone kind of when you're at home with air conditioners etc etc and again good luck even if you do have that kind of ideal listening environment good luck finding albums that have higher dynamic ranges than 96 decibels or even close to 96 decibels because most albums put out today do not even come close to 96 decibels of dynamic range even most classical recordings the difference between the big kind of drum noise and the tiny little triangle noise doesn't come close to no nice accessible so again CD quality audio is more than enough to capture the information in the recording and deliver it to your ears right and don't get me started on DSD because basically DSD which the a-15 doesn't play DSD just means that you can you know it basically is meaningless because most recordings that you can find in DSD were actually encoded first in PCM and then mastered in the final stage in DSD because it is impossible for technical reasons to work with DSD recordings in the studio it's just very difficult to work with so basically everyone just uses PCM and then masters into DSD now unless you're the kind of person who believes that are encoding an mp3 file into a lossless file somehow magically upgrades the audio quality you understand why it's very stupid to suggest that encoding something in DSD when it's originally in PCM will somehow magically enhance the audio quality so that's you know I I do intend on making more videos to explain the technical reasons behind the things that I've just said about these various aspects but I will tell you right now that all this high-resolution audio stuff is its equivalent to TV manufacturers if one day TV manufacturers started saying oh we've made a TV that can display Ultra pilot light which your eyes can't see but actually it's somehow enhances the picture quality and everyone sat around in forums going oh I can really see the picture quality improved by the ultraviolet light that is you know being projected into my eyes and you know everyone is afraid to basically call out the emperor on the new clothes well I shouldn't say everyone because there's a lot of reviewers who have stood up and said that this is all kind of rubbish but I I don't think that it can be emphasized enough how misleading the high-resolution audio marketing is now I say all of this because of one thing on the nwz a 15 so the NW z a 15 supports playback of files up to 192 kilohertz sampling rate and 24-bit bit depth so when you play a file that is high resolution audio so for instance I have here dr. chaski sensational fantastic and simply an amazing by normal sound show when you play back these files a little high resolution audio icon lights up to let you know that you have entered the zone of high resolution audio and you can actually confirm this you can go into detailed information and you can bring up information about the track including codec the bitrate the sample rate and the bit depth now what is really interesting about the NW 0 15 though is that Sony has also put a switch on this player and what this switch does is that allows you to down sample high-resolution audio songs to see the quality and they call this a sound enhancement for some bizarre reason I think this is probably poor English but basically what that switch implies is that it is down sampling a high sampling rate high bit depth song to a 44 kilohertz 16-bit audio output which is what CD audio is now I have played around with this switch and I can tell you that I can't really hear any difference when I play with the switch and turn on and turn off the a down sampling maybe there are some differences I hear maybe my brain is making things up because the placebo effect I can tell you is very powerful even given what I just ranted to you about with high res audio I find myself kind of listening for the symbols and trying to see if there's extra resolution even though I know that you know all of that stuff is meaningless but I can tell you my gut impression is there's basically no difference when you turn on the down sampling and you turn it off and I have confirmed with the audio meter with my recording device that when you down sample a song it does not change the volume level of the song so I used a 1 kilohertz signal and it does not do any kind of change in volume that would make you kind of hear a significant difference so this means a number of things if I can't hear any difference it means either that a the switch does nothing which seems unlikely or B that the switch does something but it turns out there's something that it does in terms of down sampling high res audio CD quality sorry down sampling a high res audio files to CD quality doesn't actually produce any audible difference and my money is on the latter now you have to ask why did Sony put this switch on the player in the first place because this switch is basically like the child and the story of the Emperor's New Clothes the child who cries out in the in the crowd or the Emperor is in fact you know naked you know there's no clothes at all and I have no idea why Sony would kind of shoot themselves in the foot by putting a switch on the player that lets you kind of just find out that high res audio actually is kind of consuming meaningless but some people have suggested that this switch is for battery life I don't think that's likely because down sampling a file still requires you to read and process the entire file and then do the down sampling and the conversion on top of it so anything that would use more power and maybe Sony is so confident that people will hear a difference just by the SIBO effect uh that people will think that high res audio is worth it you know they'll do what I did but without you know my kind of research in this kind of thing and they'll go oh I do hear a difference actually it sounds completely different and you see this all the time across all kinds of forums now that kind of stuff cuts both ways of course because what this switch does is that it means that the a-15 can be used as a portable high res audio excuse my french but a portable high res audio detector because you're going to easily do a blind test using this switch and how that would work is that I can give this player to someone and they can play around with the switch and they can say oh I hear a big difference between the high res audio and the not high res audio the down sampling and then I can take the a-15 away from them and I can do the switching myself and ask them if they can hear which one is the original high res setting and which one is the downsampled setting now what I've just described to you is a single blind test but there are ways that you could arrange it so that you can do a double blind test with this player so that's kind of really you know interesting to have on a player and if you don't know what the importance of a blind test is I have some videos up that kind of explain that kind of aspect of sound science but basically that's what's really got me excited about the a 50 and I'm going to be doing this kind of blind test using the a 15 and that particular switch so I'm sort of really excited about the player in that regard and I think it sounds pretty good too so yeah so in summary I think the nwz a 15 is a good music player so it has a nice simple interface it has a good clean output though it does produce a little bit of hits on earphones and some headphones but not all overall I think all the kind of high resolution audio kind of malarkey aside it is a nice choice if you have a smartphone that maybe doesn't have such a great audio output so apart from things like the HTC One m8 and the iPhone 5s which have good kind of audio outputs if you don't have one of those kinds of smartphones maybe this is a good upgrade over that kind of player it's also a good choice I suppose if you want a dedicated music player but I don't have on hand there other kind of products that I can directly compare it to in this price point I'm pretty happy to recommend this player on the basis of these kinds of factors and the low price of the player so take from that what you will anyway I click the like button if you found this video helpful and consider popping a tip into the tip jar my reviews are supported by you guys so thanks a lot for that you can talk me on

Walkman|Sony nwa35|Sony NW-A35|Review|Hi-Resolution|Audio Player|Sony Audio Player|Sony hi-resolution|walkman|player|audio,2020-10-07 10:14:18.933835, [Music] this was a spur-of-the-moment purchase to be honest I've always been looking at high-resolution portable audio players and assume that the one I'd eventually get would be one by CEO earlier this year Sony announced a range of new portable audio players aimed at audio files including the gold n wwm ones LED as well as the much more affordable NWA 35 it's at this point I have to say that Sony's product naming conventions are terrible there aren't too many reviews on the internet for this so in a way I was buying this blindly so here are my thoughts on this high-resolution audio player the NWA 35 has the thickness of an older iPod Classic but the overall footprint much closer to that of a nano unlike other audio players there isn't a scroll wheel or front-facing buttons all the buttons are placed on the sides and the front is the display panel only the player is very light and comfortable to hold it's made out of a combination of metal and plastic good enough for the price but don't go dropping this in the bar for on the ground outside the buttons are clicky and responsive it has a very nice look overall the range of colors is very nice too and there's a cool walk from the logo on the back on one side is a covered slot for a micro SD card expansion the nwa 35 comes with 16 gigabytes of internal memory i've stuck in a 200 gigabytes and disc memory card for more space now as i said previously this is a touchscreen interface the buttons on the side allow you to play or pause skip tracks and change the volume track selection and navigation is done through the screen there's no sign of an Android operating system here and this UI is focused solely on finding and playing your music the touch screen is responsive and music loads quickly with a stored on the internal or external memory my biggest the most pleasant surprise is with the quality of the display it's a three inch 800 by 480 WVGA display which doesn't sound like much on paper but it's great for this audio player even the thin text in the UI is displayed clearly however mark looks great the backlighting is even and it even has a wide viewing angle one side out this is a laminated display it sits close to the glove ass with minimal noticeable air gap the display is quite reflective though which would be my only complaint now as well as saying at this point this is an audio player only no video playback photo viewing apps or games you play your music or you don't they are your options I favor this approach to be honest it means you have a clean user interface and more space on the internal memory let's face it the extras you sometimes get on these types of devices are usually half-baked anyway you have a range of options for navigating your music library by artist album genre release year or composer there are also further categories for playlists high res which is above CD quality folder navigation and sense me a system where music is automatically categorized by mood for you take advantage of setting up playlists or using sense me you need to use Sony's media Go application which annoyingly is only available for Windows PCs no Mac support so what about the sound it's the most important consideration here well I'm new to audiophile listening and because sound is so objective I'm not going to tell you it sounds great I'm going to tell you that in my opinion this sounds great one big difference between this audio player and many others is the number of sound customization options there is a six band EQ with a number of presets and custom options the EQ does have an impact on the sound so you can tweak the settings to suit your own taste there are also further options for upscale compressed or CD quality audio to the equivalent of higher res or do the DC phase linearize ur allows you to have the low frequency responses resembled that of an analog amplifier you can also select dynamic audio environments such as a studio or a concert hall and you can normalize the volume between your different tracks I've listened to a range of music from different artists in both CD quality and high-resolution FLAC as well as a demo tracks in DSD I view the pair of Sennheiser HD 5 line ASE open-back headphones and I've seen really been impressed there is just one problem this product is almost brilliant apart from one thing is 2017 and Sony insisted that this audio player is charged with a proprietary cable main microUSB or USB see it's an annoyance as is one extra cable that you'll need to take with you overall I can wholeheartedly recommend this audio player it's great value for money and in my opinion superior to the increasingly popular players from Pheo so that's my quick review of the sony walkman nwa 35 if you found this video useful please like comment and subscribe and I'll be back soon with another video [Music] you

Compared to the A45, the A55 now sports a smooth aluminum finish with curvier edges that make it easier to hold. There’s been changes under the hood too - compared to the A45, the A55 has a higher contrast display with noticeably faster UI performance, which makes Sony’s already great user interface that much better to use. The A55 also features some new sound enhancements including upgraded high res upsampling and an interesting new Vinyl Processor mode, which I suppose is fun if you like your music to sound warmer with tubbier bass. Also inherited from the higher end Walkmans is the new Bluetooth Receiver function, which allows you to beam music from your phone or computer to the A55. This is useful if you want to listen to say, Spotify or podcasts but prefer the output of the Walkman. Speaking of output, just like the A45 the A55 has lower than average power output, which means that we do recommend it for pairing with dynamic driver and hybrid earphones, and easy to drive headphones. With those the A55 produces a clean and punchy sound with a useable 120 steps of digital volume control. The A55 still has a significant degree of background noise, so we can’t recommend it with sensitive multi-balanced armature IEMs like the Campfire Andromeda - for those, try out the Sony ZX300. This is Lachlan for MinidiscTV - see you next time!"

However, if you hate any detailed equipment with smart phones, ZX300 will be very suitable for you Sony insists on using its own WM interface This makes it very difficult for users to find accessories such as an OTG cable for the ZX300 Unexpectedly, Sony’s Bluetooth receiver mode works great The delay is very small when compared with USB DAC mode. Conclusion is Sony ZX300 Among these three, it is the best pure player, especially when driving earplugs and high-sensitivity headphones If you need streaming media software and pursue a minicomputer We usually try Avery and SR15 Compared with Sony ZX300, the output power of SR15 is sufficient Avery's system is stable and easy to use, it also supports Tidal and Spotify However, due to the screen size of the SR15, some small print will be difficult to read The battery life is also a bit short in a small player, which supports about 10 hours of playback Because of these factors, we would recommend Sony’s player more Unless you need streaming software Finally, let’s take a look at FiiO’s M11, the latest release among the three From the paper data, FiiO M11 has many advantages It has the biggest thrust, the biggest screen, the fastest processor And the most complete output interface, including 2.5mm balanced, 4.4mm balanced and 3.5mm standard single-ended output The built-in Android system also extends support for third-party software And FiiO provides several unique features such as receiver mode for Apple Airplay and USB Type C interface that supports fast charging However, FiiO M11 has the biggest problem Although its output gain is high, and the thrust is enough to push full-size big ears This also caused the promotion of high-sensitivity earplugs such as Campfire Andromeda and Empire Ears EVR The noise floor will be obvious and always there The same even in low gain mode The noise floor is so big that we really can’t feel at ease Recommend M11 to those who listen to high sensitive earplugs Of course, because the M11 has a large screen and the machine is very smart The body of the M11 is the largest among the three machines in this comparison. And many people don’t want to bring the second It’s about the same size as a mobile phone, and a device twice as thick as a mobile phone moves around So I hope you can see in this comparative evaluation that no solution can meet all your needs That’s why we provide all three digital players in the Minidisc store Write the best player you think in the comment area You can also buy in our store or online I’m Lachlan from Minidisc TV, see you next time"

10:14:18.933914," that's a pretty cool KFC feature you just push this button and KFC will come and deliver you some chicken if you'd like but there's no point in having it on if you're not how to use it so NFC off I like this really cool sense me channels like that you can press this and it will sense your channels whoops so the evolution of my music players have definitely come a long way of course I got some CD players and there somewhere but I don't have them anymore Sony AMD player the Microsoft Zune my second walkman technically PSP which was after a while pointless to play music on third Walkman and of course the fourth Walkman and I know what you're thinking you're thinking this thing has been after a while why are you making a review of it now it's been out like a year or two not exactly sure but to be quite honest I would have purchased it a year or two ago but this thing would just not blow up it's like a tank and it still works to this day and it still holds a charge really well I just figured it was time to get a new one and just in case you guys didn't know last week was Sony's 40th anniversary of the Walkman so of course I'm gonna buy this thing I actually had no idea was their anniversary till after I bought this thing so this is the Sony NWA 45 high-res music player look I even polished the screen just for you guys I'd but there's your actual exterior box and then of course we have an interior box which does how's the music player itself when you open the box the music player will obviously sit nice and snug within this little rectangular cutout and it does actually have a nice little plastic wrap around the music player itself so doesn't get damaged or scratched so inside the box of course you'll find your charging cable and some instructions and all that kind of stuff actually doesn't come with as much stuff as the Pheo x1 came with but it's a better music player in my opinion so so I did forget to mention that this is the charge cable that it comes with like I said proprietary charge cable and it does take about four hours to charge from dead so the NWA 45 is pretty much a touchscreen music player now you do have some external buttons on the side here which me personally I do like that a lot so if the screen is locked you don't have to unlock it to change modes or change songs or volume up and down some music players aren't like that they're 100% touchscreen but on this particular one you have a play pause fast-forward for a whine you have your hold button here your volume up and down and of course your lock screen and power button on top press and hold the music player for more than about two seconds and it will automatically turn on creating database pretty similar to my previous usek player so a lot of people don't realize this but when you purchase a high-res music player and you're transferring all your music over to that device whether they be AAC mp3 or pretty much whatever format they are they don't automatically convert to high-res a lot of people don't realize that you have to purchase or download a high-res music from specific sites regardless of whether not you download your music from iTunes or Amazon or wherever you get your music from the sound quality on this particular device sounds absolutely amazing the equalizer pretty much covers almost every frequency on the top left-hand icon you have your radio you can click on that and go to pretty much any radio station you want go back and this is basically the main menu you can't store photographs or videos on this thing not that I know of at least here's your high-res section now remember I said that high res I didn't think high res was that big of a difference it's a big big of a deal that wasn't the selling point for this music player I needed a new music player and they pretty much all nowadays have high res audio so the battery life on this thing is actually really good it's like 45 hours at full charge and then here's your high res audio section now this thing does already have some preload music on here which sucks I'm just kidding actually this patty file this one's actually not bad it's ex Scottish folk music but you have DSD and you have flock your direct stream digital I think and then your flock which is like lossless audio two different formats but both same thing hybrids music I'm not gonna play any music for you guys mainly because it's not like you're gonna hear a difference anyways you're listening to it on a phone or a tablet or a laptop so not all you're gonna hear the difference so we'll go ahead and go to your album and here's all your music not exactly sure what that was I'm sorry folder now this thing does have expandable memory which is really cool I think it's expandable all the way up to a quarter of a terabyte so you can put 256 in here if you'd like we're just gonna go with the onboard storage it's blurry sorry I'll fix that right now then we're gonna head and click on a song I don't have headphones plugged in got your headphone jack your proprietary charge cable which is pretty much the exact same as the previous or you know my old music player pretty much the same thing you got your attachment for a lanyard which is kind of weird because if you're listening to headphones it's kind of hard to hold that around your arm but it does have a lanyard attachment if you want to use that and of course Bluetooth obviously bluetooth I don't use that much now something else you guys may not have known Bluetooth audio is actually a little bit it kind of it's not as good as listening to hardwire like auxilary or headphones it may not be that much and you may not even notice it but technically it does alright so we'll go through your all your modes totally lost I don't even know where I'm at okay so we'll go through all the modes here after setting mode down here and all of your settings right here playback setting output setting device setting clear Audio plus sound setting you can choose different headphones clear phase ambient sound mode noise canceling if you don't have those headphones hooked up and I don't have those headphones so so you can't actually choose those headphones so just go to the other so we'll go to the soundest settings you can change a lot of things the equalizer on here is fantastic by the way you can choose any frequency really from 60 Hertz I live to 16,000 kilohertz or 16 kilohertz 16 thousand Hertz basically adjustment here and you can go by and adjust each individual frequency if you'd like I pretty much have it set to this because I notice it sounds pretty good the reason why is because you have your VPT surround me I am personally a huge fan of this particular program or this particular setting in the software for this music player this one had it this one's got it a lot of those do have it they replaced one with the other but regardless if you have studio club concert hall and matrix there Heather not it actually sounds like a concert hall when you're listening to it it just sounds different and I kind of like it so I basically always have it set to concert hall of course you can choose to turn it off if you'd like or turn it back on but there your feet peaty surround sound like I said I don't know if it actually does legitimately sound like you're in a studio or a club or concert hall matrix I just know that sound is different and it sounds really cool when you have in a concert hall so I'm just gonna leave it on there I've always had it on concert hall and this was actually called club so they replaced club with concert hall in case you guys were wondering dynamic normalizer you could change that minimize volume difference between songs which is pretty cool you have your DC phase linearize ur makes low frequency response more like an analog amplifier I did change this back and forth but didn't notice much of a difference maybe you have to have different headphones maybe gonna have different speakers who knows you have your upscale the original compressed or CD quality audio - equivalent of high res audio I always have that off I turn it on doesn't really make much of a difference but like I said I don't have 400 hour headphones so clear audio well you choose clear audio you cannot choose your sound settings unable device settings of your beep setting which is I don't know why anybody would have the beep setting on because when you're changing songs it makes a beeping sound disable touch panel when the hold switch is on do have that screen timer and choose between basically how long you want the screen to stay on before automatically shuts off I have 3 minutes just because it's brand-new probably when it gets old and doesn't hold the charge very well I'll put it on 15 seconds USB connection setting auto power off one hour now that's I believe if I honestly don't know if that's if you're listening to music or not I just haven't messed with that and tried it although I have listened to music for more than an hour at once so maybe that just means if the music player is on but not playing music who knows now battery care that is another really cool feature that this music player has instead of this one as well it seems to have worked I have the battery care on this music player on this mp3 player and I've had it on since I got at 7 years ago and the battery life and the basically the time between charges is still really good so I imagine this battery care actually works and Sony knows what they're talking about maximize the life of your battery by never charging it past 90% it is technically bad to charge your phone at a hundred percent every single time so if you're watching this and you didn't know that trying to charge your phone to like 90 percent if it's brand new or relatively new and it should make a difference believe it or not over your course of your basically lifetime of your battery lithium batteries do to deteriorate and you've charged them all the way up like that but anyways there are your settings charging change your language playback settings so there are a lot of things on this music player that I haven't really gotten into yet I changed all these settings Union in from whoops didn't mean do that totally went back to that display lyrics by the way you can't display your lyrics unless the lyrics were downloaded with the song so it doesn't automatically know the lyrics have all this long as you put on your music player in case you didn't know detailed song information you can change on our start change you can check all the information about the song do you upload it or that you downloaded length and all that stuff that's a pretty cool little thing a little feature to have so we'll go back to the settings output settings ABL s volume limiter that limits it to 60% or something like that it's kind of pointless to have it on auto though if you don't want to click on the volume up and down and by the way 90 seems like a pretty high volume but it doesn't really start getting loud until 90 so comes all up to 110 or something like that I don't know now there is some distortion in the audio when you get past 110 115 so it's not good to turn it all the way up these music players honestly don't have that loud of an basically signal so I do have to use and a lot of people probably use a headphone amplifier I've always used them not to blast my ears out but truthfully these music players just don't go that high in volume touch this play button right here and you can change your music volume like this pretty cool kind of like an analog volume knob okay so one more feature that's really cool about this mp3 I'm sorry some people get mad when I say that one more feature that's really cool about this music player I've had people really get on to me for saying mp3 player on my previous video is a long time ago my fee Oh technically it is still an mp3 player because it does put mp3 so I'm still gonna call it that an mp3 high-res music player there you go can't get madami the NFC feature a lot of phones and stuff devices have them nowadays but your battery will technically last a little bit longer if you just leave that off so I do leave it off and I never use it so there's no point of having it on when you have this thing on it's constantly this is basically constantly sensing for a another device to transfer music over so if you plan on never using this feature you might as well leave it off because it could take battery life and I do still have some friends that say things like why are you still using these music players nobody uses these things anymore they're almost obsolete everyone uses their phone for streaming you know there's nothing wrong with using your phone for streaming and I honestly think there are millions of people that have the same mentality as me I think there are a lot of pros to having a music player separate from a phone you know where companies like Theo and Estelle and plenty who and Sony they wouldn't be making these music players the way they are because I think they're still popular I think some people still buy these things I think it's a lot more than you think advantages and pros I think to having a separate music device like this are things like what about data and your patter Elife I mean you're constantly streaming music it's taking your data away I mean yeah you may be you've got unlimited data but it's constantly taking your battery life away you can't leave your phone plugged in to your car all day long it's just going to destroy your battery and maybe you can carry around an external battery bank but that's just kind of ridiculous why would you do but my favorite one of course is when people say well when you have a streaming site you have an endless supply of music okay but first of all I do also have a streaming app that I use I pay for a streaming site also so I download music from Amazon and I do have a streaming site that's how I find new music but I also buy it as well so I just wanted to make this quick review and maybe some thoughts about this music player and if you're thinking about getting one i really suggest that you do if you've got a huge library music then I really think Sony does make the best music players and faeo and a Stellan planner they also make good music players but I've been a Sony fan for years now so I'm always gonna stay true to this particular companies are basically just my thoughts on the Sony NWA 45 high-res music player so thanks for watching everybody"

man|acoustic research|high res music|HD music|headphone listening|headphones|portable player,2020-10-07 10:14:18.933963, hello I'm Jane you join me in the audio affairs court today and I'm going to do a quick shoot out of the high-end high-res portable music players we're going to check out the color fly see for the hi-fi man HM 901 s the acoustic research AR m2 and the Pheo x7 so we'll start with the color fly c4 it feels really nice to hold it's got a nice quality to touch with an attractive wood back finish and engraving it's quite a niche style almost has an 80s look to it looks a little bit retro a bit vintage so it has a lot of character it comes with a nice leather leather case and has 32 gigabyte storage onboard which is expandable and has twin Cirrus Logic DAX it has up to 24 bit 192 high-res decoding and a full response at lower volume it's it's a little bit chunky which is quite nice I think that adds to the quality of the feel but it's not as heavy which again adds to the convenience of its portability you can also select the bitrate so it's convenient for that and for your choice and it has a high-end volume slider pop from Alps and it's just 549 so then we've got the high five man h-m 901 s this is a brushed metal feel looks aluminium type it's a bit heavier well-built and the software is a bit more intuitive than the color fly c4 it uses dedicated software for playing music it's made for one thing and that's to play music and it does that really well and doesn't have too much other stuff going on I quite like the jog wheel to run through to select the music and that just adds to the character it has a fun volume control really easy to roll through the volume and adjust add your preference it has no internal memory it's all on an SD card and to charge it you do need to remove the back to pop the battery in the cradle so it's not a case of just plugging it in like you would with other models but I quite like that because for me that enhances the quality that you need to carefully take it apart and take them time to enjoy the process and this one is 1099 pounds now we have the acoustic research AR MT this is far more modern it has brushed matte metal look feels more like a mobile phone and I quite like the swipe to unlock feature makes it quick and easy to use it runs Android which is really good feature because you can download apps like Spotify and tidal it just feels a lot smarter and has a full-color nice quality screen it has built-in flash memory and a 64 gig and expands up to 128 gig and has nine hours battery life with a lithium ion battery on board and a separate SD card and this one is $8.99 so now I'm going to look at the Pheo x7 this one's brand new the market is only a couple of months old this one's a bit heavier than the acoustic research because it's a little bit thicker but still really sleek it has this really nice blue light feature on the front which adds to the modern look it has an amazing feature which is the separate dedicated headphone amp bolted onto the bottom and runs on Android you can see it just looks really modern it has a gig of ram on board runs really fast and acts on a command immediately it's really quick smooth and streamlined it has a beautiful feel and convenient to just slip in your pocket so just adds to the portability of it it supports DSD and it's super high-res it runs up to 384 kilohertz 24-bit and it has about 9 hours battery life taking about four hours to charge a time and this one is $4.99 so to round it up I really enjoy the color fly c4 for the nostalgic feel it's a bit reminiscent when you're using it the features the buttons kind of reminds you of things you might have used previously in the past when you're a few years ago but I really enjoyed that I enjoy the process of using it in terms of sound quality it's amazing and obviously you have that adjustable bitrate as well so ideal for your preference and quite variable as well the high five man and this one's the heaviest out of the four and but that adds to the quality adds the feel of how well-built it is well and really sleek nice to touch and I really enjoy the the jogwheel but it does slightly slow down your selecting process so and again it's all about process then the acoustic research I would say it's the lightest and the sleekest out of the four really modern and I really enjoy that about it really easy to just slip into your pocket very portable and like the Pheo x7 as well brand new just on the market and it has they look modern look really sleek obviously they have the internet-based services you can download tidal and flutter fly so really convenient quick and easy to use a bit like your phone you can swipe to unlock them so for me I really enjoy the Pheo x7 great sound quality really easy to use and just swipe to unlock bit like your phone so you know I'm just used to using products like that so I really enjoy that overall I'd say the high five man and the color fighting for they're all about enjoying the process all about taking your time to use them and and sit back and enjoy them I'd say the Pheo x7 and acoustic research are really if you're really on the go you want something really possible and you want to use it really snappy then and for me I would choose the Pheo x7 really enjoyed them all but absolutely brilliant product thank you for watching please do hit the subscribe button if you're not already a subscriber and we'll see you again soon with loads more videos

then using another phone in my case here an LG v40 has a remote control for that endpoint and one of my key prerequisites for doing that video was that the LG v 30 gives us a touchscreen so this is a streamer and network streamer with a touchscreen and that's important so those of you who came back and said well I can do this with my chromecast Audio or I can do it with a Raspberry Pi yes you can but it doesn't have a touch screen while the Raspberry Pi does have a touch screen option but I don't think it's quite as nice as this touch screen anyway that video was I was actually very surprised by how many people responded to it in the comments section very favorably but also it threw up a lot of questions and in some cases some issues that I would like to tackle today the first issue is that some of you I believe are experiencing some odd pops and clicks from roon running on the V 30 and then outputting from it's three and a half minute put here now I've not experienced that myself but you should know that my LG v 30 is some international version and for some reason it's not updatable to android 8.0 I think this is stuck on Android 7 so that may be a reason why there is a thread on the roon community forums about the pops and clicks issues so if you have that I don't really know what to say to you to help you fix that and it's probably cold comfort when I tell you that with the v40 those issues for me don't present at all Spotify everything's perfect with both these phones so also in last week's video we use this V 30 to play some sister mercy mqa from tidal and you might recall that I was a bit confused as to why there was some bit-depth conversion going from 24 to 16 and we can also see that on the v40 here because obviously this is a remote control for that and I think that's because for everything but the native tidal app the output of this headphone socket is restricted to a maximum of a 16-bit 48 kilohertz we can go to the tidal app we can pull up this same album in mqa it will say masters in the tidal app and we have to trust that that is playing higher than 16 48 out of the headphone socket but generally for all other apps roon included for Spotify is not an issue but for roon when we're playing high res it is this is capped at 16 48 so here we have the system merci playing an mqa on the tidal app on the V 30 phone now the thing is is in the context of it being a networked streamer we can't so easily remote control the tidal app with this there's no kind of like direct connection between a tidal app on here and on here so we'd have to find a more generic remote control app for this phone to remote control this phone which is kind of it's not a very elegant solution those it happens to exist you can Google for them just Google for like Android remote control app they'll come up but that limitation also applies to other apps so when people ask about or what about Amazon HD now I don't yet run Amazon HD I could pull up the Amazon app here but again we have that remote control limitation we need to use it more generic remote controller for that but then if we're in the Amazon app and we're playing 2496 out of that or even 24 48 we still hit the 1648 limitation of this because it's not playing from the tidal app so we need to think about maybe bringing in an external duck [Music] so you can see that I've added an audio quest dragonfly Cobalt to this situation connected by USB using a dragon tail to the phone the smart observers of you will notice this is the LGV 40 not the 30 the 30 battery died just had to put it on charge not all Android phones push ones and zeros out of the USB socket here many of them do but not all of them and the v40 does that anyway so I've got Sisters of Mercy playing again it's coming out through the cobalt deck here but you'll notice this light is blue and I'm playing mqa and it should be mqa purple and it's not that blue indicates 48 kilohertz rune doesn't tell us what sample rate is coming out of here but the dragonfly does so we're getting 1648 again so it seems that again outside of the tidal app we are capped at 1648 so if we want to get more than 1648 out of an Android device like this or if we want to avoid its resampling up sampling nonsense outside of the tidal app we have to pull up another app and this is called hey audio player Pro and it's not just an app it's also a USB driver so this app has taken over control of the USB port on this phone and you can see I'm running an mqa file here this is underworlds drift series it's very good and this is a 2496 file and you can also see from the cobalt we have got MQ a purple in play so no resampling no up sampling this is proper mq a proper high res from a smartphone into the cobalt DAC which does the decoding and then out of this cable and into my Hegel amplifier speakers oh that's quite a convoluted process really isn't any way but this this app is great it's really cool there is a fee with it I think is it 10 bucks 15 bucks not sure but anyway because I've owned this for years like absolutely yes I've forgotten how much I paid for it but a lot of people use this it's a great way to ensure that you don't have any of the Android nonsense getting in the way of you getting your mqa or your high res or whatever you want and I guess I should add because people are asking you this is like how does the Cobalt how does it analog output compare with that of the phone which is on this 340 is down here yep the Cobalt sounds better than the phone it's a bit more spacious it's a bit area it's a bit more easeful if you want something a bit more energetic though I all recommend going back to the dragonfly red very different flavours but as this is a phone and if you want to get really nerdy about electrical noise the cobalt is the only dragonfly to have some of the jitterbug technology built in but really that's I would say the discussion about electrical noise even though it's a high-end audio concern generally I don't want that to detract from the message of just having a nice simple setup like this of course there is a limitation to this setup again we can't remote control this app unless we go and get another remote control app a generic remote control app for Android phone so I could go and get my V 30 from the kitchen again put a remote control app on that an Android one and just control this but it's not very elegant [Music] so for those of you are confused a little bit as to what's going on here USB audio player Pro is the app that I'm running but it also supports tidal which is how I could play underworld and now I'm playing the system mercy again so it's the same tidal stream of the same system mercy greatest hits album and it's MQA we've got MQ a purple light on the dragonfly so we have everything in Scituate apart from remote control ability so let's recap so far I wanted to get an LG phone as a network streamer with a touchscreen firing directly into my Hagel amplifier down here and the problem is we can go to the tidal app but we can't really remote control into that as easily as we can with roon same with the USB audio player Pro it does a brilliant job of integrating tidal and qobuz and playing high res but for that we need an external DAC we don't have to use an LG phone then we can use any Android phone with a USB output but there are so many like swings and roundabouts so many different possibilities if this what about this let's try that I got to say normally I'm a fan of Android for many things especially for Bluetooth but for this kind of setup it's a bit of a pain in the ass especially if we want to do high rares I mean one do high rates probably and especially one do mqa properly so [Music] I've taken the Android phone away I've connected the dragonfly cobalt to an old iPad this iPad it's like five years older I can't remember what model it is and I'm using the Apple lightning adapter so I've got another touchscreen streaming set up here but this time using the Cobalt remember the cobalt sells for the same amount 300 bucks as an LG V 30 although I think you can get there be 30 a bit less some people have said you can get it for 180 or 175 but anyway instead of spending your money on an lg phone you could buy a dragonfly cobalt like this hook it into an old iPad now the reason I like the cobalt solution is that it's led here tells us what is going on with the sample rate coming out of the iPads lightning port here so here I'm using Spotify I'm playing future sound of London Papua New Guinea translations which is great and it tells me that coming out of the iPad is 44 point 1 kilohertz because it's green we need to keep an eye on that light because it tells us what's coming out of the iPad now if I cut over to Arun and let's say I play this is David Bowie's five years box set this is the tidal version this isn't ordinarily available if you play it through an mqa DAC you'll get 24 192 so I'll be the first one fall to 96 second and fold to 192 I click play here and think like this see look 192 24-bit now you can tell here that all we're getting is 24 96 from Brune it's doing the first unfold and here is the 96 kilohertz light on the Cobalt so when we get that kind of light blue we know that 96 kilohertz is coming out so that means we're not getting the full nqi experience because the light's not mqa purple on the cobalt it's this kind of frosty blue which means we're getting 96 so we're getting half of the mqa experience and this high res business is really complicated isn't it I'm listening to myself going oh it's just 24 96 this one 92 and blah blah blah blah blah I'm sorry if this is has become very technical it wasn't my original plan my original plan was just to talk about the iPad today but because of the fallout of what happened with the LG phone I thought I should address those issues first anyway here we are on the iPad 2496 now I'm very confident I know that the the rhone app here is just doing the first unfold because if we don't come out of this so we closed Bowie and we go to my library here and go to overview I save this this is a mqa version of the latest Richie Hawtin live album click play now get our info light and this is getting the first unfold from 40 41 to 88.2 and we know that's true because dragonfly gives us its yellow light which means 88.2 so we're getting the first unfold from the roon remote app on the iPad here at least it's not capped at 16 48 I think this is a very elegant solution because we can then go back on to the phone that I've just freed and I can use I picked the right zone if I go to my iPad now I can remote control this Richie Hawtin album [Music] so this Flaming Lips album is stored on my hard drive on my rune server and it's 2496 that's what rune tells me tells me just here and I'm playing it and the dragonfly cobalt also gives me its 96 kilohertz light so again it works for normal high res so if we go into the focus settings here of roon go all the way across go to format will take off 96 will engage 88.2 and now I have all the eighty eight point two albums in my library not many let's click on Depeche Mode music for the masses play now and you can see cobalt yellow 88.2 confirmation as well I've just said this is a real wormhole that many people can dive down so firstly in our wormhole confusing for the newcomer to MQ a high res is that there are two versions of this David Bowie boxer see the mqa logo here now I know this one is the 24 192 this one is a 2496 version so click on that if I click play as we've done before and we get mqa light here on the dragonfly now so far we've not seen that light on the iPad so if I disconnect it so this is the same 24 192 mqa version of the Bowie five years box set as viewed through a rune click play and you can see as before we have the 96 kilohertz light on the Cobalt you might be asking yourself why isn't it the mqa purple light that we had over on our Android device that because we need to tell rune that our Dragonfly see it says no mqa support here we need to tell it that it can do mqa and it can actually do decoding and rendering that means unfolding and some deck wizardry click Save now we click play again now watch the light change mqa purple and if we click the signal path you can see that it says NQ a studio 192 kilohertz so this is the complete mqa experience with the cobalt and I think all up this wormhole is very confusing for newcomers but let's not lose sight of the bigger picture here I have deployed an old iPad to use it as a network streamer with a touchscreen the touch screen is important I've connect to the dragonfly cobalt to it so that's my whole setup here and then I can remote control it from the couch using my phone and like last week's video I can also do that with Spotify let's not forget about Spotify for me it's very important there's stuff on Spotify I don't find anywhere else so between Rouen and Spotify they're the two key streaming things that I use in my life I have them covered on this rig so for me this is probably a slightly more reliable setup than with the LG phone and by more reliable I mean we don't have to kind of go well what about this happened am i getting clicks and pops or should I use a USB DAC tidal masters but all of those things I mean you can do those if you want and if you've got a good handle on those more power to you but really when I was starting doing these videos last week I wanted these to be more beginner accessible this one has not become that so I'm hoping if you've actually got all the way to the end here you will see actually this is quite we'll set up yeah I think we should stop there I was gonna say if you liked this video please like it down below I don't know whether it's any good if you think it's okay please give it a like please if you like my attitude towards well it's not really towards anything it's my attitude I'm not a big high-res user I'm really not I'm very happy with red book and CD quality I love this as a setup we've been running this for the last hour or so hour and a bit filming when I started filming the battery life on this iPad was at 91% this has been plugged in the entire time and now it's at 89% so please don't for a moment think that this DAC is going to drain your battery within half an hour or even now or even two hours it's not you can run this for many hours of listening and then use any phone to remote-control it anyway something I'm rambling again if you like this kind of thing if you think that this is something you could do with your gear so with your tablet or phone then please subscribe to this channel and as always thank you ever so much for watching

33,8xotaf4aN_g,HT Guys,UCEnAjFSVfU0ITPjk34XHK3Q,Hi Res Audio VS CD,In this video I try to show the difference between 24 bit 96Khz audio vs 16 bit 44.1KHz audio. There is also a demonstration of the ABX application which can be used for doing blind listening tests.,28,81138,278.0,809.0,109.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8xotaf4aN_g/hqdefault.jpg,High-resolution Audio|HT Guys|96K vs 44.1K,2020-10-07 10:14:18.934146," hi everyone this is our third area of the HT guys and today we're going to take a look at comparing high resolution audio to CD quality audio and we will do that in two parts the first part will be analytical we'll look at waveforms and and then look at the output of combining waveforms and that kind of stuff then the second part will be subjective and I'll show you how you can do a blind test with your own audio and you come to your own conclusions so for this test I went to HD tracks comm and they it's a website that sells high-resolution audio and if you sign up for an account you can download a sample pack and they use that to do these tests that we're going to talk about here for yourself so we'll close our Safari and then we'll bring up the audio C HD tracks so really buried in it okay so we're using another country by Cassandra Wilson and it's a 24-bit file 96 kilohertz sample rate and we will open this up with our application Amadeus Pro alright so there you can see the waveform this is the entire track a lot of dynamic range in this and later on I'll show you some audio that more modern audio that is very loud and doesn't have a lot of dynamic range we'll talk about that a little bit as you can see again 96 kilohertz sample rate 24-bit so what we're going to do is take this and we're going to make a copy of this but we're going to turn that into 16-bit and we're going to resample that 244 one which is CD quality and we'll call this 16-bit and the reason I like doing it this way is if you compare some of the songs on the HD track they website they may be remastered and so if you compare those to the CD quality discs that you may have you might not you might like the HD track more because of it was remastered so I think a fair comparison is take that version and then do the resampling like we did here and then what I'm going to do is open up the 16 bit since most of us deal with CDs and and then we rip the CDs to mp3 or AAC and I'm going to take that and we're going to make an AAC version of this but we're going to do 256 kilobits per second to AAC and you can choose to do a c3 if you want and this we're going to use in the second part of the test but we're just going to make that right now alright so now what we're going to do is we're going to open up the 24-bit and we're going to use audacity in audacity has I think better editing tools than Amadeus Pro which is why we why I music that alright so here we have 96 kilohertz and what I'm going to do is change this to 24-bit and that'll be done in just a second alright so we'll play and you can kind of get a feel for it I mean you're not going to really get any quality out of it but you can that's the so that's the music all right now what I'm going to do is take the exact same file and I'm going to make put that in here in audacity and we're also going to change this a 24 bit all right so we got 24-bit 96k low hertz and they're the identical files one of the things I'm going to do is invert the first track so whatever was up is now down and what was down is now up and what I'm hoping to see here is that I get an absolute perfect cancellation and see I brought up this website here this this picture you could look at the this is a waveform and this is a waveform that's 90 degrees out of phase if you sum the two together you get a straight line so theoretically the same should hold true for this audio file because it's an exact replication so we will select this and then go to effects and do invert and what will happen is you'll see it when that's done it just kind of shifts a little there we go up is down and down is up so now when I hit play I should hear nothing and as you can see here in the in the meters there's nothing coming across left and right alright now what I'm going to do is I'm going to export this file and we're going to do uncompressed file and we're just going to use the AIFF 24-bit PCM and we are going to say this is 24-bit versus 24-bit so and the reason I'm doing that is audacity actually has a spectrum analyzer which we can show us the resultant file here alright so now we will close this guy out and we will put in the 16-bit version of this and so there we got 44 one 16-bit and compared to the 24-bit remember this is still inverted so when I hit play if these files were exact you wouldn't see anything but what you'll find is that there is something because the files aren't exact and it's very low inaudible you can't hear it I've got the volume maxed out and there's no sound coming from the speakers all right so we will stop that and now what we'll do is we will export this audio and we'll call it 16-bit vs. sorry 24-bit versus 16-bit all right so I'm going to close this guy out and then I'll invert this file again just to bring us back to the original and then I had some more modern music and I just going to put it in there obviously not to do a comparison as far as like the inverting but so you can just kind of see here's a track that has a lot of dynamic range and here's one that I believe I just put in there don't you worry by Swedish House Mafia and you know what I kind of like that song it's got a great beat to it but it's very loud there's really no dynamic range so this is kind of some of the modern stuff that we listen to that I don't know that you know all this stuff about this high-resolution audio would even help this because it's just loud and then I'll bring in another track this is it's time imagine dragons and I I really like this song too again look at look at how the the waveform just goes max and you know they say this song up at the top this Cassandra Wilson song breathe this one doesn't give you a chance to breathe and then finally I'll put in another song by melody guard oh it's called worrisome heart and you could see how this song breathes so part of this discussion when I get into the subjective remember these these images in your head because that'll kind of help explain why some people like the high-resolution audio because if they listen to this type of material that's where they think that you're going to get the most bang for your buck but I have some thoughts on that as well alright so we'll close out audacity and again we're going to bring up the 24-bit original one and Amadeus Pro all right so again that's what it looks like and what I'm going to do here is bring up the real-time spectrum analyzer and it's set at a internal microphone so you can see my voice is way down in the low end here and we'll set this up to the scale go all the way up to 20,000 Hertz and then we will switch it to the current document so now when I hit play on this I'll lower the volume so that doesn't over and so this is what it looks like in the spectrum analyzer and what we'll do is I'll crank up the scale so it's a little more obvious all right so we'll close that out and then we'll bring up the 24-bit versus 24-bit and this is the one that because it was the exact file it should just be a absolute straight line because it should 100% cancel out and that is exactly what we see here I'll hit play on this and obviously we'll get no sound I'll switch over to the spectrum analyzer and select 24 verses 24 and there is nothing actually let me do stereo so you can see all right exactly as we expected and we'll close out of that we switch back over to my microphone here all right let's bring up the 24-bit versus 16-bit now this one whoops I open that with iTunes that's not what I wanted I want to open this with Amadeus Pro and here you can see a very slight sound wave there and we're going to hit play and again it's still not audible we'll switch over to the 24 verses 16 and here it is this is where the audio is that that's being that that's the difference it's around the 14 kilohertz up to 20 kilohertz and very low if I switch back over to this and then switch over to spectrum analyzer and select that all right that's what it looks like normally so you can see what you're missing is just a tiny bit and so some thoughts on that sorry I'm kind of getting all over the place all right so some thoughts on that depending on your age this is it right around the area where you stop hearing these frequencies for I've tested here in the house with tones through my system and I can hear about 15 to 16 kilohertz if I make it really loud and at that point my daughters are plugging their ears because it's excruciating for them beyond that I can't hear anything and this is where most of that is being deleted or or not represented in the in the CD quality version of this so I'll leave it to you to decide from a math point of view it's uh it's infinitesimal and for most people the people who can afford anyway the high-end audio you're not going to be able to hear it you just as you get older you can't hear these frequencies so from that point of view I claim that CD quality is good enough if you can hear the difference congratulations I'll never say nobody can hear the difference because every time I've ever done that in my life I've been proven wrong so I will say many people won't hear the difference if you can hear the difference congratulations also condolences because it's it's a gift and it could be a curse too because if you spend your time picking out these details I also think there are times you don't really actually sit back and just relax and enjoy the music because you think you're missing something but anyway that's there I showed you how to do this test you can there's other software packages on the Apple and the Windows platforms that you can do it for yourself and test that out so now with that we're going to go to the second part of this experiment and this is the purely subjective part and this is where you get to let your ear decide whether you think it's worth it or not to spend the money on high-resolution audio there's a package called ABX and let's see you bring up a website you can get it at less sing lacinato comm and the it's available in Linux Mac and Windows so regardless of what platform you're running you'll be able to launch this application and do your own a be test and that is exactly what this application does so we will bring it up here and launch it what you do is you could take your audio that you want to compare then you just drop it into these two areas so what I'm going to do is compare 16-bit AAC versus the 24-bit AI f so uncompressed versus compressed oh by the way just one thing I did want to point out if you look at the original file it's a hundred and forty eight point three megabytes and the CD version is forty-seven megabytes if you just go with what we talked about before you can see mathematically there's not much of a difference if infant a small amount and you save one third the space on your hard drive and if you got the unlimited hard drive and not unlimited viously if you got a lot of hard drive space maybe you don't care and that's fine but you can get more audio in this CD format but just for fun if you look at the AAC version it's 8.2 megabytes so a considerable difference in size quality in size a quantity sorry alright so what you do in the ABX application is you launch it you put your two files in there and you do start shootout and what this will do what the application will do is just randomly put the files in different order and you hit play and the audio will play will lower that and then you listen to the other one and you kind of go back and forth and then you choose one and then you can go to the next shootout and you go through the whole process again we'll choose this one a cool feature is let's say there is a passage in the audio that you really want to focus on you think that's where you're going to see the difference for for whatever reason you can set it to the beginning and end of a loop and then you can hit play and it'll it'll just loop between those points and you can kind of go back and forth without having to worry about listening to the whole song to get to the point where you want and we're going to choose so I didn't do next shootout so now let's do that alright so when it's all done you've done you know ten or fifteen times you do show results and just randomly I've chosen a two times and B one time a was the 24-bit audio and B was the 16-bit AAC file that's how you do the test and I think a lot of people are quite surprised at at the results I did to test myself and I compared the 16-bit AAC versus the 24-bit I picked the 24-bit 70% of the time and you know statisticians will tell you that's still not conclusive and I'll even tell you that if three times out of ten I couldn't pick the difference then you know it's not there could be some bit of luck involved in that I think if you really claim you can hear the difference you need to be able to pick it out ten times out of ten or fifteen times out of fifteen another thing that I thought was interesting was that there were aspects or parts of the audio that I would focus in on like maybe the symbols or something that's a little bit lower frequency and then the symbols to see how long it took before they faded out I found myself listening at the music and not to the music in this a B test and that's not a very enjoyable way to listen to the music but I guess for purposes of trying to hear the difference I guess that works however I think a lot of people get caught up in that and they don't get they don't sit back and really just enjoy the music so that's just something that was a personal observation on my part you may have the same thing or not what I ended up doing was having about I think it was 13 people run this test my daughter's some friends associates at work and two of those people claimed to be audio files for whatever that means they were able to hear the difference between the 24-bit audio and the 16-bit AAC about the same amount of time as I would so you could argue that yeah most of the time they heard it but not conclusive the remaining remaining you know 12 people or 11 people could not hear it statistically any difference between 24-bit and 16-bit AAC so for them it's definitely not worth it the cost and the cost of the equipment and that's a good point - we were losing using Bowers &amp; Wilkins p5 headphones and the audio engine digital converter and a price for that I think was about $200 or maybe it's $2.99 and the headphones are about $500 so anywhere between six to eight hundred dollars worth of equipment not the highest end but definitely we're not talking in here you know your blood type of headphones running just through the the headphone jack on a computer your mileage will vary obviously with the equipment that you have but I think the equipment that we were using for this test was higher and than most of the people who participated in the test have I think it was a good baseline and again if you need more expensive equipment than that to hear the difference you might argue is it worth it at that point but anyway the results were when we did the 24-bit versus a 16-bit nobody out of the 12 or 13 people who ran this test could hear the difference in any statistical mean meaningful way what that tells me is that a lot of people again what I said earlier and the part one many people will not be able to hear the difference and for those people it's definitely not worth it if you can't hear the difference again I'll say congratulations and it's a curse I guess because you're always striving to get the absolute last drop out of it and it's one of those things where you spend a lot of money to get incremental returns and you again can decide whether it's worth it or not but I would really like it if listeners out there would go and do this test themselves and send us an email and let us know how you did and I think it will we'll have a discussion on this and we'll revisit it over time as people start feeding back their results with that that's a that's the video I hope you found it informative and

10:14:18.934226, alright guys so today we're not actually talking about headphones but we are talking about something that is geared towards headphones this is the Pheo m9 and if you are familiar with vio at all they basically make like DAC amps and portable amps for your headphones used to be where you would plug them in kind of as the mediator between your phone and your headphones well this is a digital audio player that basically has everything in here so you don't actually have to have an external amp it's built into the player itself so the first thing you're probably wondering is well if I have a cell phone and I have bluetooth headphones why do I need something like this you don't necessarily need something like this but if you are really really serious about your audio and you want the best possible sound that you can get out of them that's where this comes in it eliminates needing the phone but you can still use bluetooth and you can use wired now I promise you this is not a review this is just not a normal type of device that I would review so I'm gonna leave out all the detailed specs and stuff like that that a lot of real Tru audio files are going to look for or pick apart this video is more for a casual audio listener that really just wants more out of their audio somebody that doesn't know all of the terms and stuff like that but just wants to know okay my phone is not giving me the best audio I think that I can possibly get how do I fix that and that is where the Pheo m9 comes in yes I know it looks like an mp3 just a portable player technically that's what it is but it is doing so much more than that Theo found a way now they've made these before but this is more of a newer revamp version that's giving you a giving you touchscreen controls it's got an aluminum body it's like really really well built and it comes with a silicone case already so you already have a case to keep this thing protected it is built for portability but it is built to give you way more out of your audio than what your phone and other devices are going to do it is high res audio certified and it plays every Bluetooth format you could possibly think of so like with the martial monitor headphones these are capable of playing Qualcomm apdex HD and so the Pheo m9 is capable of pushing that to that device in a much better way than what other phones like the pixel of three XL it's capable of playing all the Bluetooth audio formats as well but it doesn't play it in the same way that this thing can play so first off let's kind of take a quick look at the Pheo m9 so you kind of get an idea of what the look of it is the feel of it is it's very small it really is about the size of your hand it's a little smaller than that definitely smaller than most of the modern-day cell phones the top and the right-hand side is just straight clean there's no buttons on the bottom it's USBC that's for charging but this thing but the Pheo m9 is also a USB DAC amp so if you want to plug your PC or your laptop and run your audio through this you can so it will boost your computer's sound as well now you can also run audio to it and then send a Bluetooth signal to your headphones so you can even get boosted Bluetooth sound to your device as well now the one thing I do want to point out is using the USB C connection if you're going to be watching movies or a lot of YouTube I notice there is a slight lag it's not anything you know like a huge gap but for people that are real real picky about having the audio lonna just just right for the vocals that might be something you want to know so if you're gonna watch movies and plan on using this thing I wouldn't use it for that this device is strictly for music and not really anything else now also next to the USB C connection on the bottom is a two and a half millimeter and a three and a half millimeter jack basically an output so you can plug your headphones into it around the edge of it you have a micro SD card slot now that is definitely important because this thing only has 2 gigs of storage built in so anybody with a music collection that's just not going to work especially if you use a music collection now this is capable of running Spotify and Amazon music they don't come pre-loaded on there you do have to look online to see how to sideload those apps it's really simple anybody can do it and that's how I mainly use it I mainly used it for Spotify even though I went out and I had flat files for Queen and Eminem and a bunch of different genres that I loaded onto here so that I can hear how its handling files on it itself because then I use feos music app and it gave me more control and EQ settings over the music that you know with using with Spotify that you don't get even though just using Spotify the volume level the clarity and they push in the mids and the vocals with a high end it makes a huge difference over everything else that I've used and then you have a volume wheel that is one of the most satisfying sounds to sit there and just click it clicks as you turn it I could sit there and just do that for a long time that doesn't mean anything to anybody else but it's really cool to sit there and listen to it so you're probably wondering who this thing is for you can be a die-hard music fan that likes to pick apart every little sound and this would be beneficial and then you could just be somebody that just wants more out of your music and it'll also do that as well now again if you're an audiophile you can sit there and play with all kind of settings and just get things just right so in a time where we are all kind of gearing towards using our phones for everything it's our cameras now it's our audio players it's our media storage like everything you possibly want your phone can do but it doesn't mean that it does it the best and so when you want more out of your audio that's where this comes in and I've enjoyed the hell out of using this thing it has done wonders for my music collection and again I still use Spotify I don't have to go download a bunch of lossless files to be able to really enjoy music you can still do it just off Spotify and off Amazon music and things that you're using already so does this thing have weaknesses yes the battery life on this thing could be a lot better it's only going to give you 10 hours of use but if you're somebody doesn't use it often it does have 45 days of standby time so if you throw in a bag and you forget about it for a couple of weeks and then you pick it up chances are it's still gonna have some battery life so that is a plus but if you're somebody that listens to music heavily know that you're gonna have to charge this thing every day or every two days and it's another thing to charge so that in itself is inconvenient now you can't use this as a media player device as far as movies and Netflix and TV shows and in anything like that but the Pheo amnon really is an audio device first and an audio device only that's all it focuses on but everything that does it does really well and like I said as far as sound if you're looking for something to just give you a huge boost in bass that's the one thing I would also say that this is not doing but if you just want better levels better volume levels better clarity better mid-range something that can kind of open up your sound a little bit that's where this thing excels so I think personally for $300 especially when people are spending 300 plus dollars for headphones it's worth also investing so that the three hundred and something dollars headphones you get you're getting more out of it as well now if you're also somebody that likes to have higher-end headphones that have higher impedance levels that just take more to push them more to drive them and that's also where they Pheo m9 comes in because most high-end audiophile style headphones aren't gonna work well on your phone it'll be very very quiet in fact most of the time you will feel like it's not even plugged in right so as great as the pixel 3 XL is and as great as it is as far as playing all the different Bluetooth audio formats it just doesn't come close to having something like this so again like I said this isn't a review of the Pheo m9 this is just a device that I think is incredible and I think as much as I enjoy music I know a lot of you guys do too this is something I just highly recommend so guys that is Myra but you're not even gonna call it a review of the Pheo Amnon thank you so much for checking out this video thank you guys so much for checking out all the other videos and as always guys make sure to stay tuned for more

41,QXjHl8e2vk8,Maarten Heilbron,UC5akMMbBLdJ1XxszpqraBrQ,Sony HAP-S1 hi-res audio hands on review,"Hands on review of the Sony Hi-Res HAP-S1 audio player and SS-HA3 speakers. I review both details of the functionality and of the sound quality. 
I'm not affiliated with Sony, who loaned me this equipment for review. More production details, particularly of the music and more detailed and specific comments on audio quality are available at my maartech.com blog.
Please subscribe, share and link if you enjoy my videos. I'm very interested in your comments and questions and reply to all.",28,71309,141.0,383.0,19.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QXjHl8e2vk8/hqdefault.jpg,Sony|HAP-S1|Hi-Res Audio|SS-HA3|music streamer,2020-10-07 10:14:18.934362," this is one of Sony's new high res audio players it's an audiophile grade to channel music player perhaps one plays a wide range of music file types from its internal hard drive or from an external USB Drive it has an amp to drive a pair of speakers like these also part of Sony's high res audio line you'd think they'd provide a slightly higher quality speakers let's start at the back where there are digital inputs optical and coax and output to a power amp if you need more than the included 40 watts per channel analog inputs a USB port for an external hard drive Ethernet and 2 speaker terminals you'll probably connect your home network using Wi-Fi the front panel features an 11 centimeter LCD display four buttons and two dials after power volume and play pause the remaining controls are used to navigate the menu primarily using the smaller dial turn to select and press to enter the included remote adds the ability to mute skip ahead and back which are not found on the front panel but that's missing the point this player is meant to be controlled with an app here's the iOS iPad version it's also available in phone sized version for iOS and Android this gorgeous app provides the easiest and most flexible way to browse your collection by genre artist album or track or search to find what you're looking for the sense me channels play tracks according to mood it's freakily good finding the single cut on an album that suits the selected style for my quirky Toronto centric music collection better than genius or shuffle its the playback feature I enjoyed the most you can create but not edit a playlist by selecting from your list of Tunes streaming services like our do and slacker are not supported the tuner radio service is I found and favorited my preferred stations sleep timers to the playoff after you nod off desktop apps for Windows and Mac's transfer music files to the players internal and external drives the drives also appear on the network so you can manage files directly if you prefer wireless isn't that fast so for first time setup I recommend the Ethernet connection and while all of these features and functions are great there are real reason to get the haps one or other Sony high res products is quality these players support audio resolutions that go way beyond mp3 FLAC or CD up to the rarefied air of DSD used for the discontinued super audio CD multi-channel format and beyond give an age for a weight you can judge the quality of a music file by size the benchmark is the CD CD files contains 16 samples 44,000 times per second usually called kilohertz high res files can go up to 24 samples at 192 kilohertz then there's DSD a different encoding method at 2.8 megahertz here's the tricky bit mp3 or similar files start a CD files with the same sampling rate but they're compressed to a fraction of the data on a CD which means information is lost high res generally means any file with a resolution higher than CD Sony recommends six online vendors but there are more most have a pretty limited selection and prices of high-res tracks are over $2 albums are over 20 frequently single tracks are not even available of course most of us are listening while multitasking on low bitrate systems with less than optimal speakers or headphones and I'm not the first person to say that mono is the new stereo in these days music is mixed by engineers who are doing a tremendous job of creating powerful mixes for these less than optimal listening conditions so unless you're listening critically you may not have noticed but if you have or want to hear what you have been missing this player can help open your ears sony includes a few high-res sample tracks to get you started I have a few cuts on six CDs that I take with me when I listen to systems and speakers unfortunately I was only able to find one of them Sabinas Cuba and Antonio for Tony's meet me in London in a format with a resolution higher than CD listening to the hundred ninety-two kilohertz super high def version left me satisfied both sonically and emotionally but I wasn't sure I'd heard anything new then I played the lossless 44 kilohertz version digitized from the CD suddenly the vocals felt can find the space limited the guitar less detailed however if I'd not just played the high-res version I may not have noticed I say that because the majority of my listening was from CDs digitized to compressed files listening critically my favorite albums and tracks sound far better than I'd expected considering the sampling rate maybe it's the speakers maybe it's Sony's digital sound enhancement engine which attempts to correct for the effects of digital compression I prefer natural unplugged style music to over amplified and intentionally distorted so for my music I look for a system that delivers pure and uncolored sound with a sonic range that reveals the full soundscape and that's what the haps 1 delivers from angelique kidjo to simone dinner Steen from Lyle Lovett to Bruce Springsteen this system surprised me with a wide dynamic range excellent stereo positioning superb clarity and tight percussion bass sounds natural but not extended I've posted my favorite listening tracks and more detailed notes on my blog I wish that there was a larger selection of high-res music available that it wasn't so expensive and that there was a store in this app to purchase it I wish the Wi-Fi was a little more reliable I wish the app had an alarm function I wish that the player supported a streaming service even if that's just Sony's music unlimited and I wish that there was a way that this could be used in a whole home service maybe with Bluetooth speakers as remotes in addition to this combo there are other high-res players with more or fewer features as well as other speakers in so his line the world of high res audio files isn't for everyone it's far from mainstream and overpopulated with well-meaning but opinionated self-styled experts where faith Trump's science and while the haps one does appeal to members of that community it's also a perfect device that covers the bases providing excellent sound from a wide variety of files for both serious and casual listening [Music]"

плеер,2020-10-07 10:14:18.934413," hello everyone and before we talk about some high quality sound you need to make out several concepts suddenly you do not know them and so dac digital-to-analog converter, simply put, the device that converts digital file from zeros and ones to analog sound that we already end up as a result, we hear through the speakers through the speakers or through the headphones of the DAC uses a certain algorithm where there is a sampling rate what is this when we see a strange figure of 44.1 kilohertz, it means that the signal measures forty four thousand one hundred times per second the higher the frequency, the more closely the digital signal matches analog simply put more measurements of oscillations every second also do not lose sight of factors such as the number of audio file battle firmware with own or my sound equalizer processing sound under its algorithms headphone impedance reproducible frequency but here everything is as simple as possible, slowly approaching the heart of the matter is a music player called not player and to be honest I would put five stars in google play just for the name but the app itself too really cool she is japanese if you try to find him then you will be thrown at Japanese google play and its price is 899 rubles, yes, it's expensive, but it's worth it if you are chasing sound quality for its work you need on android version 4 1 and above or a with seven and above is also the official website where you can download all this stuff and which languages ​​are indicated there officially supported but we have four pounds where mods are laid out with Russian translation, therefore, I recommend following the link in the description to this video and download there in Russian and everything will be the same as you see on the screen everyone is familiar with such players as poweramp with the aim of neutron jetaudio they all appeared many years ago on android to get a huge amount updates and they were brought to mind and they all have their own merits which they boast to each other but they all use an internal collider that is, they use what is incorporated by the manufacturer of your smartphone into your the firmware of the player that I will show you now works bypassing all these clips and completely does everything himself, thanks to which high res quality is achieved yes, I almost forgot what high res is when music is recorded files get huge size with a huge bitrate, you can clearly hear each the tool these files go through a huge software processing to improve sound quality to achieve specific goals like this was conceived by the sound engineer, but after which these files are compressed into different formats that already come to your smartphone or on disk or you are listening through some kind of streaming and after compression into the same, for example, mp3 with bitrate of 256 or 320 km per second absolutely everything huge is lost number of parts some cleanliness some instruments if you have heard music on professional equipment then you understand that the same trick may sound completely differently and due to the fact that not a player bypasses everything that is laid high res quality is achieved for manufacturers of your smartphone or tablet achieves the sound that was originally conceived by the sound engineer and what it was when recording this file this player has its own volume control this player does not have an equalizer and no viper will work on it and no beats audio x loud sound and so on, moreover, I can say that if you install this player and then try pick it up, then you get under the bow, you just have a phone endlessly reboot so if you're chasing meaty bass do you like to pull high frequencies or just pick the sound exactly like you if you want to sit for hours on the equalizer, then this is absolutely not your option, you can close this video and forget about this music player if you want just listen to high-quality sound exactly as it should be it was conceived without any software processing of your phone from your manufacturer no proprietary enhancers, then you know what to do download this application listen and you will not regret the simplest functionality that should be in any player here you can create favorite playlists can be viewed sorted by album and include what you like you can watch the track graph you on your device and here see in what quality with what sampling rate you have files on phone or tablet or view formats genres and artists as I already said there are no settings here, all you can do is enable or disable animation view information about the player itself import purchases from google play but in principle, this player has everything serious shortcomings due to the fact that there is no equalizer, you cannot listen to normal music downloaded hand trackers in mp3 with low quality with a low bitrate for example the same breaking benjamin sounds like a mess here of course, any poweramp and or analog will benefit from its software sound processing and improved the window if you download a flag format or something similar put it on your device and listen through this application or through the same poweramp and you will hear a huge difference in poweramp and when you increase bitrate the sound just becomes cleaner a little the volume is not a little cleaner and more and more nothing changes, that is, in fact, you may not even notice the difference because if you hear music through a non-player then you will hear every note each instrument will be able to distinguish instruments from each other and hear each detail of that track that you have heard for many years wrong music will be transformed and I don't even know how to describe in words what he heard I on my xiaomi mi a one with this regular player there is one more thing if you have a smartphone with a dedicated DAC, the sound will be simple space if you have any old smartphone that you have been using for several years, there is a high probability that you do not have Harris sound support is that you do not have a dedicated DAC but it will be built-in outdated will not export such sound quality and you will write to comments under this video that the application is shit it is expensive and in general, the author rolled down but before writing that and if you really have this android devices try to do the same only for more modern apparatus and listen if the sound there is shit then write negative comment maybe just a bear stepped in my ear and others hundreds of thousands of people who are delighted with this player and who love high-quality music they are all sorts of equalizer improvements in general player as simple as possible I recommend that you download it try try it out on yourself and then make some conclusions as you like better, thanks for watched this video I hope that it was interesting and useful for you and informative all good mood see you in the next video bye bye"

man HM 650 at $450 which utilizes the same Wolfson chip the replaceable amp card design of the - man is pretty sweet but I do prefer the Athlon current interface more then there's neil young's highly controversial pono player at $400 which fits so awkwardly into your pocket and doesn't sound nearly as good as the a k junior there's also the fiyo x5 at $350 which is a great value but has a less user-friendly interface and feels less premium and more bulky so essentially the a K juniors main selling point is that Ashland Curran clearly knows what they're doing with sound and is well known for making high res players that technology does trickle down to the a K junior which features that along with a super sleek form factor and very friendly user interface I really really wish that the a K junior supported Wi-Fi connectivity in addition to Bluetooth 4.0 because that would open up so many options so you definitely do get what you pay for and there's of course no comparison between the a K junior and the a k2 40 or 380 this is no substitute I think this is a great product for people who are just starting to get into high res because of the dual functionality of it being an external DAC as well as a superb standalone portable player I can also see this being a great toy for a K 240 or 380 owners who want a second more portable option or backup of course please keep in mind that you do not want to pair this with a pair of cheap earbuds or headphones and you definitely do need to invest in a decent pair of headphones as well as higher-quality music files in order to fully take advantage of the a K junior so please keep this in mind if this is going to be your first high res player that's it for my first impressions of the a K junior check below for information links to the a K junior and a link to my own personal channel I'll be doing an overview video of all the a slim current pieces so stay tuned for that as well let me know what your thoughts on the a que junior and high res players in general are in the comments section below thanks for watching

10:14:18.934497, [Music] hello there this is Ben for kick guru and today we're looking at the s 880 DB active speakers from Edifier a beautiful pair of bookshelf speakers with a huge number of inputs and high res audio certification let's take a look at all the features on offer today out of the box we have one active and one passive speaker an optical audio cable RCA two three-and-a-half millimeter cable RCA two RCA cable speaker connection cable USB cable power cable and a circular remote control this speaker se is not just designed to look and sound great with its stylish wooden exterior smooth overall finish and vast dynamic range but to also have practical features like Bluetooth the range of which covered the entirety of my house uninterrupted but your mileage may vary the right speaker identified by the display and infrared sensor on the front contains a built-in amplifier and all the connectors you could ever need for audio input control knobs to adjust treble and bass levels as well as a manual input selection knob that doubles up as a volume control all have nice smooth movement input selection is made by clicking the knob in and volume by turning left and right when trying out these speakers I left them in their factory default before adjusting them to my liking which was to keep the treble in place and to reduce the base slightly in addition to these there is an infrared remote control that allows you to change EQ modes volume audio source and standard audio controls for connected Bluetooth devices the left speaker the one with the Edifier logo is passive and accepts the audio signal from an output on the back of the right speaker the cable used to connect these together is very well reinforced and durable this is edifies first speaker set to be high res audio certified high res audio describes a digital audio father is better than CD quality due to compression CD and other digital formats are down sampled which means that the number of samples is reduced from the original reco which equals a loss in quality think of samples like megapixels on a camera the less megapixels there are the less to find the image would be it's the same with audio the less samples there are the less defined the audio will be this is something that has gradually improved with time the s 880 DB speakers are able to play these higher sampled files that give a much closer representation of the quality and clarity of the original recordings more information can be found in the kick guru article link below the top half of the speaker contains a titanium laminate tweeter 19 millimeters in diameter providing bright mid high to high range audio whilst on the bottom half there is a 3.75 inch metal diaphragm base unit bringing on punchy bass and strong mid-range tones without the vibrations that normally accompany these features even with a hand rested on the speaker while it was rather loud and playing a bass driven song I couldn't feel any vibrations when testing the speakers I tried it both directly input it from my PC a mobile phone as well as with my microphone preamp which is a Presonus audio box I won I was able to get a great volume without signs of distortion on playback there are four preset EQ modes monitor is meant to reproduce original and accurate sound almost like a pass-through of the original audio classic mode reproduces a classic HiFi sound with a lot of warmth and familiar tonal quality vocal mode highlights the vocals in the song and adds brightness to instrumental and orchestral pieces dynamic mode boosts the dynamic range of the audio adding a lot of volume and depth to the output I would love to be able to demonstrate the different EQ settings or audio in general from these speakers but it would be an unfair inaccurate representation of what these speakers are capable of due to audio compression and the difference between recorded versus the live sound in person so I shall try my best to describe my experience with these speakers the range and quality of the speakers is immense especially in comparison with my previous speakers not only was I able to hear the massive dynamic range but could clearly hear that there was no muddy to any of the mid-range frequencies with low and high frequencies also performing well even at such a compact size the speakers could easily fill the room with sound whilst carrying the clarity of the audio as well even when I was playing back audio from recording 70 plus years old under presets like dynamic and classic the original warmth of the recordings was really brought to life I could easily see these speakers being used as audio monitors or for production work in general as the monitor EQ mode works well in creating a clear accurate sound that is perfect for not only hearing your original recordings but also any adjustments you make while editing overall I can't find anything that I don't love about these speakers from how they look sound everything having the built-in amplifier is a huge boost for saving space and there is only the tiniest amount of background hiss when switched on even at loud volumes it's the ultimate merge between consumer convenience and audiophile features easily appealing to anyone looking for a fantastic new set of speakers for a price that seems very reasonable for all the features and

mountain audio|nyc audio show,2020-10-07 10:14:18.934573, today we're gonna talk about the Cambridge Audio CX and V 2 music streamer alongside the qobuz music streaming service what's up guys I'm Shane and welcome to the channel if it's your first time here we discuss new audio and video products like this audio streamer as well as media content like 4k blu-rays you can consider subscribing for new weekly videos so I reached out to the folks at Cambridge Audio and I said hey I need something affordable the stream high-res music with great audio quality so they sent me over the CX env2 as the name would imply this is the second iteration of the CX and news extreme where that came out a few years prior biggest difference between the two would be an upgraded processor and chromecast Audio built in I'm also pairing the Cambridge up with koba's which is a music streaming service like title they have a huge library of high-resolution tracks which I think would be a perfect match for any cxn koba's can stream at up to 24 bit 192 k so having chromecast built into the Cambridge which will play back at 24 96 what allow me to stream at the best quality using chromecast now before we dig into the video let's get this thing unboxed and set up unfortunately they sent me an on retail package so I can't do a proper unboxing but we'll go over some of the included accessories that I think would come with the retail package inside you get a cloth bag containing the power cord a Wi-Fi dongle batteries the remote control and RCA cable and the Quick Start Guide the cxn v 2 retails for $900 it's your standard 17 inches wide by three point four inches high by 12.2 inches deep it's got a nice build quality but I wouldn't say it feels exactly premium I believe they have more premium offerings in their higher-end line up on the front of the brushed aluminum fascia starting from left to right is the power button the USB input a 4.3 inch color LCD display flanked by control buttons and a rotary knob on the right that can be used for menu selection or as a volume control if you're using this as a preamp around back is the power input two USB inputs one for the Wi-Fi dongle and the other for USB storage there's an Ethernet input in both inputs and outputs for optical and coaxial there's another USB audio in control bus for compatible devices balanced XLR s and unbalanced RCA pre outs what cool thing is that the labels are printed upside down so if you need to get behind it from up top the labels will be right side up that's a nice little touch now if you want to use this as a preamp you can set that up through the devices front display for listening purposes I've got this going directly into an nad m17 v2 preamp processor powered by rote LT channel amp I know the NAD has a surround sound pre pro but it's got some two channel audio chops I'll also be listening through a pair of Martin Logan PSL X electrostatic speakers if you want to check out those reviews I'll leave the link for all the equipment at the end of the video so setup is rather straightforward after power up just choose your network and enter your password once it's connected you'll have to finish the setup by going to the website you'll probably have to do a firmware update but that only takes a couple of minutes after that you're up and running as far as performance I thought it sounded like a great piece of high-end gear considering the price of $900 it's not exactly cheap but not exactly in the highest end of the spectrum either but for the quality of sound puts out I find you're getting what you're paying for I'm not gonna go into detail explaining what a live concerto sounds like because I'm just not into that kind of stuff but I did play a mixture of Dave Matthews Band some Diana Krall a little bit of pop a little bit of rap music you know biggie Eminem and going directly from the Cambridge into the nad I got that nice Airy wide soundstage I did switch back and forth using the Cambridge as a preamp straight into the amplifier and yes it sounded good but it was missing that extra depth it was a little more enclosed feeling by small margin I was playing a song from Diana Krall and there was some cymbals in the background kind of in the front between the left speaker in the center if I was using the Cambridge alone some of that sparkly high-end that you hear with cymbals it just wasn't quite there when I went back to the NAD those crispy sparkly highs when it came back now I'm not saying I dislike using the cxn a strictly a preamp because it does have a smooth presentation with a very musical mid-range but if you really want to get the most this I do feel that using a dedicated preamp couldn't get you some better sound quality now everyone said it will most likely be different so depending on what you're pairing this with you could get wildly different results than mine plus everyone hears differently right okay that being said if you're hard pressed on hearing that differences between a high-res 2496 case stream and a lower res 320k stream if you're using the qobuz app with the cambridge you can quickly switch quality options on the fly as I mentioned before koba's has a lot of high res offerings but using the app there wasn't a dedicated high res section you can stream for whatever album you're looking for and if there's a high resolution version you'll see that logo next to the title otherwise you can sort by genre and new releases and some qobuz recommended playlists they of course had some of the titles that I searched for and some that weren't after watching that Netflix movie the dirt felt compelled to listen to some Motley Crue but I came up with some karaoke versions instead but I mean the only started the service a couple months ago in the US and they keep adding new stuff all the time but what is available in the high-res format is what makes this service so great you can stream to the cambridge with airplay or chromecast but if you're using airplay you're capped at 16 bit 48 k if you're using chromecast you can max out a 96 K so chromecast will get you better quality and there was clearly a difference between streaming at 320 K and 96 now if you're not the type of person that uses subscription-based services that you can open up the Cambridge connect app and search your local network library the cxn will stream from your network or from local storage out up to 24 bit 192 if you're playing back through the USB inputs your files will be up converted to a 24-bit 384 K format using polynomial curve filtering interpolation how that works I have no idea this is done by Cambridge's own method they call a tf2 up sampling technology it gets up sampled and then goes through dual Wolfson WM 8740 Dex ok back to the app once you open the app whatever is on your shared network should pop up on the main page just pick your library and find your music it'll be sorted into different categories if you pick album then a list of your music will pop up alphabetically with cover art if you don't like the ListView then jump into the settings and you can select grid view now pick a song and you'll get title and bitrate information along with playback controls you can also go down to the menu and select from a number of internet radio stations if you have anything connected to the cxn you can select its input here as well there is a Settings menu where you can enable local device streaming adding your title account which I don't have you can change chromecast settings adjust your audio balance turn on the control bus to other compatible products and you can clear the cache now besides using the app you can access your library from the unit itself just tap the home button and you can access all your settings or go to the library if you've got a huge list then you can control the scrolling speed by turning the knob faster the slower you turn the knob the slower the scroll so final thoughts it's a music streamer I know a lot of you may have receivers with a lot of this functionality already built in but I don't think this is really geared towards those folks if you're building music only system and you already have a CD player a turntable a great to channel preamp and you want to step up into the world of digital screening I think this is a solid choice you can stream from your local network or you can attach an external drive with all your music on it navigation is a breeze from both on screen display and from the app it's a very versatile piece of kit you can use it with a preamp or use it as a standalone straight to your amplifier it sounds great and it's easy to use pair that with koba's and you've got yourself a suite high end high res music screaming solution so that's all I got for now let us know what you guys use to get your music fix on you guys stream you see these records or all the above if you're interested in any of these items I'll leave some links for them down below in the description thanks for watching don't forget to Like share and subscribe we'll see you guys again in the next video

dialogue the dialogue on analog music reproduction today in this video we're gonna discover all the truth on high resolution headphones let's take a look [Music] okay I think um there are few aspects that need to be discussed about high resolution headphones I'm not gonna go in depth or why are the best headphones the characteristics of that I just want to explain a few important aspects related to the high the so called high resolution headphones um we're gonna go through four main points in trying a little bit to understand better what are they how they should be constructed let's say and what to look for to effectively and truly achieve a high resolution reproduction playback and so you can enjoy that so let's start point number one what our high resolution headphones um surely high resolution headphones are not those that have the little yellow logo there's a lot tons of high-res headphones that do not have that so you don't have to look for that logo that's just something that Sony is using and other brands like that but um you did you don't have to look that necessarily I mean it's not required that's just something that marketing is using in order to pump push a little more certain brands in certain models um you just have to look at the specifications at the specs take a look at those of the headphones you're interested and you will understand immediately if the headphone is a high-resolution how it's very simple a high-resolution headphone must have a frequency range frequency response going at least all the way up to forty thousand Hertz or 40 kilohertz um usually normal equipment as you know goes reaches um it depends on the lower frequencies but listen it can go all the way down to five ten thirty it depends but what's important you have to look at the higher frequencies and those usually commonly go to 20 kilo Hertz we explored here's a link to the video in depth what is all this discussing discussion all this fuss around higher resolution on not a high resolution actually but what can the human ear hear why it's important to go above those frequency response why I have these little guys on my loudspeakers so take a look at this video and you and you will have a little more info on this aspect but turning back to our headphones as I said you don't have to look to the logo you just have to look to the specifications and a lot of head phones already surpass um the the standard cutoff of 20 kilohertz which unfortunately a lot of digital stuff like all CDs are cut off in that at that frequency um as you can see up there I also have a pair of audio technica the 880 m50x which are which are excellent headphones and those reach 28 8 kilohertz while instead what I'm wearing here is a fantastic pair of - he5 6 oh and this instead reach the frequency response and the frequency range they extend all the way up to 50 kilohertz which is well up above the the limit of high res which is as I said 40 kilohertz so this is already a first important point let's pass to our second point okay so this is a very important aspect and not it's connected to the high five to the headphones but in general - general reproduction of high resolution so you're interested in high resolution you're looking for some good headphones okay but the first thing to do is to look for high resolution material because it's um if you have a high quality headphone a high resolution headphone don't come don't come mix up the two things high quality is something considering the materials the the cables the the the geometry of the thing high res is what is that apart from the frequency response capable of reaching of the headphones high res is the high resolution of the music signal that you want to listen to um there's a lot of issues there there is a huge problem there because there is a lot UNH's hundreds of high so-called high resolution audio which is it's just a converted normal signal even from analog high-quality analog or digital boosted up to 96 kilohertz or 192 kilohertz by 24 32 bits and so on even even higher um or using DSD also that's a completely different snot PCM it's a completely different technology and in that case as well sometimes they just get old sources old material and converted that's not gonna work I mean you're just doping the signal um it may be a little better but that's that's not true high res absolutely then if you analyze those files they're not gonna reach the 30 40 50 kilohertz absolutely not you must obviously look for native hi-res music otherwise it's it's pointless what do I mean I mean that you the true high resolution music through my resolution files if you listen to digital or a good quality tape obviously must be first of all recorded in high resolution and I don't I don't mean just the recorder not just the recorder has to be capable of receiving a 40 50 60 whatever kilo Hertz signal for the different bits but it also needs high resolution with a extended frequency response microphones I mean that's something nobody says if you're not using a high frequency response of microphones you're never gonna have that frequency response you're never gonna have that high resolution so that's fundamental and obviously that type of equipment wasn't present in the old days 60 1780s so all those reissues and transfers of high resolution unfortunately are not gonna be true high res they're excellent transpositions I mean if you want to have an excellent a digital copy of an analog tape for example go for not 192 kilohertz per 24 bits it's good even a standard CD will will be good sometimes as well I mean it really depends but that's absolutely not gonna be high resolution audio so this brings us to our third point very important point so after we discuss about the headphones itself and the signal um remember that from the music reproduction the source to the headphones there's something in the middle what's that the amplifier oh yes if you do not have a capable amplifier of dealing with a high frequency response signal you're obviously gonna downgrade that music signal so it's pointless to have something like this so if you wanna achieve listen to a true high resolution music signal you need obviously a good pair of hair phones which is capable of doing that the signal but also an amplifier ahead amplifier which usually are sometimes integrated in your stereo etc they're not gonna reach that you need a standalone amplifier look at the specifications and you have to see the frequency response if the frequency response goes above 20 reaching 30 40 50 as we said at least 40 to be in the higher res domain then that's good then you have the full line high res then your you will be able to enjoy that type of music but otherwise it's just a matter of marketing and just fooling around I mean this is not being said by the big companies and I think that's that's something that it's worth mentioning to inform people so the last point I just wanted to mention is do not use even if they say it's high res do not use Bluetooth or wireless headphones the trend now is Bluetooth which is probably better than what other than Wi-Fi signal but that's never gonna be a high resolution audio signal at least not in the majority of cases why where it's very simple first of all you're using a wireless interconnect interconnection connection which is very most probably it's gonna be influenced by interference when you're walking around the city or wherever you are that's degrade the sound already second of all we're gonna use digital a digital signal because Bluetooth is digital in that sense you're already having a compression also of that signal which is gonna be sent to the hair phones and then the signal is gonna be converted in inside the the headphones meaning that the converter it usually it's not gonna be that high-quality it's already inside the headphones so as you can see the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signal isn't that good forget about that solution well guys I hope you enjoyed this brief video please subscribe to my channel leave your comments leave us some indications of good quality headphones do you think we should all know the headphone community and hope to see you soon bye guys you

and down and this is the multifunction button you can change that we're looking to the certain to see and I'll show you how you can change that one there also you have two screen protectors and folks you do need a screen protector because it's a fingerprint magnet this display here and then you have the manuals here manuals here and then you have the charging cable I see now this is the player itself I've had a little listen to it I've had a little play with it still not familiar with all the functions on here on the left hand side as you can see the the note icon there opening that up that shows you what I'm playing at the moment and playing a bit of George Benson and going into that going to the let's have a look right by the way the wheel the wheel that's the scroll wheel is not too bad and you can go into the settings and change the sensitivity of the wheel but so far so good I like it it's not it's not doesn't jump all over the place I'm not gonna for he would like I said I had an x3 before but I had the first-generation one which I really liked it was a nice warm sound now let's go into the settings let's go into the settings right just trying to get back to where we started from right that's the icon now that is your that shows you the album playing now the second one is shows you all the categories the album the artists onra favorites playlist and all on what have you now to do that when you put your SD card a that's the SD card slot there once you do that once you put your SD card in you have to update the library I haven't updated the library I'm just what I'm doing I'm using going straight into the folder section here there's a folder section there and putting straight to the folders that should get my music out idea that's all I'm doing and I'm not using the light I'm not using the library but if you update the library that you can use all the generous in the second category which is this one here now that's the folder category there as to brother folder we get out there this is actually player settings and the player settings you have the play mode zoom mode play gap playback gap playback gap I mean that that probably means gapless playback anyway max volume default volume your gain your high gain I'm using it on a high gain right now because I am I'm using my trusty b.o.b I know play page six second generation very good headphones and there's your balance and your playful folders also I'm doing right now as long as you can see some planing for the folders this is for your Marcus it's for your multifunction button yeah that button is for your multifunction button there which is this one here this is what sort of player here that's the multifunction button that's the volume up and down that's the power button here that the power button I thought this lit up but it's not a light printed right on there that's all it is let me show you what else is on the player I forgot to do that right the bottom you have your 3.5 mm socket head pool socket there and so it does develops as a line out as well and you've got your USB charger USB charging port there you've got the balance headphone I think that's a 2.5 millimeter socket in there I haven't tried that yet cuz I'm got a balanced headphones I don't know how that sounds and on the player itself you've got the back button you've got this one here which is the I think this is the let me see that I think that shows you what's actually play let's have a look at that and if you press that burn or it comes out with these little sub moves on top here if you press this one here it comes up with these little sub minis on there so you can put your favorites on the I don't if you can see it you put your favorites on there just shuffle you add a playlist delete from here which is not bad and I like it you can play back several times as well it's not bad it's not bad the little function you're like I like that there that's the pause button I've just pressed here and let's get out there so that's that one there sort of a little submenu on top where you can add all your other favorites know your shops and all that right and that's it and settings let's go into the actual settings itself the actual settings you have you that's what you can update your library the media lab your music library haven't done it or you can change that too also if you want to there you go so far so good the screw scroll with is okay like I said the player is a fingerprint magnet so you will need your screen protector on here just your Bluetooth settings your key lock settings screen time now and the rest of it you can see their ideal sleep + sleep timer and USB molding the rest of it and that's just a quick showing of the player itself and of it you've got the iris logo you've got the rest of the other details there and on the sides you've got these like I showed you earlier there you go you got the volume up power button it's called the motion function button and so you can set that to do other things as well and nothing on the other side playing build quality is quite good actually this is stuff that to be a metal frame and this is plastic here it's plastic this is not glass this is plastic as well I think this is plastic as well and you've got all the settings on them all the settings on there as well so that's that's that's it and you've got the blue light here that denotes when a player is on and that's about it so far that sound wise I've had a little brief listen to it it's a smooth warm sound not overly aggressive he thinks Eames to be balanced that's what he said balanced and it is balanced everything to be you haven't got aggressive bids or aggressive bass or aggressive treble everything seems to be a balance that's usually that equalizer everything seems to be in a balanced sound so you can use the settings if I show you the settings in the you can use the settings to change the sound as the change the sound the way you want it but I don't like using this I don't like using the equalizer equalizer in here so am I using it but there's the equalizer there and there is and you can change it whichever way you want black it says it's balanced it's a smooth warm sound and the bass is alright I wouldn't say it goes really really low but but it's okay it's there please the music is detailed enough for you to enjoy the enjoy listening to it but like it says it's a ballad sound I think it said something when it is marketing nothing comes stands out the trouble doesn't stand out this this doesn't stand out mrs. Stanner just balanced everything is he cool I don't I'm not a review of apps but that's just what comes out that's what it sounds to my ears just balance sounds and it's quite good I do like it'd be great for it's great for jazz and classical and we'll have you dub music you might have to change the settings in the in equalizer to do that but I don't talk too much now I just wanted to show you guys what the player look like and and thank you very much for watching bye
56,Vc8Hb4kBUdM,Bikram Shrestha,UCL5mAhtgOkyyyUQVHmFAYuA,Sony NW-A45 Review,"This is a review of the Sony NW-A45 after couple of week of use. This device is really good for some one who wants to invest in seperate high res audio player instead of playing file in the mobile device. 
Short over view is that 
1) The physical key has really good tactile feel.
2) The User Interface is easy to get used to and has easy access to common features.
3) DAC feature is a bonus and shows the audio output level and sample rate.
4) Language Study has quiet unique feature that allow to repeat within a audio file in a loop.
6) Battery life is really good and will last more than 20 hours of playback if you are playing Hi Res and CD quality sound.

Downside.
1) Bluetooth need to be paired again while switching devices.
2) Proprietary usb cable 
3) Syncing Software takes forever to analyse the songs and get missing information.",24,45045,60.0,91.0,223.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vc8Hb4kBUdM/hqdefault.jpg,NW-A45|Sony|Walkman|Sony Walkman|Sony Walkman NW-A45|NW A45|A45,2020-10-07 10:14:19.267820, hi guys um we're in this honey and oval-8 45 series both men after a couple of week of youth there are a couple of things that I really like and something that left me desiring for more the thing let's start with the thing that I really like obviously it's gonna be the physical keys as you can see sony has provided lots of tactile CD could keep to live with a swing with the power key and that doubles as a slinky and then we have put up for the new record key and then we have got labels and skip and backward next track and backward and we have put a hold key if you are familiar with a 30 series walkman then and there is only a couple of things that are different and and if you look at Sony's website the only difference that I can see it is and the user could redesign and new folder technique that I use for products amenities of Walkman series and this thing is out of the box you get aptX support in 40 series while you need to get a software update in a 30 series to get aptX support right now I mean software version 1.1 but it was 1.70 when I and on what this device and after a bit and that then that I found was it supported where are you now eat her added aptX SDF funds which was missing earlier and the next thing that I like about this wok mine is the you are you will get used to DC UI within a couple of day of use or maybe within an hour is so simple and you will be greeted with the menu boy which was different option to assess yourself and men Walkman from fun like FM radio the language learning and the next thing is user interface as you can see it's quite neat and it one of these shows the information that you need so in this case you can see the song name hmmm and obviously the artwork Chris Webb we will go to the main user interface we salsa on the feature of just what my people that it was so other songs that is already the playlist power in a selection right it will so the book map let's go back in if we strap down it will show all option that is available for customization if you had word NFC enabled device is a very easy to peer in this client see those other debris reverse is now just disconnected and Experian and this language study feature is quite a good feature which allow you to slow down the speed of the speeds they did me stand over them or make it faster as well as skips five-second return back through second back or ten second as well as you can mock vice setting a starting and end and beat that thing again and again in a loop the deficit is quite unique now let me try with my PC I'm having some difficulty with my back as you can see it shows the current level of awkward as well as they determine that is really used add a VLS enable earlier so now I can increase phone up to 120 let's talk about the thing I really didn't enjoy you have to appear with device every time you want opponent I mean if you want to connect with different device then you have to appear every time somebody isn't buying this device for as i'm from sanh ality then you will be disappointed the sensitivity of the FM receiver is not that strong but if errantry guess then yeah obviously they're after officer that Sony's forwarding is great but all say is not that much useful in location where I'm at the moment the software provided by Sony have to sing the music which is called Music Center is very very slow in processing the song so that sense made Fisher can work once adaptive between analysis is finished then only you'll be able to different and it will automatically categorize the songs that's the good thing and Tom said is the software is really lagging and take forever to finish analyzing all the songs and sometimes if you do that analyzing thing it just take forever and sometime it will just alter the information that is embedded in the files and you will end up with something totally devoid names and our mod which is very would I would say really is why this Walkman the battery life is great although that it has got with their own propriety us be exact was I really hate having to carry n1 Accra okay but the way it sort high res audio is really good though I don't think everybody will be able to differentiate between the city quality and high res audio there's only couple of songs that I'm able to differentiate hopefully this will have some of your questions and help you in deciding whether to buy this new info t-series a Walkman or stick with your old f30 just stick with your mobile phone but I'll say you will find a quality difference if you are jumping from a mobile device and this is your first high res audio like me I've been using Samsung afraid and I can tell the Sun quality is different is way higher in my Walkman thanks for watching

10:14:19.267844, alright guys so today I want to tell you about an audio device that I feel once I've picked up and I've tried in so many different ways has improved my listening experience on pretty much every device that I have and so the device I want to tell you about is the Pheo m5 so the first thing you're probably wondering is what is this thing well technically it's an amp but it's a very small device it's got a two and a half inch touchscreen that's 240 about 240 pixels so it's not anything that's gonna blow you away as far as screen resolution goes but it's a small device that you're able to use as a high res wireless audio player or wired audio player for pretty much anything you can think of I've been able to use this on my laptop my desktop and using it Bluetooth through my phone it even has the micro SD card slot so if you have lossless files you can just put them in there directly and just have music stored on this independently there's just so many ways to use it now as far as the high res Bluetooth formats it pretty much supports any one of them that you could think of it supports SBC AAC apdex apdex HD and even Elda it does use USB C for charging which I really appreciate but the battery life is only 13 and a half hours now I personally think for a device that is this small and something that you're going to have to make sure that you keep charged as well I would have liked to have seen more battery life out of it now if you don't use it often it will get you around 22 days of standby time so it is nice to know that if you pick it up nine times out of ten you're gonna have some kind of battery life if you don't use it that often now one thing I didn't care for too much on this device is the interface it just kind of felt dated the swipe and touch controls sometimes felt like you had to just do it a couple of times over and over to actually register what you want it to do it just didn't feel as intuitive as most modern devices but the Bluetooth capabilities is what I think makes this worth it so let's just say around the house you're used to using Bluetooth headphones or earbuds or let's just say you have a perfect pair of wired headphones that you're just not really getting the most of out of your phone like your phone is only capable of so much audio output unless you have one of the LG series that has the deck and built in but what this is capable of doing is having your phone basically Bluetooth the audio wirelessly to the device so then you can plug in your favorite pair of headphones so that you're getting that amplified sound it is making a huge difference when it comes to volume you can get so much more volume by using this than you will your cell phone plugging in a pair of headphones that usually requires a lot more power usually something either you have to sit at your computer with an amp or if you plug into your phone and you're just getting barely enough volume I was able to really enjoy and get more than enough volume simply by plugging this in and just having it in my pants pocket so you can have your phone playing music straight to this device and walking around your house doing whatever you normally do and enjoy a pair of headphones that you can't normally enjoy on the go another thing that I did notice and one thing I was concerned about is once you start to get to higher volume levels you start to wonder if it's gonna cause Distortion now if you push it to the max and you maybe even have an EQ that you're using that's pushing the bass up some sometimes you can experience a little bit of distortion it's very rare and then you almost have to be to the point that you're pushing your ears to the limit of what they should be hearing anyway now as far as what it does to your audio it seems to be cleaning it up quite a bit like it's taking your bass and tightening it up while also bringing out a lot more detail and clarity in the treble I also notice that it started to bring out a lot more detail in the mids as well so vocals we're just straight out of my phone would normally sound a little bit veiled it felt like it had more presence with this amp now this is with using the EQ setting to off now it has eq's built in but they're all like preset EQ is you can't adjust it yourself like if you want to hear a little bit more of this and pull this out you just don't have that control so I think that's one thing they definitely missed on here now the USBC it does a little bit more than charging and one thing that I think has improved my listening experience on my laptop greatly the USB if you plug it into your desktop or your laptop and then run it in through here it then turn this into a DAC amp for your computer so where you're getting so so sound normally this is pushing and amplifying that sound as well so if you watch movies on your laptop or you just like to listen to music on your laptop on the go this is a much smaller device that you're able to enjoy and it's not taking up a lot of space it's not really hard to keep up with I mean it comes with this little plastic enclosure that you slide it in and it clips you can clip it to your shirt your pants pocket whatever it's really easy to keep up with now the m5 also has a step counter so you know if you're going out running walking working out the beauty of being able to throw an micro SD card in here and keep your own files you don't have to even have your phone so it's just very versatile it's nice that it keeps up with a step counter although I don't need anything else to do that it has a nice microphone built-in if you're somebody that just occasionally likes to take notes or record what's going on around you it's nice that it has that so as far as cons the the things that I really think I would have liked to have seen done a little differently is the interface I wish was just easier to use it's kind of hard to get some of the things quickly as you want to they definitely should at least give you a custom EQ control or you can adjust things the way that you want to like most DAC amps do so overall the vom fob is very very impressive device it's a very versatile device and then you're able to enjoy audio in a way that you normally just can't with your phone or your laptop or anything so this has been very nice to have it's very easy and convenient to keep on you and carry around overall it's just a very well-built device that has a lot of features but guys that is my review of the Pheo involve thank you so much for checking out this video thank you so much for checking out all the other videos and as always make sure to stay tuned for more

devices all look genuinely modern and with each iteration and generation we are seeing less build quality issues and less software issues their latest portable music player is called the m7 and what fire has attempted here is to make what appears to be a well made and built product at a reasonably modest price of around 260 dollars to some extent the design of the m7 is both new to fire whilst still drawing a few design cues from the x5 13 and x7 mark 2 in particular with reference to the volume dial but it's perhaps a more conservative design as it doesn't incorporate any extra edges and angles like we saw on those two higher priced models overall it sticks closer to a more traditional candy bar design aesthetically the m7 looks perhaps most like the ak1 20 mark 2 and a K 100 mark 2 from Estel and Kern this is especially true when we look at the position of the display usually we'd expect the biggest part of the bezel to be situated at the bottom edge of the display whereas for both of those [ __ ] and current devices and the m7 the largest bezel portion is situated above the display along the left hand side we'll get a set of play/pause and skip buttons as well as a volume down the volume dial seems practically identical to that of the x5 13 and x7 mark 2 although it does feel a bit more sturdy than the one on the x5 13 in terms of how much lateral play there is there's still a little bit of wiggle here but the actual clicks do feel more solid and tactile interestingly those playback buttons once again draw a stock resemblance to those found on the a k1 20 Mach 2 and a K 100 mark to the top edge is where we find the power button and 3.5 millimeter headphone jack the power button has the design as the ones found on the x5 third-gen and x7 mark 2 but just has a smaller diameter we still get the LED in the center to show the charging and power status of the device the left hand side houses nothing more than the micro SD card slot whereas the bottom edge is also reserved only for the USB type-c connector this is the first time that fire has incorporated a type-c connector in any of their devices and so I assume that this will be the new standard for them going forth of course this does mean that the current line of Doc's like the k5 and DK 1 are not compatible with the m7 so it'll be interesting to see what new accessories n Doc's fire will release for the updates at USB connection admittedly the design of the m7 can take some getting used to as I found myself on numerous occasions picking up the device upside down due to the unconventional placement of the display perhaps what also contributed to these moments of confusion is the fact that the headphone jack is also located along the top this is by no means a deal-breaker of course but just be aware that there might be a bit of a learning curve involved but overall I think fire did a really fine job the m7 definitely does not feel cheap or flimsy to me personally I would have liked to see just a bit more of a design flare like we've seen on the x5 13 and x7 mark 2 but again the more understated look of a m7 is not what I would consider to be a deal-breaker my main concern with regards to the design though is the position of the volume dial when we consider how it might affect the ability to stack the m7 to an external am poor deck if we were to use the regular old rubber band technique then this might put unwanted stress onto the volume down but fire dead recently announced a stacking kit which is specifically designed to be used with the q1 mark - and my guess would be that they'll create something similar to use with the q5 but I also do hope that they consider designing a more Universal solution as well perhaps something similar to what they've done with the x5 third-gen moving on to the user interface I've said it before and I'll say it again - a very large the UI can make or break a user's experience with the device and in the case of fire I've been extremely critical of their seemingly sell now fix later attitude but I'm also a big believer in giving credit where credit is due and when it comes to the m7 fire is well deserving of a pat on the back their previous devices often had such glaringly obvious flaws that it honestly left me wondering if anybody actually tests the UI before they shove the unit's out so really with the m7 I'm seeing a massive leap forward firstly let's deal with the look of the UI whilst the m7 runs a flavor of Android much like any of their other Android based players the difference here is that fire have gone to great lengths to strip and slim it down to only the bare essentials in essence what we are getting is a UI that operates very similarly to what you'd find on a nestled and Kern player it's clean minimal and focused something that is entirely appropriate for a dedicated portable music player starting wolf on the homescreen we have six main options to choose from namely fire music FM radio file management gallery technical support and settings the file management is simply a file Explorer type of app that will allow you to create folders or move delete or copy files on either the internal or external storage the technical support app is similar to what we've seen on files other Android based players and this is where you'll be able to execute firmware upgrades in addition to having access to a Quick Start Guide and a couple of fa Q's with regards to the firmware upgrade it should be noted that all upgrades ought to be done locally meaning that there is no option of OTA updates and this is purely because the m7 does not have Wi-Fi capabilities this leads us partly to what is perhaps the only real downside to the software on the m7 due to this slim then trimmed Android OS you cannot install any third-party apps this aspect will unfortunately be a deal-breaker for a number of people as I know there are specific music then many people would prefer to use over files own music app but I really should add that the file music app that's on the m7 is a bit different to the one that's found on the x5 13 and x7 Mach 2 they obviously do che numerous similarities but the one found on the m7 feels to me just a bit more refined and it looks and feels more closely related to the iOS version of the file music app however if we combine the inability to install third-party apps along with a lack of Wi-Fi this means that there is no possibility of being able to use streaming services like tidal or Spotify this too will unfortunately be another deal-breaker for many people another unfortunate reoccurrence comes in the form of replay gain or rather than lack thereof I don't quite understand why fire keeps omitting this feature despite the fact that it's one that's repeatedly asked for in the forum's this isn't anything Hardware related all that is needed is for fire to code it into their software so exactly why they still haven't included this feature well your guess is as good as mine I suppose but if you don't particularly care for replay gain or streaming services no have any specific preference to which music app you want to use then the slimline focused UI approach on the m7 is correct the thing I keep coming back to is that whilst the m7 isn't perhaps as feature-rich as I would have liked to see the maturity of the UI is the best I've seen so far from fire there was only one instance that I managed to repeatedly crash the system and that's when I inserted a 200 gigabytes and discard the problem here was not a capacity but what the m7 didn't like was the fat32 format that I had a card in so I simply copied all the music off of the card then reformatted it in expert and copied the music back on since changing the format of the card I've had no crashes while we're on the topic of external storage I've got to admit that I was surprised by the speed with which the m7 was able to scan the 200 gigabyte card and create the music library it took just over three minutes and 20 seconds for the device to scan through a about 6900 tracks which puts it on par with my own channeling m2s that's around 20% or so faster than the x-pyr 13 and x7 Mach 2 I suspect that maybe this increase in speed is not only due to the slimmed down OS but perhaps also due to the Exynos processor used despite the fact that the m7 has less ram then both the x5 13 and x7 mach 2 is the UI perfect no there are a couple of things here and there that I think can be improved upon as well as bugs that I found that need to get fixed but I honestly have not come across any flaws severe enough for me to even consider the UI to be crippled so let's have a look at what those flaws are and perhaps fire themselves could refer to this review in terms of identifying flaws and possible improvements to be made first up while the UI is overall pretty darn snappy and responsive there are a few little glitches here and there in terms of scrolling sometimes when scrolling through a list you can see that the display is struggling a little bit to keep up resulting in a few stutters I haven't been able to find any specific workaround for this but one tip I can give you in terms of speeding up the UI even more than what it is as standard is to employ an age-old Android trick if we head over into Settings General then about device and then tap on build number a few times this will enable developer options then when we head over into developer options and we scroll down the list a bit we will find three options called window animation scale transition animation scale and animate a duration scale if we set all three of these options to animation off this will result in a noticeable improvement in the UI speed of course if you like the eye candy of animations and transitions you could opt to simply put the setting at 0.5 times speed which will still give you a slight improvement while we are in the developer options I should also state that has standard fire guarantees stable USB audio output only to the q1 Mach 2 and cue 5 and so if you connect any other external USB audio device it will probably not work with the m7 but indeed developer options there is also an option called select USB configuration and if you go into that and select audio then the m7 will direct the audio to an external device the odd thing here is that the m7 actually uses more power doing this then if we were to play music on its own giving you only about half the total playback time compared to playing music solely on the m7 so obviously there is some sort of battery draining bug present here and that's probably why fire hasn't enabled this function as standard yet while we are talking about battery life we might as well quickly mention the overall battery life of the device testing this out with the pinnacle p1 as the load at volume 39 out of 60 and playing a number of 96 kilohertz 24-bit files I managed to get a total playback time of 16 hours and 37 minutes interestingly when doing the same test but outputting the signal to an external amp that only gave about an extra 5 minutes of battery life which is well within the margin of error as that's less than 1% improvement the battery life might not be as amazing as they claimed 50 hours you could get from the Kohen plain UD but compared to files other devices it's still very respectable ok getting back to the bugs another bug I found has to do with the search function of course a search function can be immensely helpful especially if we've got a very large music collection but the problem here is that let's say I want to search for Eric Clapton I then head into the search function and start typing in the name this will then bring up all results that match the phrase that I searched for including artist names album names and if that search phrase was found in the actual track names so in my case the result found when searching for Eric Clapton is the artist name and the Eric Clapton unplugged album here the problem comes in when selecting either of those two results as this leads to the device playing all music found under that category rather than simply going into that category if I click on the author's name I then want to see all that are listed under that name and likewise if I select the album I want to see the tracks that are contained on that album I'm not sure if this is in fact a software bug or if this comes down to this function not having been thought through properly now while we are looking at these search results let's touch on another bug we can see that on the far right of each result there is a little play icon I presume that the purpose of this icon would be to commence playing of all music associated with that search result however we can also see the same icons throughout all other category and directory lists as well but it doesn't always work if we browse through the music library via tags ie via artist or album categories then this works as expected but if we are browsing within the folder option that is to say the way the files are actually stored on the storage medium then this little play sometimes does not work at all to illustrate what I mean let me explain how I store and organize my library on the card in the root level of the card I have folders for each artist and then within each artist folder lives a folder for each album and then finally within each album folder are the individual tracks as well as the album art image so the problem encountered here is that if I'm looking at the artists folders and I click on the little play button then nothing happens but if I go into the artists folder and then click on the play button next to the album folder then it works as expected so clearly there's a bug with reference to dealing with multiple folder hierarchies that needs to be addressed by fire and then the final bug that I came across has to do with the lockscreen I don't know about you but I don't keep any sensitive information on my music players and so I don't particularly care to have a lock screen I'd much rather not have to swipe or slide anything around on the screen when I press that power button to wake the device up I want instant access to my music now of course this is entirely possible on Android but on the m7 turning off the screen lock seems to only affect the main home screen and so as soon as you start playing music you once again have to deal with a screen lock this isn't a bug after all perhaps this is something totally intended by fire but I personally would prefer if the lock screen is turned off entirely when I opted to have no lock screen okay so those are the bugs dealt with now let's have a little chat about specific improvements that I'd like to see the only thing that I found a bit frustrating with the UI of the music player app is that there's no quick way of getting back to the main home screen of the app fire did incorporate swiping gestures for jumping back in lists as well as jumping quickly to the main launch of the device but there's nothing to get you quickly to the home screen of the actual music app this problem becomes apparent when we consider the fact that all of these settings for the app can only be accessed from the apps home screen so what happens is that you'd have to continuously swipe back until you get to the apps home screen so my suggestion here would be that fire either figures out a way to get users to be able to quickly and easily jump to the apps home screen or create a slide down menu for some of the settings like you'd find on regular Android devices or another option would be to consolidate all settings within the main settings category so that you don't have a split between the app and the actual device settings now let's have a look at the connectivity one of these standout features of the m7 is its compatibility with numerous Bluetooth formats including AAC aptX HD and Sony's LDAP format I've got to admit that I was seriously impressed with the stability and range of the Bluetooth signal especially when compared to their previous devices I did face just a few little glitches when connecting to the Sony 1000 xm2 via the El deck format but this only happened once or twice and so was pretty solid for the vast majority of the time in the past I've been disappointed each and every time with the Bluetooth performance of files previous Bluetooth capable music players but the m7 has proven to perform really well in this regard as far as connectivity is concerned the only real issue I found has to do with the FM radio I personally don't particularly care for this function but those who do want to use it will likely be quite disappointed with the sound it just doesn't sound good at all as there's a fair amount of static presence indicating that this function either hasn't been implemented properly or there's some sort of software bug that still needs to be improved upon now finally let's talk about the sound quality of the m7 with reference to playing music stored on the internal storage or micro SD card I once again found that file did a great job in this apartment they were no obvious issues that stood out to me and in comparison to not only competing products from other manufacturers but compared to other products within files own lineup it's clear that the m7 sound will hardly disappoint anyone who listens to it the overall character I would describe as being quite neutral but very natural and organic at the same time it doesn't come across as a device that's trying so hard as to sound artificial by any means compared to the x3 Mark 3 while the m7 does cost a bit more than the x3 both devices are attempting to appeal to similar users then main differences here being that the x3 offers 2.5 millimeter balanced output and no touch display interface both devices are capable of outputting a digital signal but the x3 can only do so via a 3.5 millimeter coax connection whereas the m7 does so via the type C port in terms of sound I must admit that I favor the m7 here in comparison the x3 sounds a bit brighter and vocals somehow seem a bit more forward to some extent the x3 can sometimes come across as sounding slightly more detailed but that seemingly more forward treble often results in what I can only describe as sounding a bit more artificial at least when compared to the m7 anyways the positive of that slightly more forward treble can make the x3 also sound as though it has a slightly wider soundstage but overall I still prefer the more neutral and organic character of the m7 picking between these two devices will probably mostly come down to your needs in terms of whether or not you prefer a balanced connection as well as the fact that the x3 can deliver up to four times the amount of power that am Simon Gann if you prefer a slightly brighter sound character and don't particularly have a preference for a touch interface device then the x3 could be a good device to look at however if bluetooth performance is important to you then the m7 easily beats the x3 not just in terms of range but in terms of available Bluetooth formats as well another competing product would be the m2 s from Shandling comparing the sound of these two devices proved to be quite interesting because despite using a very different DAC trips I honestly don't know if I could tell these two apart from one another on the one hand I want to say that the m2 s sometimes comes across as perhaps being just a bit smoother than the m7 but I really could not pick up on anything concrete to distinguish one from the other of course on the m2 s we do get more than three times the available power output so there could be a significant factor depending on which headphones you prefer to use as a device despite being noticeably more bulky I prefer the touch interface of the m7 over the scrollwheel interface of the m2 s I'd still regard the m2 s as a wonderfully compact source device but for day-to-day usage combined with nearly double the battery life from the fire the m7 would be my pick for being the better of the two devices this is also true when considering Bluetooth performance the Bluetooth on the m2 s is pretty good but again just like in the case of the x3 the m7 is definitely a step ahead in both range stability and with reference to available Bluetooth formats so let's jump back to another one of files devices the x5 third gen this may seem like somewhat of an unfair comparison as the price tag of the x5 does sit at a little more than $100 above that of the m7 but I would argue that the m7 is the better of the two devices sure the x5 does offer a larger display dual card slots Wi-Fi connectivity third-party app supports a balanced output and up to six times more power on tap than what you get from the m7 but if you have no real need for any of those features the m7 feels like a much more complete device in terms of the design and responsiveness of the UI Bluetooth connectivity is also again in favor of the m7 but so is the sound quality to be honest I've not been a fan of the sound of the x5 as to me it comes across as being a bit too soft and undefined it's subtle but every time I compare it to other devices that's what I pick up on and I again found this to be true in comparison to the m7 no matter which music I listen to the m7 just comes across as being more competent retrieving details with better definition and so allowing for a greater sense of instrument separation once again if those extra bells and whistles of the x5 don't appeal to you the cheaper price point and overall better executed device that is the m7 would be my personal pick overall the value of the m7 is this I strongly feel that it marks a turning point for fire the fact that they've done such a good job with the software that Bluetooth connectivity and with the sound really does give me an immense sense of hope and excitement for their future devices the m7 is by no means a perfect device but taking into account what it was designed to be I honestly do consider it to be the most complete device to have left the fire factory of course we would always like to see a bit more bells and whistles and what will turn many people away from this device is perhaps the lack of power along with zero possibility of integrating with streaming services but again if you don't care for streaming services then the m7 could make complete sense to you where this lack of power will come into play would only really be with full sized headphones the 40 milli watts available at 32 M loads might not seem like much but it's still way more than what you need for the vast majority of IEM out there heck even the pinnacle p1 which is somewhat notoriously power-hungry is still perfectly driven by the m7 with plenty of room to spare so once again kudos to file for the great job on the software and they'll make a note of the bugs I listed as well as some of the possible improvements thanks for watching and I'll catch you in the next one Cheers

we're going to be talking about the con the con is one of the newest players from masculine Kern and it combines one of the best combinations of Technology features and price that we've seen on the market today when you first pick up the con the first thing you'll notice is it's hacked it's an inch thick and weighs over half a pound so compared to the average smartphone it's a beast considering it has a built-in amplifier it's actually pretty impressive that they said all of these components and just such a compact form factor the con is extremely well made something would come to expect from a spline curve the outer shell is a one-piece aluminum construction available in two colors astro silver and AOS flew the rear of the body is tapered and rigid making it easy to hold in your hand while previous excellent current models use a small wheel to adjust the volume they took a different approach with the comm there is a roller built into the unit it feels really intuitive and we actually prefer it over the previous design across the top you will find all the outputs including a standard 3.5 millimeter connections and a 2.5 millimeter connection for balanced headphones the power button is also on the top right side to turn on the con simply hold the button down until it powers up across the bottom there are two SD card slots one micro and one standard the con comes with 64 gigs of internal flash memory but the microsd supports it the 256 gigs and the standard SD can go up to 512 gigs the USB C input allows you to transfer your music it's also how you charge your device it only takes four hours to charge the con and you get 15 hours playback time micro USB audio digital output is also included this will allow you to connect to an even better deck but the native DAC is capable of 32-bit and 384 kilohertz is D playback going all the way up to 11 point 2 megahertz the con features a four inch touchscreen which displays the time of the day whether bluetooth is enabled Wi-Fi signal strength battery life as well as some other features there are also a few physical buttons along the bottom to skip tracks play and pause and go back to the home screen these days everyone has a smartphone with a touchscreen so whether you're an iPhone user and Android user or something else all together the interface for the a spline Kern should be easy enough for you to pick up with a minimal learning curve you can access the music a few different ways if you can connect the condor your computer the device will show up like any other external storage device moving music over is as simple as dragging and dropping folders and the menu structure is what you'd expect with artist album song etc you can also connect any music on your home network using the a K connect tab the con also has Wi-Fi built in and allows you to connect with streaming services including title move and Gruber's plus while this isn't the best selection of services we've seen it's a nice feature to have and more could be added at a later time with a simple software update now that we've talked features and functionality let's talk a little bit about performance as we mentioned earlier the con has a built-in ant that can drive even the most difficult high impedance headphones if it's struggling just make sure you have the balance high power modes enabled and you should be good to go we tried a bunch of different headphones of these we were even testing reviewing the folk alyre at the same time we were trying out the con these headphones aren't easy to drive but the con was able to get the most out of them which was impressive when we evaluate the performance of the con it all really comes down to what kind of performance you're looking for and what investment level you're willing to make sure there are some nice budget portables in the sub $500 range some of them are even from companies like a strolling Kern and fiyo but they don't have built-in power amps if you listen to the con with the right source material and headphones you'll definitely hear the difference on the other end of the spectrum the con fall short of higher-end players like a spelling turns on a kiiier T or the Sony n wwm onesie the timing isn't as good and the more expensive players do offer a better sense of space and detail the high and low end sounds but for under $1000 were very impressed the con is quickly becoming one of our best-selling portable players and the feedback from our customers has been really good so we've the feeling of this unit may go down as one of a slang terms best-selling products to date the con is available now on audio advice.com as well as a ton of other great portable music players and headphones to pair them with the

10:14:19.268028, Oh [Music] hi guys welcome back to Ana dialogue so what you just heard was a type 4 cassette a metal cassette made my Mac so fantastic very high quality incredible oxide recorded on a nakamichi dragon with Dolby B I bet that's good but the deck is not only the point the cassette is not sufficient you also need a good source and that song that you just heard was coming from one of my favorite Latin jazz albums which I've recently showed you in another video dedicated to DVD audio here's a link so now you heard it I hope so I hope you did from the from the microphone but you tomb is gonna compress anything so it's gonna be kind of hard to understand the quality of that cassette on the recording passed through the cassette so what's the point of this video the point is that we can make the best out of our digital sources but let's get more in depth more closer to this let's take a look ok guys I just want to say that at who has been following me for at least a year year and a half already knows that I did something similar a similar video but it was a race from YouTube unfortunately my fault so now I'm gonna do it again but I gonna do it in a better way enhanced version let's get to it ok so what am I trying to say is that if we have good quality cassettes we can also use something normal like a type one but I do not suggest that I do not recommend that we have to start using high quality type tool like this is a type 2 chrome consent by Sony uxs or the type for metal cassettes or as we did for our Anna dial dialog volume 1 mix here's the link if you don't know what this is which I recorded as you know on this metal cassette by sony Sony is not the best friend for medaka sets but it's decent so what can we do with cassettes and good quality audio digital audio so I'm sure a lot of you already know what am I what I'm about to say as you know also in the past a typical feature was that of recording your vinyl records or your CDs on the cassettes on cassettes because again I want to highlight this pre-recorded cassettes the one already bought from the shops with all the famous bands are not good you guys who does not know cassettes live lives in this ignorant unfortunately pre-recorded cassettes are pure crap only high-quality cassettes like this even a type one it just has to be a good quality cassette recorded you're by yourself on a good quality deck please pay attention to that you want a good quality tape thick then the results are gonna be from this they're gonna jump to this if we give them an excellent source we're gonna do amazing things in fact the best thing you can do is give a sense to our digital music our digital streaming is that of recording high resolution music not only that from super audio CDs or DVD audio which also come with DRM most of them you can't even send the digital signal out of your CD player if not HTMI with strange Dax and converters to difficult and it's not gonna not gonna work perfectly instead if we use our analog signal which the labels do not care anymore but we do we can use obviously starting from digital we have a conversion to and a digital an analog signal that analog signal is very precious prickly as it comes from a high-resolution resource a source I know it is digital music but once it converts its converted with a good DAC that's also a fundamental point in this process I am illustrating you then we can send that signal to our cassettes and have excellent quality cassettes what kinds of single singles very simple as I said not only are super audio CDs not only a DVD audios but also the fantastic streaming services that we have today so title yes you can do you can create an mqa cassette absolutely yes remember this one of you guys subscribe subscribers suggested this nests a climb fantastic it's an eighty eight point two kilo hertz sample and resolution by i think twenty four bits i downloaded it i put it on the cassette and it sounds amazing so you don't always have to be completely analog we can take the goodness from digital and transpose it to our cassettes which give that final analog touch but we're looking for cassettes are then parma are back in the game absolutely if the quality if you get a good tape deck and a good digital to analog converter a DAC then at that point it's better it's like vinyl a good quality vinyl turntable pre-performance reamp amplifier blah blah blah it's even better cassettes maybe get get even a higher quality in that that mean that obviously in this percentage in this correspondence plus if you have the time if you have the machines you can also put reel-to-reel tape on two cassettes at high speeds and get fantastic results but that's analog to analog we already know that I want to focus on digital so you so thanks to title we can have in streaming so you just need your subscription the title and shoot all the masters it's called masters you have to have a specific subscription to title which unlocks the masters which are mostly mqa encoded an mqa is a good thing in the end we will do another video more specifically even though a lot of people already done a lot of videos so you already know what mqa is in any case it's a loss the glossy or matte but it does deliver high quality especially when the origami when the file is completely unfolded and most of it the information is delivered but in order to have the full unfolding of mqa you need a specific digital to analog converter a specific deck in any case even if you don't have a specific DAC the masters the mqa files even if you download them because you don't have to do it streaming not necessarily are very high quality trust me I've been doing this without a specific um converter I also tried other converters like the meridian explorer 2 there are also other solutions that can be cheaper for example the one presented recently by project will also one that the a's award that's best DAC here's an image so if you adopt these solutions you can also unfurl mq8 but trust me it it's not that necessary I mean or you go on at a high-end DAC and then you will have great benefits otherwise better get a good very good but normal dak which will do the job at just as good so one that's one plus high resolution files you can download them you know how but apart from that you can also download them or stream them from your caboose subscription that's one of the main resources for high resolution audio but there are lots of other services or places where to download high resolution files and at that point you convert them with a good data you send them to your high quality deck and then at that point you're gonna have fantastic quality cassettes again cassettes are back in the game with that trust me guys so let's take a look at these streaming services how they how they work what kind of files are present so as you can see here we're set for our Mac or a computer and if you want to experience mqa as I said you're gonna need something that can and unfold the origami as you can see for example this portable DAC meridian explorer two high resolution audio and mqa which is directly connected to a USB port and then to a pair of headphones obviously a high quality DAC is gonna beat this no problem okay guys so um one thing I forgot to mention that it's important is that in order to play these high resolution formats it's better if you have a dedicated software not just a mmm simple player like I don't know booth vcl or something like that no it's better if you had something dedicated on Windows there's lots of extra excellent free software that is capable of doing this on the Mac is a little more difficult plus if you have something specific very high quality which also integrated mqa like for example on the Mac we have this fantastic how tear out your van and audirvana in an English way with this kind of software you disclose the full potential of your computer absolutely so this is also another key point I would say in the chain that we do need in order to obtain the maximum quality from our digital files and then convert them to analog for our cassettes so I just wanted to briefly show you these are the two main services as I said Co boos and as we go as we can see here we're already connected so for example we go here on discover I just selected here blues country folk but you can put anything you want and as you can see we have this yellow H next to a few albums which means that it's high resolution for example here we have the the last album free counters here and Allah on the right side you can see strange you can see that a few files have different high lower resolution than others so you can see this from here or the new album from the Black Keys not a very high sampling rate so you just need 48 now in order to to declare something high resolution audio but for me high resolution audio is starting at least at 88 in any case apart from that there's dozens of types of genres and as you can see even new releases which or old releases that have been converted hi resolution let's see for example this one from that Punk 88 not bad so Cobos is a little more traditional because it's just high-resolution audio instead with title as I said here we go I selected masters you need a dedicated subscription in order to have that as you can see next to each album here we have the little m or it's the Soundwave of the mqa logo so for example if i go here i have my meridian now explore to connected so if i click play and you're not gonna hear anything because i didn't connect the audio i just wanted to show you you're gonna see that the mqa logo here is gonna turn on first of all and it's not gonna be green it's gonna be blue because if it's blue it means it's the studio version which also means the last folding stage the best of the best it doesn't matter if the resolution is not that high for example as we saw already in caboose it was 48 and again even in this case it's 48 so it's the same file but in this case it's mqa not only it mqa as we said is a compression format lossy but it's also a certification of quality in fact Cobos did something similar again i'm sorry if i'm butchering these these men these darn names but you know I'm Italian so I did I do mispronounced a few of these in any case with Cobos um if you when you when you start your subscription it does say in a certain place in certain point they date they do only accept high-quality albums files directly from the producers from the labels I know that's just their declaration but I do believe them I think that they are doing as much as they can in order to have genuine files not just high-quality rips from a CD conversions like that like a lot of people did in the past no even Kobo's is doing something similar to mqa is trying to certify his high-resolution albums and when you hear them I must say that they're pretty close in some cases don't ask me why I don't know why even though it's lossy I do feel that mqa masters not always but in most cases has a little extra oomph little extra quality the bass is a little more deep and I don't know I just tend to prefer a little bit and if you think about it title is a little more cheap than in terms of Euro cobos is 25 if you want to have high-res title if you want to have access to the Masters is 19 if you're not a student etc just normal standard so already that's that's another point for for title but they're both excellent plus Kobo's has much more classical in jazz music well title is a little more pop rock so you also have to decide something in that case for DSD unfortunately we have to go in other other solutions you have to download mainly the files because they're huge as you can imagine so you have to go on specific files like native DSD okay so for example here this is one of the most famous sites where we have native DSD where you have true DSD albums also true DSD recordings which are very few guys remember the 'i want DSD as less converted as possible because DSD we're gonna let me do a video on this does it is in many cases converted to PCM in order to edit it so we don't want that then it's might as well go with PCM but we'll get back to this this was just to show you that for DSD you usually have to UM download stuff I'm sure their streaming services I'm not aware of for DSD although the files are huge so maybe there aren't you tell me guys maybe you're more expert on that okay okay guys so I hope you liked this suggestion I'm sure a lot of you have been already been doing this please let me know in the comments please let me know on any other resources in streaming or in download that you think are worth mentioning here I may I may add it in the video description in order all the community can enjoy it in order to obtain high-quality cassettes again please remember the three fundamentals high quality tapes high quality tape tech high quality Dax in order to convert the digital signal obviously the part of them the main starting point we could add in the fourth point is the source we need high quality high resolution audio or MQA or something similar like that which means starting from 48 I would say at least eighty eight point two kilo Hertz sampling rate and 24 bits upwards all the way up to 192 sampling rate and 24 bits or 32 bits or even more it's very rare or if you want also another fantastic option is to put the SD yes guys you can also stream DSD obviously to your cassettes and you'll have DSD cassettes mqa cassettes high resolution cassettes and you won't regret it I mean 100% they're gonna sound as good as the source or even better with that analog warmth that we all love ok guys that's it so remember apart from anything that music is born Alec

This is what I think the first hands on video worldwide of the Onkyo DP-CMX1 Hi-Res Audio Smartphone, shot at CES 2017!

The device features two DACs from ESS and dedicated amps for an absolute premium audio experience, featuring two headphone jacks, but also has a 5.0 inch 1080p IPS display, a Snapdragon 808 hexacore SoC from Qualcomm, 3GB RAM and 128 GB Flash storage, a 16 MP rear camera and an 8 MP front-facing camera.",28,38995,22.0,177.0,13.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K7jTMVy_Y6k/hqdefault.jpg,Onkyo DP-CMX1|Hi-Res Audio|Smartphone|phone|Hands-on|Hand on|review|test|CES 2017|DAC|Dual DAC|ESS Audio|hexacore|Android|Marshmallow,2020-10-07 10:14:19.268093, hey I'm rolling and I'm here at CES 2017 and this is the last video from the show floor this is the onkyo dpcm x1 so this is the japanese super high-end audio smartphone or audio player with smartphone capabilities depending on what you want to call it that has launched in japan or has been announced in japan a little while ago they're finally showing it off here in CES 2017 so i'm taking a chance to take it first very quick and dirty hands on look at it and if you look at it closely you'll see yes this is one massive break of a device but it is also catering to a very certain niche of customers so they're taking this metal body that is actually really good-looking for being this Square and heavy but it really feels super premium and it has a bunch of very special features on here so at first we have this 5 inch full HD panel on the front that is running at 12 1920 by 1080 pixels resolution it's an IPS screen so viewing angles are very much decent color reproduction and contrast are also pretty good I would say under the hood we have the Snapdragon 808 hexa-core SOC that's running at up to 1.8 gigahertz combining those four on projects 853 course with me to our ARM Cortex a 72 cores that are for more taxing jobs that the CPU has to take care of also we have an 8 megapixel front-facing camera right here plus your earpiece in the typical sensor array for distance and the brightness management or ambient light on the side here you'll see there you go there says high resolution audio so this is mainly made for audio audio files down here this is pretty much a blank space so yeah because they're using those on-screen buttons right here it is running a very highly customized operating system but I'll talk about in a second apart from that you get three gigs of RAM and 128 gigabytes gigabytes of internal flash storage there's also a micro SD card slot down on the right side where you can insert a memory card that goes up to 128 gigabytes and taking a quick look around I'm sweating a bit so the device and gets a bit dirty right now you'll have this job dial up here that only not only lets you navigate through lists but also you can change the volume on the device on the back you get a 16 megapixel camera right here plus your dual LED flash the whole thing is made out of a very heavy feeling and premium feeling black metal design you have these big and panel bands up here to separate the different antennas for Wi-Fi and LTE going over to the right you'll have this notification switch up here so you can turn off notification when you are listening to music to just be by yourself and totally zone out we have the power button up here down here our dedicated music controls so you can skip songs and press play and pause down here is where your SIM card goes this actually has two SIM card slots plus a microSD card slot going further down to the bottom you'll have your single speakers but that speaker isn't really important there's a microUSB port down here that charges the battery of a capacity that I actually know right now and at the top you'll have two audio jacks two three and a half minutes actually one two and 1/2 and 1/3 and 1/2 millimeter headset jack plus the noise cancelling mic and there's also an infrared blaster to control Pioneer art Onkyo audio equipment with it going into the software we'll look at the about phone screen for a second there it says Android 6.0 point one though it's still running marshmallow on here but it has the November security patch but looking at the audio stuff right now this is looking at the folders I'm going to just quickly get some kind of music down here mqa comparison and it's play this so you have a dedicated audio player it has its own equalizer a bunch of audio controls on here you can set different you can individualize your audio settings you can turn on and off the equalizer here for example plus you get a selection of useful apps for audio files in this case Spotify these are titled plus all the other there's an equaliser software in here plus a control app to control Pioneer devices with it so yeah that's been just a very quick look and before I can forget the most important important part this thing has to ESS saber es 1918 k2 MDA season here plus a bunch of amps that should make sure that there's an absolutely awesome all your experience on this device it also supports 384 kilohertz 24-bit audio so there should be no problem having a lot of fun with this device listening to music there's one thing that you want to know that I can't actually tell you which is the price its sister model which is the dedicated audio player without the smartphone part is available for a hundred eight hundred US dollars so this will at least cost a thousand dollars once it comes to the US I don't know about launches in other countries but we'll see about that later so that's just a very quick look at the onkyo dpcm x1 here at CES 2017

here and in today's video I'm gonna be doing a simple unboxing and introduction to this new DAP player that I have so for those of you guys that don't know a DAP is a digital audio player so this one is my fale and it is the m7 model and as a disclaimer feild did send this tap out to me to review so this video was not sponsored I just got a free unit for me to do a review on in case you guys were interested in checking this out for yourself I'll drop a link to their Amazon listing for this product in the description below and right off the bat this staff does sound pretty good and I will be using it in my upcoming earphone review videos so basically any time I'm testing out an earphone I will be using this step now starting first with the unboxing as you can tell this box has quite a few impressive certification logos on it so first of all at the top right corner you have the high res audio logo at the bottom right you have L DAC as well as Qualcomm aptX HD and I believe this also supports DSD now opening up the box you have the dap in all its glory it's a pretty sturdy piece it doesn't feel light or hollow like you would imagine it actually has some nice heft to it let's go ahead and turn this on now and see that interface so while this is turning on let me speak about some of the specs so I believe inside you have the Exynos chip which is made by Samsung it's an ARM based CPU chip as you can see in the bottom of the device you have a USB type-c on the left side of the device you have a one scroll wheel and a total of three buttons the scroll wheel is to raise and lower the volume the top button is to go to the previous track the middle button is to play pause and then the bottom button is to skip to the next track I actually would have thought that the bottom button would have been to go to the previous track in the top on it would have been to go to the next track but I guess it's just the opposite and at the top you have the 3.5 millimeter headphone port which also acts as a lineout port for your speaker systems and then you have the power on/off button which is lit by an LED and then on the right side you have the microSD expansion slot which supports up to 512 gigabytes of storage so technically you can store tons of music on the device so long as you do have that 512 gigabyte microSD card so some of the other things you get in the box is a transparent TPU case you'll also get some paper and then lastly you'll get the USB type-c charging data cable otherwise that's pretty much it for the unboxing you won't get any sort of carrying case which honestly I don't think you really need alright so now to the user interface so setup is pretty straightforward you have the language setup and then you have the region setup so that you can get the FM regional radio stations to which I did forget to mention that this also has an FM radio which is pretty sweet which kind of reminds me of the 90s since we were using a lot of FM radio back in the day because back then in the 90s we didn't really have streaming devices the closest we got to streaming music was with an FM radio now after setting this up I did also update the firmware by simply going to the feo website and downloading the latest firmware I believe it's like 370 megabytes and then transferred that to the micro SD card I then put the micro SD card back into the player and from there I was able to update the firmware on the device it was actually pretty straightforward anyway let's now go through the menu so the first icon you have air is file music if you tap on that you'll get into your music list so within there you'll have a bunch of other icons you'll have all songs artists albums etc if you click on all songs it will take you to all your songs or all your music that you currently have on the device sometimes you'll have to update the device so you'll have to rescan the device for new songs that you recently put onto the microSD card so basically if you go back one step and if you click on the gear icon all the way on the top right that'll take you into a menu here and if you click scan for songs that'll scan the micro SD card for songs or the selected folder you have two options alternatively if you don't want to do that you just scroll down to the menu until you get auto update toggle that on and that'll automatically update every time you basically take out the micro sd card and transfer songs onto the card and transfer it back into the actual player and that'll again that will auto-update your music list now the player also has an equalizer basically in order to get to that if you are in a song you just tap on the album art and all the way on the left hand corner you'll see these three bars or three vertical bars of you tap on that you'll get into the equalizer and to toggle it on on the top right corner you have to turn on that radio button and then you'll be able to mess around with the equalization and if you scroll left and right sorry if you scroll right you'll get the higher frequencies if you scroll left you'll get to the lower frequencies and you can mess around with that they also have presets as well for pop and was it I think a rock additionally if you go back to the last screen you'll see the track information so if it's an mp3 it'll say mp3 if it's a flag file it'll say flag file and then you'll see the amount of Hertz the bits and the kilobits per second so I'm just going to quietly scroll through some of the other options that you have here and you can just check them out as I'm scrolling through them [Music] now getting back to the music player as you can see if I tap on all songs you'll see that that's where all of my music is currently now the response time of scrolling up and down or just tapping on some icons is relatively decent I suppose it's not super fast like on an iPhone or like an Android device but it's not that slow either so it's not super responsive but it's definitely a lot faster than many apps that I've seen in the market today now as I mentioned before this fail m7 damp supports aptX HD and the regular apt X so with regular aptX you're getting 352 kilobits per second and with aptX HD you get up to 576 kilobits per second so essentially this is a very capable device so you get high definition on Bluetooth audio transferred over to your Bluetooth earphones which you don't really get with other mobile devices unless of course you have a Bluetooth mobile device that supports aptX HD and of course you'll also be getting that high quality wired connection as well with that 3.5 millimeter headphone jack something that not a lot of devices still have today and I have no shame in saying that I am looking at Apple and Google hashtag bring back the headphone jack and if I haven't mentioned this already this device also supports a DSD which stands for a direct stream digital it's basically a high resolution format that produces a high resolution signal so you're probably going to see a lot of this in my upcoming review videos of earphones I'm gonna start using this as my default audio playback device I do get a lot of comments asking why I don't use a DAC or adapt so anyway I'm gonna start using this even though I still think that the iPhone 6 is a perfectly capable device of handling high quality audio actually if you didn't know this the iPhone 6 is back can support 24 bit 192 kilohertz audio so again in my opinion I believe that the iPhone 6 is more than capable of handling high quality audio but anyway I'm gonna start using this dab since it does give me that extra edge it does support higher bit rates so anyway that is pretty much it for my introduction on the feo m7 DAP hopefully you guys found this video helpful in some way or form if you did it please do leave a like also if you guys had any questions regarding this vom 7 DAP let me know in the comment section below so for now thank you all for watching and as always I'll catch you in the next one later guys

For the full episode, go to http://twit.tv/show/before-you-buy/164",28,36780,51.0,295.0,31.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e6J4HfWnQZY/hqdefault.jpg,TWiT|TWiT Bits|Best Of,2020-10-07 10:14:19.268373, this is true oh you turn this off here hold on a second I'm working out huh and you know when you're working out you'll want to listen to some tunes I'm not listening to my iphone though I'm not listening to my ipod either I'm not even listening to my fancy Dan Neil Young pono player I'm listen to something brand-new my review today is of this let me take the headphones out and show you my new Phyo x1 it's in the silicone case I do that to keep it from getting wet and it's sealed all around which is kind of nice just exposure to the click wheel and the screen inside of really pretty aluminium solid aluminum case this is a high-res music player so it can playback any kind of digital file I have not just AAC and mp3s but it'll even playback FLAC the lossless compression flack apple lossless and the playback bit rates up to 192 kilohertz 24-bit I mean the highest quality high res files now a portable audio player like this wouldn't be any good if it didn't sound good and they put some pretty good hardware inside of here kyocho x' to use the Texas Instruments 1542 digital to analog converter it's a new part audio files haven't really weighed in on it yet but it does have 112 DB signal-to-noise that's very good a lot better than an iPhone for instance maybe not as good as some of the higher-end audio file decks but this is a high-quality deck with a nice sound also a very good headphone amplifier in here that's able to power even high quality headphones I've been using my Etta modak Yee or fours these are excellent in ear monitors but it'll even power my high impedance headphones like my magnetic plane our high Fineman headphones which which take a lot of juice I think the 35 ohm headphones it's a high impedance and there's enough juice here to listen at normal even somewhat loud listening volumes the controls are good this has not a touchscreen but a nice color screen that has a fairly useful interface lots of good stuff to gapless playback that's something Neil pono player doesn't do it also has a 7 channel equalizer with presets and boy look at all the buttons friend up this not only is there an on/off button but volume up and down previous channel next track back and Settings button and the scroll wheel unlike the ipod actually Scrolls you can even hit the the big fat click wheel so in some ways there's actually a duplication of functionality but that's fine I find it very easy to use very easy to find what I want the screen displays album art in color also bitrate information I think this is well made this is a you know kind of a post iPod portable audio player I saved the best for last the phyto x1 is $100 $100 now that doesn't include storage in a way I kind of like this idea it uses microSD cards and you supply your own SD cards up to 128 gigabytes so I bought a SanDisk hundred twenty-eight gig microSD card for hundred bucks so $200 total for storage and the VAIO x1 nice though you can have multiple SD cards one for you workout one for chillin you know and that's that's kind of cool certainly enough to store as big a music library as you'd want $100 for this so let me give you the pros and the cons but for that I think I need to retire to my relaxation zone after a workout it's so great to relax in the hot tub with your tunes and the x1 comes along with me thanks to that silicon wrapper it's not waterproof but at least it keeps splashes off of it and notice it's even powerful enough to drive these high impedance high five man HD 560 headphones at a reasonable level that's pretty sweet probably shouldn't wear those in the hot tub though let's take off the silicone wrapper and give you the pros and cons classify us x1 Pro well it stands right out at you it's beautifully designed this is aluminum the functions are easy to use we're in the post iPod era people pretty much understand how one of these is supposed to work I love the return of the click wheel it's kind of rubberized feels great the big button makes it very easy to use it doesn't have a hold button but when you press the on/off power switch if you turn off you don't see the screen but also the buttons become inactive so it doesn't really need a hold switch it I like the software I love the equalizer the gapless playback Dark Side of the Moon baby awesome and it's great that I can do both line out and headphone out one Jack the USB micro USB port means I can charge it with pretty much anything and that's both charging and data which is nice so if you don't have a micro SD card reader don't don't worry you just plug it into your computer copy your files onto it 11 hours battery life and FiOS says they're gonna get 215 with a firmware update that's more than enough for me on the cons there's only a couple I left out the most important Pro the price a hundred bucks on the cons of course it does include headphones but for a hundred bucks you have a little extra to buy some high-end fed phones you're not gonna want your Apple earbuds in this you need some good high fidelity in ear monitors to really get the most out of it it also doesn't include any memory but I think that's great it gives me the flexibility to buy one or more microSD cards to fit my needs and with 128 gigs of storage and the player I'm still only paying $200 that's half the pono player okay maybe the file x1 doesn't sound as good to those golden ears as the pono player I really can't tell it sounds great to me and it could play back all my files even the high-res ones it's a definite buy for the fiyo x1 so I'm gonna chill out relax listen to some tunes and send it back to you father Robert you you you you you kids hell I'm naked in here can you you

become quite the hot topic over the past year or so with no product quite as hyped as the pono player the brainchild of music legend Neil Young it raises $800,000 Kickstarter goal within just one day of being on the site and went on to raise over six million dollars in its full 30-day campaign making it one of the most bat Kickstarter campaigns ever after nearly a year of waiting the time has come to finally launch it and we have got one of the first pono players in the country to unbox for you so first up let's take a closer look at this rather lovely wooden box that the pono comes in with the pono logo etched in the front paano actually means righteous in Hawaiian and Neil Young's interpretation of this is protecting the artists intention when they made the record something that he feels has been lost with the compression of digital music his argument is that you no longer need to sacrifice quality for convenience and that is the fundamental idea behind pono so it opens up the Box opens up rather like an old-school pencil case and in the top here we have a little note from Neil Young himself we've designed this player to let you hear the music the way you like to hear it no matter what you use is in 2.0 the music will sound better with pono as the source it goes much a bit more than but I'll be reading inside here you've got a Quick Start Guide and talk to you through how to get an AI player set up on working and then underneath here it's fine iPlayer itself so we have it in black it's kind of a rubber dice sort of finish not the yellow one that's been quite heavily featured in press images but I think there is black and yellow and if you were a Kickstarter backer there were a few kind of metallic limited edition versions from various bands and the like this the shape of it has been why you documented it is going to be a love it or hate it shape Toblerone triangular shaped means it feels quite good to hold in the hand but perhaps not so good for getting into your pocket on the front we've got three buttons for changing volume and also a selection button and this screen here is actually a touch screen which will we'll take a closer look at in a moment so on the bottom you've got the micro SD card slot the 64 gig will come onboard and then you can top it up with your own SD card and there's Mikey Michael USB there for charging on the top here we have two headphone outputs they can be used simultaneously so two people can be listening to the same track at the same time but this output has been specially optimized for being a stereo output so you can connect the point up to an existing amp or any other sort of component you might want to listen to it through so we've actually got an American plug adapter here because it isn't the upon out isn't on a plate isn't actually available in the UK just yet so it is an American one but I'm assuming that when it comes to UK we'll be having a UK adapter and the bottom here we've got the micro USB cable for connecting to the wall adapter standard micro USB lead there and that is everything that is in the box let's talk a little bit more about paano in detail and to turn it on you simply press the middle button here the screen is a little lower res than were used to on the high res smartphones that we have in our pocket today but it's it's not too bad as you can see that you get a visual representation of all the albums that you have and it's it's pretty responsive from flicking through these menus as you can see which is a good thing because these controls don't control the touchscreen there purely for playback and volume controls it's a little look food menu you swipe across to get to artists albums a list of songs and you can create playlists and there's also a Settings menu as well for brightness and things like that to play a song you simply clicking to an artist and then you'll get the playback screen there and if you want to carry on searching for more you can go back and have a look so how do you actually get your high-resolution music onto the polo player well alongside the player Neil Young also launched upon own music which is a high-resolution download store where you can download single tracks or full albums and there's around 2 million tracks on there at the moment and always growing of course if you've got your own high-resolution music selector collection at home you can connect the Pawnee player up to your computer via micro USB or place them directly onto a microSD card and pop it straight into the slot there so there's only one question left to be asked how much is it going to be the u.s. price has been confirmed at $400 but the UK price is still TBC we're chasing pon it up to find out what it's going to be and hopefully get a firmer UK release date as well so as soon as we have that we'll be getting all of our thoughts and our full review on what - so do keep your eyes peeled for that in the meantime we want to know what you think are you a backer of the high resolution revolution and will you be buying a pono player leave us a comment below to let us know and if you'd like this video do give it a thumbs up and click

http://bit.ly/DTYouTubeSub

Like its flagship predecessor, the A&ultima boasts top-level high-resolution audio support, offering support for virtually any audio file in your collection (WAV, FLAC, WMA, ALAC, APE, AAC, DSF, etc.) with a max resolution of 32bit/384kHz for PCM files and native playback of DSD files at up to 11.2MHz. A&K claims it’s capable of “Mastering Quality Sound,” and that isn’t hype: You’ll be hard pressed to find a file at the resolution supported here outside a professional mastering or recording studio.

After spending a week with the SP1000, the best way we can describe it is as a sort of VR device for your ears. The sound seems to open before you, teleporting you from your desk or train seat deep into another aural realm entirely. We primarily experienced this journey via our two favorite pairs of reference headphones: Audeze’s open-back EL-8, and Ultimate Ears’ Reference Monitor in-ears, each offering equally engaging, but notably different sonic experiences.

While certainly not for those with light pockets — or small ones — Astell & Kern’s latest flagship audio player once again raises the bar for the brand as the high-res portable player to beat. Those looking for a transformative portable playback device need look no further than the A&ultima SP1000. Now, if you’ll excuse us, we’ve got to get back to flying the friendly SP1000 skies. We hope to see you up there.

res|Audio,2020-10-07 10:14:19.268656," [Music] for me everyone's music I feel that music is totally soothing to a soul the spirit i think people are a a little happier listening to music is color and way of life passion many things I dream of a melody woke me up I don't have them when so many meters then half schizophrenic but low but I've had music for me it's life [Music] when one studies this, they cannot imagine the amount of time that is invested amount of time it takes to get the recorded music to reach fate there are many frustrations the many how many young people too, but over time one goes sailing in very entertaining which in my case are a race full of bright lights through everywhere as I went on, I realized how the power of music really was a lot in class for having headphones plugged in all the time but I needed it I needed to listen to music all the time I think the music chose me I chose it to go sing I did not feel it since a good boy I I was fortunate to leave in the technically analogous age the first thing I received to listen to it was a vinyl and at first when I was right it was almost that case we go around and with the vic pencil I also listened to a lot of rock for my brother what is led zeppelin I like kurt good de iure always It has been one of my favorite bands there we went like noticing the differences of sound also from tape cassette to cd all equipment were great they had to sound loud we had good speakers they had components separate there was no non-quality there was only quality all 100% analog we use only amplifiers at all we used tubular bells when we wanted to emulate a bell sound not a keyboard we use a network for the voice with some cans that vibrate inside that are they move and what they do like leslie knight real kutcher and present we are trying to give it to the digital and that can be done but you have to instructions the year 2000 turn of the century internet all came a very important musical revolution on a planetary level that gave back to everything, I'm from the napster generation, that is, these guys changed the industry changed the way music was distributed, the loops and began to compress the signals and the quality of the music began to worsen waiting a lot sometimes privileges more how much than quality and life, that is, quality no longer weighs much what people are looking for and clearly it is portability nowadays you can listen to many things different to have them in a very small device that became the effective way to attend now but also and if it loses a little and the quality you can realize some there was some bass that when compressed into mp3 disappears its music] i [Music] I try not to listen to mp3 I do it out of necessity obviously it is filled in m3 as for example we have all these channels and this is pure sound woof woof woof woof and everything transferred to a channel that this red key that the mp3 compresses all these channels and quality is lost and when you listen and listen to hear things that are bad you are going to perceive badly and you will get used to that the stress that produces the signals blurred is the same is like sight hearing is a sense that gets tired and we are at a point where our generation that enjoyed the ease here in an mp3 you are already realizing either by or by a social issue for a theme of taste or for an accessibility theme we are going back to vinyl that time that was very plastic in which there was a lot digital effect much those sounds that eros or that is the sound of the beginning of digital technology beginning to make its way today a mix between analog and digital and that question takes interesting before it was much more valued the delicacy of the sounds and also Let's add to this another problem that is already much more than sounds that is the auto worker as the space race to generate unusual volumes of contained between the song of the beat that is there and we all want that we want the vinyl we want the s that heat we are looking for the quadraphonic lady that pink floyd had we are looking for the sound quality it could have emerson lake and palmer I like it and I know that people who like music value listening to details in the recordings and we take that time in productions but believe that you have to be a musician or be singer is easy not one wastes a lot of time in the studio time traveling one give something nice for others to enjoy and that has a positive gesture and one creates atmosphere where you put one guitar behind the other and add a a cello string that makes you excited and that makes people get excited but people don't know it and it's okay but I think that little by little people are appreciating this is this being so meticulous and be as delicate as a painting and you want people to could somehow be in these sessions I want 'd [Music] then [Music] I wish everyone was missing with this and I wish everyone enjoyed the mixes as I do in my space and if there is a device that can help how to bridge studio work and what comes after the people would be fantastic that's how people can be with us while while we are recording many many successes you can buy now discs in fraction which is another higher quality and exists and the people do it because they already understand that they will earn much more wealth in the sound and is valuing it that is already happening as well as the goldman that were at most now there are reducers there are res audio that means high resolution I would love that that work that is does the study I wish and people had listened to it as I do the I study the entire list that I listen to I like this artist I want to hear it whole but I want to hear it well now people can vibrate just like we do in the studio [Applause]"

speak, a modern and higher quality variant of the classic mp3 player it is therefore a digital audio player with specially adapted android operating system and the possibility to play high resolution audio files I was really curious to hear the difference but everything else you will have a lot of fun after the intro As always, let's take a look at the scope of delivery in addition to the dpx itself, there is still a lot of paperwork and a micro usb cable for charging and of course for large-scale data transfer and all in all, the device reminds a little of a smartphone even if the dimensions or the thickness is perhaps a bit atypical, the housing is 130 x 76 x 13 millimeter in size the design is angular and is quite simple overall a slightly lighter cover around the connections enhances the curved shape around the Volume control and a small glass element on the back upgraded the housing is made entirely of aluminum and the processing is onkyo typically at a very high level at this point no chance for criticism on the dpx 1 android 5.1 runs point one in a specially designed for the music playback adapted version nevertheless the system is quite open held so that you can access the place gate as usual, various apps can download and so on so is also the use of nothing in the way of streaming services like spotify and co the internal memory is 32 gb via two micro sd cards however, the storage space can often be expanded by up to 400 32 GB, i.e. up to 200 GB per slot 400 32 gb might be a little exaggerated but in general you need of course more memory than usual because the high resolution files are logically a little bigger the scratch-resistant display is 4 7 inches and resolves with 1280 x 720 pixels so here we have hd that's enough for me opinion for the device also completely from that displays also quite bright and offers good contrast ratios of the internal battery is specified with a running time of approximately 16 hours in a test phase I didn't quite get to this value for 12 to a maximum of 14 hours if it is because it is being charged, the device is connected to a normal micro usb pc or faster via adapter at the socket inside the dpx 1 it looks neat a snapdragon 801 port core processor with a clocking of 2 3 gigahertz ensures the necessary computing power plus two gigabyte ram all modern interfaces are still on board wlan bis towards the ac standard bluetooth 4.1 usb 3.0 and so on from a technical point of view pretty much everything has been brought up here which can somehow make for an even better sound there we have a symmetrical circuit design for the double digital to analog converter as well as the double amplifier separate and isolated boards dsd conversion in real time upscaling for lower resolution audio files and much, much more i don't want to stop the technical side down to the last detail for most of you these terms are probably of secondary importance therefore I have a link with all information in the video description packed using the device is pretty simple if you have an android When you use your smartphone, it's a home game anyway, but even if you usually ios windows phone or whatever you get used to quickly to the surface and features of the dpx 1 but let's be clear Now we come to the sound I have to honestly say that I have this small products is also seen as an experiment because it is just me very much was very interested in how much better high resolution audio with the right one player sound I can mean a lot of people give a lot of money for these devices are off and are mostly more than convinced of it but is the difference is really so big that in my opinion is the only correct answer yes it really fascinated me how the music can sound because you can hear a song of what you already have felt 100 times somewhere or somehow heard and suddenly you can hear details that you couldn't perceive before sounds totally strange but is in fact, that's the case and that's just damn cool Of course, it is important to use appropriately good headphones otherwise the service provided by dpic science is somehow given away in conclusion, i found it very interesting to have such a device to try and actually got high quite impressed the audio resolution is really awesome and comes damn over the onkyo dpx 1 well over the device I like it a lot, it is wonderfully processed and accordingly the software and operation are of very high quality there is nothing to complain about, but the price is steep for that dp x1 will be charged according to the recommended retail price 799 euros high-quality headphones and possibly micro-sd cards will then come It should also be noted that this price is actually for such a player It is not common for competing products to lie all in a similar area so high resolution audio is generally a more expensive fun but if you treat yourself to something like this you will not be disappointed and with that we have now reached the end of the video, I hope we will you liked it and would be very happy to receive feedback good guys see you next time ciao"

audio|StivVid|head-fi|FiiO|etymotic|sennheiser|KEF|Beyerdynamic,2020-10-07 10:14:19.268710, welcome to my review of the Pheo m9 digital audio player feel was kind enough to include me in the official launch tour of the m9 and this is my review so let's get started this is the box that it was shipped to me in at well there was a cardboard carton on the outside obviously but when I opened it this was the Box I was greeted with it's not actually the you know the the retail packaging would be there were to be an outer box that would have all the graphics and specs of the player and all that stuff like you'd find in a retail shop so this would be the inner box inside of that sleeve and that's how it was shipped to me so we open it up and we find a player wrapped in plastic setting inside this foam both foam insert and then we just make sure we focus and hopefully pull that out I decide there we find the player and the player is a very handsome device you know it's got great it's got a nice weight it's flat on one side and curved on the other and the curved side has all the buttons and controls at the bottom we've got 3.5 millimeter headphone jack that also serves as the line out and the s/pdif and then we have a 2.5 millimeter balanced jack for ballast headphone connection and we have USB C port here for charging and for data transfer and for also using this as a USB DAC with your computer and what's interesting about this is that when you're using it as a USB DAC you can also at the same time this thing's being used as a DAC it can it can transmit Bluetooth audio to another device so there's a lot of there's a lot of utility in this thing one thing I forgot there are some additional things in the box warranty cards and such and QuickStart guide also there's a USBC cable and there is a coaxial audio adapter so you can attach your coax cable right there and it goes into the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack so that's what's in the box anyway I just want to show you it does take a while to boot up so there's the boot up start and it takes literally it takes about 40 seconds for this thing to go from clicking the button to to be into a point where you can actually hear some music so that was one disappointing part of this player for me it was just how long it took to boot up know the saving grace to that is that you can put this unit to sleep just by clicking that power button again you turn the screen off you set the player down it goes into a sleep mode and then you know you could go days and walk up to it and pick it up and hit the hit the power button again and it wakes right up so you don't always have to shut it down completely although if you're carrying it around in a pocket or something like that you might want to because the button especially when it's in its case button gets bumped a lot all these buttons do and there's a way to to switch these off when you're in when you're in lock screen mode so that you're not constantly bumping these but you can't turn switch this one off and it does get it does get bumped quite a bit in fact I did most of my listening without this case on because I found it a little annoying there there probably but some better casing options hopefully Pheo will come up with another case for this that that is a bit more forgiving on on the buttons the buttons are very easily depressed in this case is it's tight-fitting against them so there's a there's a power button there's the volume rocker there's a start/stop button for for starting and stopping the tracks and there's a previous track next track button here so a rocker switch there's a SD card slot on this side yeah it's nice it's nice it feels good it looks good and you'll be happy to know it sounds good so let's get this case off of here because it does it does getting away some so it is just clear silicon it's it's not pretty stiff clear silicon there it is so that's the case that comes with it when it was shipped to me it was on the player I'm not sure if that's how it will be when you buy it from the shop but that's how it wasn't it was shipped to me we can just talk about all the different flavours of Bluetooth this thing does because it does them all I think this is one of the first players that actually has every version of bluetooth it doesn't have a Bluetooth 5.0 it has bluetooth 4.2 but it has all flavors it has you know SPC obviously and optics and aptX HD it does L DAC Sony's new high-res wireless format and it also does hwa which is a high risk wireless audio powered by LH DC which is sort of a competitor to L DAC so you'll find that in some kind of competing players anyway let's load this card in here Oh updated available that's interesting new version detected so let's not worry about that right now okay let's stop right there what I should have done when I saw that there was a firmware update available for the m9 was stop the review go download the firmware loaded onto the player check out what the new features were and then restart the review but I didn't do that I wouldn't finish the review and then I did the firmware update later and what if doubt is that Pheo along with a lot of bug fixes in that firmware update they've added a couple really nice new features let's see if I can get to them here the first of which you know obviously you can connect this player via all types of Bluetooth and it also if you have any DLNA enabled devices on your network you can connect via DLNA so that's nice but what they've added now in this I think you can get to it here is airplay and this is an Android device I think this is the first Android device that have ever seen with airplay most Android devices have Google casts for chromecast enabled devices but I have never seen I've never seen airplay on a on an Android device so you know Apple AirPlay users rejoice this player now has airplay also they've added something called and I'm not sure where it is and let me see I looked it up no I don't know where it is a Pheo link right here so if you turn this on right you can connect to your smartphone and use your smartphone as a remote control for the player so like you could have your player hooked up to your home stereo system and you know sitting on a shelf or whatever with your stereo and you want to change track or you want to change the volume where you want you know whatever you want to do you open up your phone and use the Pheo music app on your phone to control the m9 remotely wirelessly which is a cool feature as well so that's it for the new features I just wanted to cut that in here real quick and now we can get back to the review enjoy so Theo's music playing app is theö music let's go back to home there it is view music so the first time you open that up it actually gives you like a little tutorial but all the different gestures and things that you can use to navigate through the app but you'll need to insert your SD card and you need to scan for music so you need to go into the settings here and I just closed it again settings and scan for songs and I did it let me just focus there I did a scan all one-eyed in it and that scans the internal memory and the SD card there's two gigabytes internal memory on the player and this is a 64 gigabyte card so this gives you an idea of how fast it takes to scan through 64 gigabytes worth of music and it's it's pretty quick yeah it loads the player pretty quickly and I've got all kinds of music on this I've got everything from lossy files to lossless FLAC mostly files and then I have some DSD and I have some selections of high-res tracks on here as well and I'll show you how the player handles different file formats once this thing gets loaded and there it is we're all loaded hit OK go back and now we can search by whatever you like I've searched by artist here and you see all the variety of stuff here now what's interesting is let's see let's find it there's a DSD there let's hit this and hit play the LED lights green here and that green means you're listening to a DSD file so the LED is different colors for different for different file formats which is nice so you can see at a glance what kind of a file you're playing you know I don't know that I really need that I don't really care what kind of file I'm playing I just want to listen to the music I generally I know what kind of file it is I also showed you here in when it lists the songs you'll see a little logo there so there's a little green DST logo there next to a hairy hip a lights name there and if we go back I'll show you what it does for for instance for others some Fleet Foxes here let's go to this album I know is is black so we play Sun it rises from Fleet Foxes and flak lights up or lossless files lost this standard res file so that's 44 116 kilohertz files they will light up purple alright and or a 16-bit 44.1 kilohertz 16-bit files will light up purple so that's CD quality stuff and then if we go to crack up this is a high-res album I downloaded high res lights up yellow so this one is we're gonna swipe down and we can see the stats on that track it's 96 kilohertz 24 bits it shows you 3056 kilobits per second for that particular track so you you know you get a lot of information here in just at a glance about what what your music what music you're playing and and the resolution that you're getting out of the player and it's nice it's nice it's a easy to navigate also if you want to go back to the home screen you swipe up from the right like so and it's not doing it there goes like the home screen that way and then like if you want it to go that's for instance let's go to navigate by album see the dance Asia alright play a song here okay we're in Asia and then we were like we want to go back one level you swipe up from the left and takes you back to the tracks or or you can just use the arrow at the top of the screen so there are a couple gestures you can use to navigate through the player like that stop that for a second now one thing that I did notice I've got the volume here let's say you got the volume here set it 60 now the volume rocker you can see there it let me give it a hand out the way you can see you know you use that it clicks now one thing I don't like when it's in my pocket I like to be able to like one click is one volume level right well that doesn't always not always true with this click wheel one click might not always be one volume level I just like to like I know that we're 60 should be on any given set of headphones and left our one a little bit more volume I like might like to go to 65 and just be able to go click click click click click in my pocket and I'm at 65 but with this wheel you don't really know where you are when you when you click click click click click on the wheel that was one thing I didn't another thing I didn't like the other thing is one of my favorite pair of headphones are these kev-kev m200 earphones they're a little unconventional looking but they they sound fantastic and to me I think they're one of the biggest bargain the personal audio right now yeah actually I think at Christmas right now you can get them for $49 which is ridiculous I think there are regular list prices like 200 but for that money it is an absolute no-brainer now these things have an inline remote right here ok now the inline the button so so this player is compatible with inline remotes you have to switch it on in the menu and I will show you that so we plug this thing in this particular headphone it's a bit tight fit in this jack I noticed right away when I was when I was plugging in you focus again for you there there we go and now we go back to home we'll go to let's see I think it's under the main settings if we go to audio and then inline remote right there you can select inline remote there and then your compatible now look what's happening I'm not touching anything and the volume was going crazy right this was a problem that I had when I first started reviewing this thing this is part of the reason why my review has taken so long to get finished because I contacted Pheo about this problem I was doing really all my listening with these headphones because they're my they're my favorites and this is what was going on the volume driftin all over the place and it was like you know I'd start a track and I would set it down on the table next to me and all of a sudden you know the track would stop and I picked the player back up and I'd start the track again and it would start back with volume at 120 and blow me out of the you know blow my ears out so that is because and you might run into this I'm not saying this is going to happen with every headphone that has an inline remote but it does have an issue with this particular pair of headphones and it's inline remote so that's something to be wary of when you if you have if your favorite pair of headphones have an inline remote the solution to that is to of course let's go back oops let me unplug this for a second because it's going to keep the flames gonna keep jumping around on me we go back home we go back to settings and we go back to audio and to inline remote right there and just just turn it off you know just use this as if you don't have an inline remote and then you won't have that problem so if having an inline remote for stopping and starting a track or going to previous or next tracks is it you know you have to have that you you may you know you may want to test it out with your headphones before you before you buy this because that problem was driving me crazy for a while until I figured it out but now that it's figured out you know I've really enjoyed this player it's been really nice really nice I was going to show you something else here just a second oh yeah so it comes with these apps installed and title is one of those apps right but you can also there's there's certain apps that are that are white listed by Pheo for this player Spotify is one of them so I managed to download Spotify now it's not straightforward you can't go it does this this app does run a version of Android it's a very customized version audio optimized version of Android but you cannot use the the Play Store to download whatever music app you might you might like best so there are only certain apps that work title is one of them comes pre-loaded there's also a Korean I think it's Korean might be this one here you know yeah what is that I don't know what that is because I don't read Korean or whatever that might be let's go back so that I think that was Nettie's music there's another one down here called move that one is in a foreign language as well KK box I think is the Korean one when it's also foreign language and it doesn't work in the US so there's no really no reason to have this on a u.s. player if your URL you know if you're logging onto a Wi-Fi in the United States you won't even be able to to access any of the tracks on these sites so another thing you download is a different version of a file explorer it comes with this file management program which i think is adequate you don't really need yes file explorer but if it's something you're used to using on your android phone you know that might be something nice for you to have but actually I'll show you title here real quick it works it's pretty smooth actually I'm not a big fan of title mainly because you know when I call up title like just I'm not a big rap or R&amp;B fan and it seems like that's what title features the most well it's kind of you know it makes sense jay-z it's the company so he he has lots of Beyonce and his friends at the front page but I find it hard to find the music that I'm I that I would be interested in on title it just is not the friendliest UI for me now you may love it you may disagree and I'm not gonna pay 20 bucks a month for the high-res either so but I did I did do it one month for $9.99 just to just to prove the title worked with the player and it does it works it works fine we're on the internet now and there we go Steven Wilson is playing don't hate me off of his four and a half album so yeah it works fine and if this was a high-res track if I had done the twenty books a month you know this this little logo down here would be lit saying hi fi but I did not do that so this is standard rest track anyway so that's title it works well these gestures aren't working very well right now there we go and yeah that's good now what you're gonna want to know is how does it sound it sounds very good if you had a Pheo player before you know feos how sound is is you know warm the warm side of neutral I would say that there's a slight emphasis on the mid bass section which gives vocals really nice presence treble doesn't ever seem to get harsh to me which is great because I'm particularly sensitive to to sibling in harsh treble yeah it sounds it sounds smooth and warm and you know for lack of a better term musical it's I wouldn't call it an audiophile player in the term in the sense that it's not overly analytical this is this is a very musical player and you know it lets me that's what I want when I when I'm listening to music I don't want to be listening to the gear I want to listen to the music and if a player can get out of the way and make the music enjoyable well then that's the player for me and to me this player does a great job of that so at 299 Pheo I think have a hit on their hands this is a really really nice player it takes a couple knocks from me for the the inline remote compatibility and for the silicone case that it comes with which I just don't think is a very good quality and kind of hampers the operability of this of this device but other than that good job Theo I don't have any balanced headphones to try with it I will soon but I don't have them here now there is a high gain and a low gain setting on this so I find that these keffe headphones even though they're impedance isn't very high for whatever reason they perform much better on how I gain these are these are ear earphones that seem like the harder you push them the better they sound so I've been listening to them at high gain but my Etta modok's I listened to at low gain they sound beautiful they're my reference and then I have a pair of Sennheiser HD six hundreds which I plugged in and had a listen to it for a short time at high gain it it drove them with plenty of power and not as well as my as my tube setup but you know and I don't know how if you really be using HD six hundreds on a portable setup anyway so you know it's kind of a non-issue and then I have also some high impedance some 250 ohm beyerdynamic HD there are dynamic DT two fifties which I love those are the headphones that I keep in my nightstand and by the way you know this is this this thing is a great portable it's a great desktop amp it can be used with your computer as the standalone USB or it can be used as a USB sending bluetooth to another device you know you can plug this into a pair of powered speakers it's a great desktop system you can use this with your home set up run it through you run it through the big stereo use it as a transport you know playing digital files into your home system yeah it does a lot it does an awful lot and it's compatible with Sony's old AK high-res Bluetooth headphones and also the new hwa headphones that should be coming out I haven't seen too many of them yet but hwa headphones with L HDC built in and yeah 2.99 I say go get one alright so that's it that's my review of the m9 I hope you enjoyed it and we'll see you next time

89,kKWQ20GTPiQ,Almosteverything84 Reviews,UCFK-WViYNdY8rgePu7KKnaA,HIFI Walker H2 First Impressions - Audio Player,"My Thoughts:

Unfortunately, my iPhone is only 16GB and I can barely old any music at all, let alone the apps and pictures. I really wanted to get something that could hold my entire music library and not need to use data to access it. I remember the days of starting with the Nomad Jukebox and the HIFI walker reminded of that. It was simple to use and housed all my music in one location. 
The HIFI Walker is a relative of those types of devices and adds modern technology to produce HIFI sound. I’m going to avoid the tech about decoding but what I can say is using quality headphones and quality cables this sounds much better than running of my iPhone. 

The Bottom Line:

If you are looking for a one local device to house all your music and produce great quality sound, this will make you happy.",28,28664,40.0,99.0,34.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kKWQ20GTPiQ/hqdefault.jpg,hifi walker|amazon|reviews|audio player|mp4 player|mp3|hifi,2020-10-07 10:14:19.268893, [Music] this is basically a digital audio player but it's for someone that maybe doesn't put older music on their iPad iPhone Android or a really just a smart phone or tablet this is for someone that maybe you know as a ton of ton of music in a lot of different file formats you know mp3s the list goes on and on but just you know files that might be all over the place they just want to isolate them on a USB they want to just load them on to this itself can hold a lot it comes with 16 gigabytes but you can really expand it up over you know I think the 256 is the number so you could stick one of the card in there you can you could really put everything on it I think most people will find that the quality of the sound is pretty good even when you're using bluetooth they you know they do some ranting and raving about some of the technology to get an Enhanced experience you know in high definition I think it achieves that it's it's certainly gonna depend on you know the headphones that you're using of course and everything has to have to sync and and work together the unit itself does come with a micro SD card of course you could swap that out if you want but like I said it's 16 gigabytes you can transfer all the files from a computer on there or you could do something else the it's you know it's kind of thick it has a little bit of weight to it you have your your scroll wheel click back key photo reverse and modes so we'll turn it on with the power button at the top and you have a couple categories to go through system settings other settings Explorer will stick on the category music I load it on a bunch of songs already so you can see 691 songs this is just off the card included this is really just dumping some of my iTunes library in here and you know if we went by album find the you know the wheels pretty pretty easy to navigate and I love that you could just have that one key to go right back see what we got in here a lot of old stuff Pinkerton there's the album and that's how you would get it going so this is what it looks like on the screen when you're playing something then you have your normal keys now you want to show where your volume is right on the side you could put like a lanyard through here or it could store like earbuds you have the micro SD card in there already and then on the bottom headphone jack the 3.5 millimeter micro USB charging port and another Jack if you right here if you wanted to just for a line out you connect a speaker or something like that it's able to test the Bluetooth on this on a couple different things I had some Bluetooth headphones various speakers and then I paired it with had a mono tube amp amplifier that I use you know it's it's pretty good it can be a little a little I don't know what the word is you know intermittent if you are using some I don't know some generic devices because I had some really weird speakers that kind of had some weird connections with this thing I mean you have to know where the antenna is and this and you know use accordingly but you'll have to test that on your specific device I mean most of the mainstream stuff that I use like Jael the mono tube and Sony had no problem with connections on this at all even in my car I am using an aftermarket Pioneer head unit right now but no issues no way she was getting on there and you'll see that even the screen just goes off kind of goes it doesn't it doesn't burn the battery you know all in all I think that this is a great player that's going to play you know above-average sounding quality you know it does depend I mean for me I'm not gonna use bluetooth much on this because I just don't like the degraded quality of the sound and you you can always tell the difference I think on something like this you know I have a pair of high quality headphones that I you know spent several hundred dollars on and you know that makes a difference it makes a difference with any player but to get really the true benefit out of this you got to use some quality cables and connections and it has to be directly connected that's how you're going to experience you know the high definition right the music you're not gonna get it over a Bluetooth signal you could even connect this directly to you know speakers as a using eyes like kind of like a mini app and you know you can experience the quality that way as well so if you're just looking for something though - you know Bluetooth and just kind of have a larger what you call like flash drive - for your music I don't know if I would go with this it's more this is more expensive and it's designed for you know an enhanced quality listening so if you're looking for that and you can directly connect to it I think you'll be pretty happy thanks for watching

from an audiophile brand like vo and it also is high res audio Wireless certified because it uses the latest Qualcomm chip that supports certain code acts like Qualcomm xapi TX l dak SBC AAC just to name a few when it comes to giving you really high quality listening experience even if you're using in the wireless bluetooth mode it's also one of the cutest and smallest designs that we've seen yet from a high res player it's a little reminiscent of the Shandling and 0 but the m5 improves on many of those features and giving you more of this Wireless high res Kodak's not including again the aforementioned SBC AAC which the Shandling lacks in addition Pheo has also put in some fitness functions including a pedometer and there's even a seseri band that can transform it into a SmartWatch of sorts this model here sells for $99 so it's certainly very competitive and it relies on a full touchscreen display which is also IPS the m5 uses a pretty high quality DAC or digital to audio converter chip and it's the a k43 77 Doc's are one reason why these dedicated mp3 players still exist today just because in more premium players like this the audio quality through this chipset is going to give you more granular detail and music reproduction compared to what we'll find on most smartphones and why this market still exists this can also work as a pass-through DAC to improve your existing audio quality you can connect it by USB C to your computer and then basically if you're playing back sound from your computer it's gonna pass through the DAC on this player and then you're gonna plug your headphones into this player and it becomes almost an external sound card that then improves the audio quality so you can use it as a USB DAC otherwise in the Bluetooth mode it also has built-in microphones so you can even use it for making phone calls and it's a noise cancelling microphones as well so there's a lot of interesting smart features which are being integrated and here we'll find an extra screen protector for the front display there is an existing screamer Tector applied onto the rear of the player which we can also peel off just to protect it from fingerprints and scratches a QuickStart guide as well as the USB type-c cable for charging and the pass-through DAC function and there's also a clip that you get inside of the packaging that allows you to easily wear this onto a shirt taking a closer look at the design of m5 it does feel extremely premium the entire body is made of aluminum chunk unibody and the frontier is dominated by that glass which gently curves off at the edges on the top you'll find access to the type C port there's also the micro SD card slot for you to pop in your own card the very top here also features the 3.5 millimeter headphone track we'll also find access to volume controls which are tactile and responsive in addition to a power key the rear if the player just says Pheo it's very shiny it's also made out of a glass material and also stamps proudly high res audio and high res audio Wireless it takes roughly 10 seconds for the player to boot up and off otherwise were presented to a very simple and easy to use interface initial impressions would be that the touchscreen is extremely sensitive it's super easy to use all the icons are oversized and they're well saturated as well now as a quick size comparison here's the base play p3000 which doesn't have a touchscreen and also here is the X 2o X 3400 that we did a review on a very popular model also a budget premium high 5 player and you can see it's a lot larger by comparison even though this is already smaller than most of her average smartphones here in 2019 so you get the idea of how lightweight and tiny the m5 is by comparison but definitely don't be fooled it still packs a punch in terms of giving you really crystal clear and super detailed audio quality for those that want the best and sound but also in a really compact form factor so taking a closer look at its kind of menu features we can see the time information in the very top the volume controls you can also tap on here to adjust that and when you tap one so you can also use the slider here to move up and down to change the volume further taking a look at the functions one by one starting with the step counter or the pedometer you do have to tap on start too in order for it to begin recording your steps using the accelerometer if you don't tap on that it doesn't automatically detects your steps but afterwards we can actually leave this widget and you can see the small walk icon on the background here that means that your number of steps are currently being tracked it's something a little bit on the sensitive side and not quite as accurate as say a xiaomi me band or honor band so if you have an existing SmartWatch it's not going to be you know the most amazing feature in the world but it's a nice little touch if you just want to bring along one device when you're out running or jogging a lock page on the side will also display the date as well as how many steps you walk during that session for that date under category you can see different types of music through various genres we can create playlists directly on the player and we can also sort by the artists album as well as the genre now swiping over again we can take a look at our currently playing song and from the main home screen you can also have the ability to swipe down like a notification tray to take a look at the current song that's being played you can also adjust the play pause skip track commands as well as the brightness of the display so that can all be done pretty easily using this gesture and again the UI as a whole is very smooth and responsive now I can tap on browse files if you have more complicated file structures on the SD card for you to then load back and then play along you can then see that information here so the player itself the screen measures one point five four inches diagonally so very similar to a lot of smartwatches we've seen it is a little bit small in the sense that it will only show about four rows of information when it comes to song titles but the kinetic scrolling here is actually very smooth and responsive and not too big of a deal when it comes to interacting with it the next function is gonna be that Bluetooth receiver so you can turn on Bluetooth to both connect to wireless headphones if you're listening to music when running and jogging and there's a small LED light as you can see there that will begin flashing in the pairing mode aside from receiving wireless headphones you can also connect it again to your smart phone if you want to control music that's up playing from your phone's memory in addition to transform you know wired headphones into wireless ones basically connecting again headphones into this and now connecting this using bluetooth to your smart phone you're basically turning your wired more expensive audiophile grade headphones Wireless and we can also take a look at the equalizer function now this player does not support custom eq's which is one site compared to the Shandling m0 for example but there are a few presets which do in fact work and changes the properties of the sound so you can select between rock classical jazz pop dance vocal and metal the next function over is recording so it leverages team microphones and turns it into a voice recorder so you can record maybe quick clips and maybe a to-do list as well as meetings lectures things like that it does indeed work and just stores those recordings directly onto your memory card so I can tap on this to begin and you can see that it's going to start there's a colorful an indicator of how much sound is being picked up and those are all the core features of the player just loops around and around and either direction and a carousel moving into audio quality and performance the feel m5s don't disappoint overall you get early clean and detailed sound and they work particularly well with hybrid in your monitors I have a bit more of a sensitive tuning to them in particular I was really impressed with the mids as well as with trebles anything that's acoustic and relies on vocals these are extremely clean and you can hear so many layers of details and textures within the vocals simply something that you won't notice when compared with a typical smartphone being used as an mp3 player for example the chips here are being focused more on power efficiency being such a small unit is gonna work better within your monitors and your phones as well as smaller headphones as opposed to something that's super punchy in terms of bass but overall you saw that it really balanced sound it's super pleasant for pop music electronic music so really impressive here when paired with good quality earphones in addition to a properly recorded track you do get a very immersive and live Lee dimensional roomy sounding experience when being used as a Bluetooth receiver for your headphones sound quality is also really good there's no hints at all of static or distortion in the background even though we're now wireless so you can play and pause the track there is almost no latency at all you can watch a video comfortably and you can also listen to music with just so much more detail and resolution and balance than what you'll find from connecting you know wireless earbuds directly to the phone or tablet just because this thing has much more powerful internals as well as a higher quality DAC that's doing the job in conjunction with the higher quality earbuds that you're using as well with better drivers and whenever audio is being played you can see that there's gonna be an LED indicator that starts glowing a magenta color just to give you an indicator versus blue or just when audio is paused to conserve on battery the screen will also be turned off when music is being played back so that it can last a little bit longer and an indeed it lasted me about 14 hours in my testing in this Bluetooth mode which is I think quite good for something so small really the last thing to point out would be the quality of the microphones which I also found to work much better than expected the noise cancellation is actually a great feature that many wireless earbuds are even lacking so you can actually make phone calls and slightly crowded spaces and it still is able to delineate and pick up your voice quite well so that's more or less it as far as our closer look and hands-on review of the Pheo m5 overall I think this is an excellent and just really cute mini digital audio player now this may seem like a dying breed at first because here in 2019 even Apple has more or less pulled out of making dedicated music players but this market still exists to those that are audio files and crave higher-quality sound that's more clean more precise nuanced and balanced allowing you to take full advantage of the drivers found on more expensive earphones and in-ear monitors than what you'll get from plugging it into a cheaper player or directly into your smartphone so a device like this with higher quality internals is going to provide you that but also and one of the sleekest and smallest form factors yet $99 in the world of audiophile gear is also considered relatively inexpensive and even Pheo cells more expensive models that technically give you a slightly more resolution in detail so if you are someone that once even higher quality sound there are certainly options to consider as well but this strikes a good balance of being good enough that the difference is noticeable compared to again playing back music from your smartphone but also being relatively compact and not really breaking the bank which makes it I think a good choice even for consumers looking to step up the audio performance that they're getting and they want to look for a dedicated device maybe to take to the gym or as the everyday player to just navigate around with that's going to give you really clean audio quality and also Wireless features to boot that are also high-res certified so you can check out more details if you're interested in a links down below a very interesting player that also dabbles and some fitness but those are I would say mostly secondary it's still going to being primarily focused on sound and giving us a very sleek and elegant design and UI you can check out more details if you're interested in a links down below but for now that's been our video thanks for watching throughout OS reviews that's been the Pheo m5

now superior master audio quality however in order to test the player properly against say it's own CD playback against streaming I had to figure out a way to quickly and effectively match the levels of the two formats and what I mean by that is is play a CD find the average call it decibel level of a particular track that was comfortable while I listen to it and then when I would play that same track on title either in high fly or master let's just stick with high five since that is supposedly the same as CD I would have to adjust the volume on my integrated amplifier so that there wasn't this vast discrepancy in SPL and what I noticed when I did that was with with regards to title and hi-fi I would actually have to increase the volume on my integrated amp to match that of CD that is to say that CDs in a physical CD in the tray was louder than streaming that same file size or file quality to the same exact players so I would have to increase the volume on my integrated amp so that all things were largely or as close as makes no difference equal and in doing that CD suddenly didn't sound any better or worse than the hi-fi playback had I not done that CD sounded markedly better but were they actually markedly better or was I just responding to SPL and much like the color blue in high-definition and ultra HD televisions and the reason why so many TVs are biased towards the color blue in their grayscale and color is because our brain does this interesting thing with the color blue and we perceive it as clarity we perceive it as quality sharpness I mean just better and as a result SPL kind of does the same thing we we that instant boost of volume is easily discerned by our brains as enhanced quality and so when you take that into account and you match the physical disk with its high fine equivalent playback well then the two really don't have much difference in them so to take this a step further I wanted to see what would happen if you take a master recording and you also match it to its physical counterpart because in my testing which I and this is this is pretty much without fail in fact I don't think I've run across a situation where this has not been the case but title master recordings tend to be on average 6 to 8 DB louder than any other format whether it's hi-fi or loli you know lower bitrate mp3s and even physical discs themselves it is just a hot hot hot mix and so knowing that some tracks need to be brought down 6 DB some as much as 9 and 12 decibels how then does master differ from say hi-fi is that quality that supposed quality enhanced quality higher bitrate just better file is it there for that much better or that night-and-day different from when it first plays because I've got to tell you when I hit play on a master recording without remembering to adjust for SPL I'm blown away I'm like oh my god this is so much richer this is so much more dimensional and palpable and this and that and it it does it allows you but then when I remember that okay well how loud was the last track because if you're not listening to an entire album and master quality and you are say shuffling and it is going from hi-fi to mastered and - you know load hi-fi and it's back and forth back and forth that can be very very jarring and as a result if you really want to sit down and critically understand what it is that you're listening to you have to level the playing field and when I level the playing field for title master recordings what did I discover well shockingly they didn't Bowl me over and in fact it became very difficult to distinguish even the master recording from say it's comparable CD yeah that's right it it should be better than even its physical media counterpart in a disc and yet when you level the playing field and account for the variables it becomes that much more difficult to hear the differences now I'm not saying that there is no difference but it becomes very hard and requires you to listen even more closely to pick up the extremely extremely subtle differences in the quality of the recordings why this is so fascinating to me is because I wonder how many people who are so animate about you know high-res music files whether it be master or mqa or things like that how many of them are basing that upon going from say a hi-fi or normal streaming experience to this and not accounting for the jump the often dramatic jump in SPL and if they were to go back if you are one of these people and if you were to go back and adjust an account for boost in SPL whether it's a boost or not but if you were to just level the playing field as it relates to volume how different might your experience be because for me there is still a difference between say CD and a master quality recording but it's not night and day it's not black and white and that means that as a as a consumer we have certain decisions than we need to make is how much is that say 10 or 15% worth because prior to adjusting for SPL I may have said that you're getting a 25 30 35 maybe even 40 percent gain in quality depending on the recording depending on the track you take that as PL benefit or boost or whatever you want to call it out of the equation and you level the playing field we're talking about 5 10 % difference so like everything in a V it really does come down to how much do you want to spend and how much are you willing to invest in extracting that last ounce or two of performance from your system then what's that worth is that worth 10 extra dollars about 15 extra dollars a month is that worth you know a couple extra dollars per file even I don't know but this is something that interests me because for several days maybe even weeks I have to admit I fell victim or fell prey to a psychological trick and once I realized what was happening and I took a step back and looked at everything as objectively as possible it was fascinating to me how little difference there there was there there became how little difference there was was it between physical media a disk its hi-5 streaming equivalent and supposedly the superior master quality file not a night and day difference but that's what this series is about it's about an exploration and honestly it's it's more about an honest discussion because I think in the digital age with streaming and convenience and everything being right there and so able to be readily manipulated including ourselves the listener the viewer how easily we can be manipulated I want this to be a discussion so I put it to you where do you stand on this have you done this experiment yourself did you even think to do this experiment yourself is it all in differences in volume or is there an actual perceivable quality difference and if there is how great do you think that quality difference is so yeah that's it that's what I wanted to talk about today I think you all so much for hanging out and sticking with this channel while Christy and I were often getting married in France I appreciate all of you that wished us well and that watched the not-so daily vlog we do have a few more of those coming up since we did spend quite a few days in France but I didn't want to put this video out there sooner than later because this has been a topic that has been on my mind and on my phone as a note to bring up with you guys for several weeks now and I figured now's as good a time as any so let me know what you think in the comments below and as always the only person that has to like the sound of your system is you so until the next video everybody thank you for watching and we'll see you on the next one bye
92,cmbGjkuvikY,ANA[DIA]LOG,UCaBStRQQh2sN2K_Ay-uXwUA,The Good & The Bad of High-Resolution Audio,"In this video we take a look at the issues and positives aspects of Hi-Res audio, the definition, the file types, certification issues and much more. Does HRA make any sense? 

N.B. Again I got mixed up! MQA is a lossy foramt, even when the origami is fully unfolded. Sorry!

analog music reproduction in this episode we're gonna take a deep and sincere look to what is the current conception of what is high resolution audio high resolution music the naked truth are you ready let's get to it okay guys we're gonna go through eight main points where I want to try to understand to focus on the main issues the main aspects of what is high resolution audio and I mean what is the conceptions what are the issues the problems that are making a lot of confusion in this world in this environment for audio files for high fatigue and just normal consumers because obviously the more confusion we have the more people are gonna go take a distance put a distance ignore what is something that could be potentially could be good is it that good right after this okay so first point does it make sense any sense to talk about high resolution audio well in a while we're gonna take a look also actually at the definition but let's just say that high resolution audio as we all know considers takes into consideration a high bit depth depth and a high frequency response and these do make sense not only because we have an increase of the quality of the normal frequencies a lot of people are already think of the higher frequencies we're not gonna hear those wait a moment we also want high quality normal standard frequencies 20 Hertz 20 kilohertz plus with high-resolution audio equipment you can also acquire actually the lower register but also the higher register the extremes of what is a true audio signal I did a video where I demonstrated or at least I reported some proof regarding what is capable of what the human hear in the human body is capable of hearing what it picks up from sound ultrasound beyond 20 kilohertz if it makes sense or not it does take a look at that video here's a link and you will understand why those higher frequencies usually above 20 22 kilohertz what is unfortunately the cut down of a normal CD does make sense to be inside a file inside a recording why it can really make a difference and achieve a higher fidelity overall okay so these two points are think are paramount in saying yes it does make sense to talk about high resolution but there are issues but there are some standards some aspects that need to be satisfied in order to achieve that let's proceed okay our second point is misinformation a lot yes especially in the first moments of high resolution 2000 I would say 2013 14 15 we started to talk about this topic we started to see the logos appear here and there mainly on Sony products but not only there was a lot of it misinformation and in fact if you go and check the Wikipedia page from kapeniak page of high-resolution audio it says unreasonably understandably that it is a commercial type of information type of logo it is not something that it is associated to a precise specification which instead now it is it also says technical but technical doesn't mean anything I mean there are some specs that need to be satisfied which now we do have we'll get back we'll get through this in a while so I just wanted to put in some attention on the fact that we did have a lot of misinformation and a lot of self attribution I mean a lot of people claimed their records or the year was high-res in certain moments while it was not like that or just barely like that okay I don't want to obviously make any names but we did have that moment of crisis fortunately I think we're going out from that and we do have some precise points in our landscape to which we can anchor our knowledge and go ahead and no separate what is good and what is bad coming to it okay now let's come to the core of this video the main point point number three the definition because a lot of people don't know this and I think it's very important paramount importance make this clear yes there is a definition there is exact standards that must be satisfied that need to be met in order to achieve in order to proclaim yourself high-rez whether if your gear whether if you're a recording etc now we'll take a look okay so we're talking we're talking about a definition of obviously analog and digital high resolution why I look now you understand why we're talking about a definition established by the Japanese audio Society okay so they established starting in 2004 and now updated in 2019 and of 2019 in September 3rd what exactly is high resolution so I want to read this together with you and I'll put the the text on on the video so you can follow me in principle the definition of high res audio is based on the announcement of Japan electronics and information technology industry association je ITA on the March 26 2014 high res audio logo applicable products Jas defiance is to fulfill the following specification on the recording reproduction and signal transition process these three aspect guys recording something I already said a dozen zillion times which was very important and I'm happy to see now there this is canonized reproduction our gear and signal transition I mean while you're working with high resolution audio so as you can see the first point is analog process yes because obviously the output is an analog signal so even that has to satisfy specific requirements high resolution requirements as you can see finally we're talking about microphones yes because obviously if you don't record with high res a gear mics etc you're not gonna have a high resolution a true native high resolution audio format audio signal music okay so number one microphone response performance at least forty thousand Hertz 20 ki 40 kilohertz or above during recording also number two the amplification performance must be at least 40 kilohertz or above again point three speaker and headphone performance must be 40 kilohertz or above so now we finally have some parameters that we must face and use this is the reference okay so and say let's go ahead now let's take a look at the digital process number one recording format capability of recording using 96 kilohertz / 24 bits format or above so unfortunately there was a lot again of misinformation I'll get I'll go back to this but especially in 2015 in America we decided that high resolution music they also made a logo which disappeared was just anything above CD quality 44.1 kilohertz 16 bits everything above that was high-res no that's not true now it isn't for sure here we're saying it it has to be at least 96 kilohertz / 24 bits otherwise it's not high resolution and we're having some problems there because a lot of people are claiming that their products are high res with lower frequency samples with lower bit depth so number 2 interface input/output interface with the performance again of that decoding 5 playability 96 24 above a flak or wav I mean again we're just repeating that every type of reproduction of acquirement of playback must satisfy these parameters self recording equipment digital signal processors DSP processing digital to analog conversion all have to meet these specific requirements so what is the problem here yes which brings us to our fourth point that we do have these parameters but are we sure that these are met from the different companies and labels where are we finding our high resolution software now online that's the only place because obviously we do not have unfortunately a physical media where to put high res unless we're talking about a USB key or something like that a solid-state drive but that's not a true mass product of with high res that's something just carrying high res in fact it's just liquid music so we're getting all our stuff all our music from online services it can be streaming it can be sold as an album but I get barrel files come less compressed or more compressed usually I'm in most cases these actually if they are high res they must be lossless so what's happening the main streaming services high-resolution streaming services so we're not talking about Spotify its Emelia and something similar like that we're talking about Cobos or talking about title we're talking about high res audio and these services are certified that's what at least they claim in their websites and I'm sure it's true because they are following they submitted an application and they were approved by the Japanese audio Society so their stuff is certified although I have a problem here because I see that for example in cobos you have the logo for anything that goes above high res quality so maybe I'm thinking I don't know that that rule is still accepted I actually don't know what is happening because we have these parameters but as again I see that instead there is for it for example 48 kilohertz or only the 24 bits music that gets it's nice little yellow logo high resolution but that's not true according to the Japan audio society maybe things are slowly changing I do not have the answer if you have the answer please chime in and write your comment and why we have this mixture of different types of resolution I just want to make a side note unfortunately resolution is a very bad term they chose because resolution technically means the bit-depth how many bits define each sample so we have this unfortunate this sad make sure this combining of different meanings in this specific term any case when we say high-res we mean what we just said for gear everything above 40 kilohertz they focus mainly on the frequency response and instead for audiophiles we're talking about everything that is above or matches 96 kilohertz sampling rate 24 bits oh I just wanted to add why is import a certification because as you can imagine we can a lot of people could just take that is what was happening for a specific amount of time a few years ago just you take the single CD quality or even lower maybe file and you just up sample that you just up sample it it's very easy you can do it with any given free software at that point you have a file which is magically high-res but it it sonically crap res absolutely in any case let's go ahead point number five here certification that's another big issue because as you can imagine as you can see when we see a review when we see the specs of a manufacturer online they can write whatever they want I mean yes they are submitting I hope a documentation proving that their gear does have specific does meet specific characteristics that they are asking which we have seen before but that's not probably happening I mean it didn't happen for the for Volks fate works back and for all those other European automobiles that were claiming that they were have had very low polluting factors while instead the true measurements were very high remember that that was very big in Germany and here in Europe that big issue it's same here I mean nobody's gonna check that much in detail I don't think anyone is gonna go to jail for this so a lot of aspects are pumped are really enhanced inflated unfortunately they're not true that's why good reviews also have measurements together with with just the text and that's good that's a good idea because you really put out on the benchmark everything and you try to see if the product really meets those specifications so that's also a big issue I think yes high resolution audio gear it means it's above 40 kilohertz okay I want to have the certainty I want to be hundred percent sure that what I'm buying is high-res it does reach that frequency response and that's an issue I mean I'm sure that good and serious companies are following the rule but a lot of smaller companies or somebody is just born now it's gonna cheat a little bit they might cheat so we have to be careful okay let's proceed point number six what type of files are high-res because this is important to understand what we're talking about obviously wow with the WAV what WAV files are uncompressed and those can be high-res also AIFF is uncompressed as well as as you can imagine DSS and dff which is that they're carrying the father files for DSD which is uncompressed music high quality high resolution music we also have Isaac an Imagine flack and alack the Apple codec and these are compressed but they claim to be and they are lossless um in fact the streaming services heavily rely these especially flack I mean almost everything is flack actually high-risk streaming audio so these are the main files let's proceed I just wanted to add something that I forgot that the Japan audio society also started to add a lot of information on what is high resolution wireless audio there's a lot of new of a news on this it's very exciting because until now that was really something neglected instead we have these certified codecs they have it must be L DAC or LH DC and now finally this type of audio has its own logo as you can see so wireless audio is high resolution wireless audio is our truth reality welcome Wireless I would like to just spend a few words on the mqa anomaly MQA is not a codec nqa is not a type of file mqa as the acronym goes is master quality authenticated so that is something very important which was as we know developed by meridian and then now it's expanding greatly but that's mainly built upon FLAC files which are compressed in a specific special way that which way they they called origami now I claim different things in different videos ok I want to make a clear statement nqa is lossy until the end of its last origami unfolding when it's fully unfold it is lossless full high resolution plus I think something positive although unfortunately it's a prophet prophet Airy format property Airy authentication which you have to pay in order to use is that it is something certified it is an authentication which I think it's something positive in fact title does not need to have a certification for its files because title uses its masters masters the special high quality masters are nothing but mqa files and unfortunately if you don't have an mqa decoder will go more in depth into this you're not absolutely listening to what is inside buried India in that origami so the title masters I mean be careful you if you do not have proper gear you're not hearing the full potential of it okay so mqa although a lot of people are against it hate it I like for example all the the lineup of cord do not like it they don't want to implement it I understand but but it is a form of authentication and I like that we need that okay point number eight okay the final question is it really better obviously I don't want to give a final answer to this I just want to put my two cents on this say what I think obviously I think that high resolution audio is fantastic but obviously it isn't always fantastic in it it isn't automatically fantastic it isn't automatically a good thing like automatically it an mp3 is worse than a CD you never know I mean maybe something properly done is better in a lossless for a null in a lossy format so what I'm trying to say is that high resolution albums version high resolution version of a specific album isn't automatically better than for example a CD or for example I was as always saying an mp3 possibly with a high bitrate or a lot of people do not like vile in this sense they prefer high-res that doesn't matter I mean even a crappy vinyl could be much much better than a high-resolution version of an album also because all all of these are being remastered now in order to if we're talking about old recordings where we have to get the tape and make a transfer these are being remastered and in this moment as we all know we have this loudness war where a lot of stuff is compressed is limited on the top we're losing dynamics there are lots of passages we're working in a fully digital domain a lot of conversions etc etc so a lot of data a lot of information may not always may be lost along the way hence a normal simple first second CD Edition might be much better than high resolution version issued released today that's it that's what I think guys now you tell me what you think in your comments I know a lot of people are gonna hate me for this this topic it's very complicated I'm sure I left a lot of information out but you can absolutely fill in ok guys thank you again and especially today I want to say remember

10:14:19.269041, hi everyone welcome work with all three of X period early today I want to talk all about music particularly high res audio on the Sony Xperia z5 as well as if you connected devices they serve a pair of headphones which are the sony MDR one is and a little portable bluetooth speaker let's walk kicking off with the Sony Xperia z5 one of them in 10 points of the phone is audio it's something that they have had a big push on previous flat trips for example from the original Xperia z3 when they launched high res audio high res audio if you didn't know is the next stage in audio quality you probably listened to your average trucks in mp3 which isn't a bad format but it is heavily compressed and is lost format so you do miss open some of the actual quality from the original recording one thing about mp3 is they don't take a huge much space so if your phone doesn't have a lot of storage you can put a lot of music on there without worrying about fill in the four-note that's one problem you won't have with the Xperia z5 come to 32 gigabyte onboard storage will take a further 200 gigabytes of memory with a expansion slot with a micro SD card I've got 128 gigabyte SD card in there meself and I'm about 80% full on that in the majority of it would be music again the majority without being high risk not everything that you have in your music collection would be of the urban high res as it's still a relatively new format but more and more music labels are getting onto it as well and some music subscriptions are starting to supplying music in high res for screaming so it is becoming a bit more mainstream than what it was getting onto audio onto the phone and the phone itself has a front-facing stereo speakers for listening and music without the pair of headphones or Bluetooth speaker if you haven't got any available and good for sharing music with your friends or videos but not something that you're gonna be doing all the time they do pack a little bit of punch which is okay for example if I just press play on the truck iPod and there see make bit of print on there and massive just going to be until high-res truck pull your little music widget at the top for you got your album or your buck skip pause which is also player on before wide strip and therefore you pause that though connect them be form to other devices is dead easy to do on the Xperia z5 because it uses NFC and a lot of their music devices later that Bluetooth speakers which can see behind or NFC enabled you can do one to sharing so if I was to skip the track again pick another one and just press play you have the music coming through the phone again using the stereo speakers if I just cut fall on to Bluetooth speaker they will say it's connecting to look and it's now coming through the Bluetooth speaker that easy to do so readjust for those quick sharing moments again this is totally portable and got a rechargeable battery and it just charges by unmei going in wesberry attract good even just poor Harlan to and it would have broken megaphone look great sound not a high-risk weekend but it is only about 60 pounds to like parks a great little punch for the size of the speaker that's the maximum volume with a general here I know sounds girls just or fair bit when maximum volume on the speaker I've never tender listen to our top songs volleys untouchable again to disconnect as you can see there so it's disconnected from the speaker high res audio is available from few set subscribers for example download a lot of my music from a website called kubarz which allows me to download it in more different formats I use pluck which is a lossless format so much better quality than what you will get with your standard mp3 and they're also in 24-bit which is true high res audio and the music itself that I get from that website allows me to share it so there is no music written on there so I can set this ring toward I can set it share it via bluetooth and say there is no restriction on what I can and can't do with my audio like what you would get with for example iTunes which is heavily restricted on what you can and can't deal with your own music and as you can see the back I've got a pair of Sony headphones those are the sony MDR one is which are high res certified so perfect when playing my high res audio tracks and come with two cables in the box one with an inline mic and one without this is the one with okay well let's get your typical I'll bracket three-and-a-half milord your drug looks to it into the phone at the top and it even tells you when you've got a pair of headphones connected you do have an option in which you can set on the phone to automatically stop playing music once the headphones are connected it's a great feature if you don't want to get your phone out your pocket and start shuffling around with the truck it will just pick up and play where you left off the headphones are sublime in terms of quality the build quality all audio quality or equally matched and in terms of overall lightness you can wear them easy for a good couple of hours and not really no other there they do it with too much but they're not overly light weather would feel cheap and plasticky as you can see you can adjust the cups 40 mil HD drivers on their which are perfect if you like a little bit extra bass music only set five is controlled through the music app which was originally called woman a lot of people including South were a little bit disappointed when song you remove the walkman Brandon from the experience it's been around for 40 years so it's well-established but you know times move on and you've got to go with it flow music in the face of the actual up itself it's quite straightforward you've got you play cue recently played newly added and that's all you've got in your SD card are an eternal memory as well you know when you listen in to a high res truck on these at five that you will say you get the high res logo which you can see right there right where my film is and that just allows you to know when you've got high risk racks on the go there it's laid out from the side you get a few different options so who play cue artists albums songs for us pianist or network podcast sentence and help sentence allows you to change a few things for example like an equalizer for example going to audio sentence to sound effects so equalizer which I've got set accustomed but you can't change it and define your own music test few things you've got the lighter stereo sound for front-facing speakers automatic optimization which is just the quality for whatever had to and you're using doesn't necessarily Sony branded the main part is phone is customization when it comes to audio you can change a lot of things to make this phone suit your needs when it comes to audio and that's why I think it's perfect it's not always always about music quality which is phenomenal on this device it is 10 out of 10 straight away highly recommended if you're after high quality phone which you want to put your music on but in terms of user interface it's the best out there as well you can see rhetoric trucks so for example to come out and just hit their search and type in food figures and look six albums or the Foo Fighters on there and again a few higher res tracks from them as well so the sonic highways and again in high res dead easy dead straightforward if you're after a new phone which you want to be playing music on and you want to get the best out of it and not worry about storage get yourself the Xperia z5 it's best in class their smartphone and plus and the best out there in terms of form music and even camera as well highly recommended it full of ten out of ten from me so if you like

98,cNlb9nDX9Ak,Steve May,UCZTvXIduuo22WAgnjMCF44A,Sony UHP-H1 Hi-Res Audio Blu-ray player UNBOXING,"In this video I unbox the UHP-H1, Sony’s new premium audio video player, and offer some first impressions. Is this the last great Blu-ray player from Sony before it introduces its first 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray deck? The UHP-H1 is as much a High-Res Audio player as a Blu-ray spinner. It’s compatible with all key audio codecs as well as Super Audio CDs and DVD-Audio. It’s also packed with cutting edge picture processing technology and will upscale regular Blu-rays to 2160p resolution.

The Sony UHP-H1Blu-ray player unboxed..

Who needs 4K? says Sony. Have this fancy audiophile Blu-ray player instead.

0.12: This is the Sony H1. In this plain white package is a Sony H1. It’s not in the standard retail package. That’s because this is an early sample shipped from Sony Japan.  It’s a plain white box with a cryptic message. No idea what it means.

0,33: Everything on the inside though is what you’ll get when you buy one.

0.42: The player comes with a standard infra red remote controller, which is a bit of a relief. There’s no trackpad to master and you get proper rubber buttons, including one dedicated to Netflix. 

0.50: The power lead is captive, which you can see is a bit of a nuisance.

0.56: As this is an early sample, the instruction booklet a photocopy. 


1.20: Let’s take a look at the back panel. There’s Ethernet, twin HDMI outputs, plus digital audio, and a pair of stereo phonos. 

The two HDMIs are for separate audio and video use, to maximise sonic performance. Notice the stereo phonos are widely spaced, so you can use chunky, high quality cables.


1.45: The finish on the deck is great. You have to go back to the old Sony ES model from 2009 to find something is well crafted as this. The top panel is made from a textured ABS, and has a really premium feel.

1.57: Obviously there’s Wi-Fi on board, in fact it has two aerials in a Mimo configuration. It’s also got Bluetooth. The Bluetooth module is behind the Sony badge on the fascia, the Wi-Fi aerials are to the right.

2.13: There’s a badge to show this is part of Sony’s hi-Res Audio family Love that finish.

2.20: Flip the deck over, you’ll see that there are four anti-vibration feet. Look closer and you’ll see they sit on embossed ribs which offer additional isolation. Attention to detail is great. 

2.33: Build quality is a big improvement over regular Sony Blu-ray players. The deck is built around a Frame Beam Chassis, see the two vertical beams that keep things rigid?

2.50: File support across a network is good. The deck will play MKVs, FLAC and DSD.  The disc transport is universal, and can play both SACDs and DVD Audio, in addition to all the usual disc formats.

3.03: The H1 may not play 4K discs, but there’s no shortage of streaming apps – including Netflix, Amazon, BBC iPlayer, YouTube and Spotify. 

3.15: There’s a tonne of picture processing on board, including a new 16-bit version of Super bit mapping. This is Sony technology to remove colour banding.

This isn’t intended to be a review, but I will say picture and audio quality are fantastic on this player.

3.50: The deck upscales to 2160/60 with 4:4:4 colour. Upscaled 4K picture quality is outstanding. 

3.56: There’s also Sony’s own movies on demand service, as well as PlayStation Now. Yes, the deck really does work with a Dual Shock controller.  

4.05: So that’s the UHP-H1. I think it’s a little bit brilliant. It may not be UHD but it’s the best Sony Blu-ray player for ages and gives an idea what Sony’s first 4K deck will actually be like, as the same dev team are working on it.

99,W8zfd52RtPk,ANA[DIA]LOG,UCaBStRQQh2sN2K_Ay-uXwUA,Blu-ray Audio: still worth it?,"Blu-ray is best known for its high-definition video but, since 2013, it is also used as a high-resolution pure stereo and sorround audio medium (linear PCM). Some high-res versions of famous albums are released ONLY in Blu-ray. Is this last high-res physical format just an audiophile fantasy or is it still worth it today?

High quality Blu-ray Players (just a few examples):
- Oppo BD-105D, BD-205 (discontinued but available in the used market)
- Pioneer Elite players
- Cambridge Audio
- Panasonic

10:14:19.269165, hi guys welcome back to Ana dialogue the dialogue on analog music reproduction today we're gonna take a look at another special digital format as you know every once in a while we take a look at a little digital aspect regarding high fidelity regarding high quality audio music reproduction and today we're gonna take a look at blu-ray audio pure blu-ray audio what is it does it still make sense to talk about it let's take a look go okay guys so today we're gonna talk about blu-ray audio forget all the movies forget all the cartoons anything that regards video we're not talking about blu-ray video forget about that we're talking about audio only pure audio only blu-ray discs what are these well after DVD audio super audio CDs different kinds of formats connected to CDs we also we did take a look actually to a few of these take a look for example at this link here for DVD audio which i think is one of the best types of high-resolution digital media we that we have that we used to have now we don't have anymore now blu-ray audio pure audio is something different I think it's something special for a few reasons first of all most of us have a blu-ray player in our homes so you do not need a dedicated player that was one of the main issues connected to DVD audio I've earned I know that they were incredibly expensive or for super audio CDs that was another huge issue a lot of people could not listen to a super audio CD because you needed a dedicated player so finally in around 2013 first Sony but also Universal mainly release the series of T titles connected to this new format actually not that new because as you know it is it was and it is still the best format for home video although things are changing now it's streaming in fact I think that with streaming services obviously for video like Netflix but I'm far from that I'm talking about our audio so if we're talking about audio immediately we think about Qaboos or title or things like that which are delivering high resolution audio so what is the point to go back to this format why is blu-ray all your only discs are still produced today because they're still in production in contrast with the other formats that we took a look in the other videos I did on digital this one is still in production and there must be a reason let's take a look why okay guys so I actually mmm I was kind of shocked because when I reached for my blu-ray audios only I did not imagine I had so many and these are just a few that I have here and a few of these are very good like this one Ellen Lewis this is very good other ones like this one of Marvin Gaye not that much and this was something IVD Utley noticed this one of Neil Young so so this one of Serge Gainsbourg I love him I have a Philips CD which i think is just as good or maybe it's better Allman Brothers live this was a good addition also because it is greatly expanded and its high resolution they also did additions like this Sam Cooke nothing there I mean this is just the CD reversed here I think this one by Stevie Wonder very good addition now I think this is a very good addition so there are some good choices out there this one's this is easy these high-quality recordings like Diana Krall are immediately all ready when they're born and conceived very high quality just as the ones like Patricia Barbour like again this one of our Bob Marley yeah so so nothing special whoo Quadrophenia good I mean I wouldn't go and hunt for it this one too so so other rock additions like yes someone else like Tom Petty unfortunately he died but before dying he really believed in in in blu-ray another person who greatly believed in this format is which by the way this isn't that good I mean it's good it's a little better than the CD just a little teeny bit another person that greatly believed and still believes actually in this format is Neil Young oh boy I mean he released all his catalog practically and the old recordings he had stored in his archive and he's releasing them all on blu-ray so if you're interesting going hunt for them another positive point about blu-ray is that you can find classic classical recordings classical music recordings that sometimes are a little difficult to find and these are very very good like for example something like this whoa this is part of this special label to L this is a Norwegian label this does it there's only extremely high-resolution quality music recordings not only in the blu-ray but also in DSD mqa Excel etc etc the good part of this is that like for example in this case I think it's cool this edition for example of this and this happens often I must say in several releases you have the blu-ray plus the super audio CD now that is I think it's it's cool because I forgot to say this and I said this in the beginning blu-ray is PCM pulse code modulation it's exactly the same type of audio as a CD only at a higher resolution in contrast with super audio CD which is instead as we know DSD so actually a high resolution of blu-ray is practically identical to that found on a DVD audio ok it's very similar and also the maximum resolution is identical because DVD audio and blu-ray can go all the way up to at least for now 24 bits per 192 kilohertz sampling rate that's the top of the tops and not every dition has that it depends so take a look so I think that having um two two versions of the C two versions of of an album is very cool also to do a comparison one is a super audio CD in this case and one is a blu-ray disc one is PCM one is DSD and I think that's that's pretty nice I mean because maybe you have a better super audio CD player maybe you have a blue a but a better blu-ray player it depends so if you have something like that it's easy to change in that way but also other recordings a little more anonymous we have all this pure audio selection I think it's a German label they're doing a lot of classic classic music recordings classical music recordings and what is another cool part here we can see other releases by that Norwegian label again as they do super audio CD and blu-ray see the Nordic sound and what is one of the main reasons why to choose this well the main reason is surround if you are interested in having high resolution audio multi-channel then you want these you desperately want these because your or dvd ologist obviously because otherwise or super audio CDs but otherwise if you're relying on high-resolution streaming services like gobos and title etc etc you're not gonna have a 5.1 DTS unfortunately but only the stereo version I am a stereo guy I like only two channels but I understand that a lot of people with a good player and a brand proper software like this you do want a full surround signal like that and this is high-resolution and actually a lot of important bands are releasing their their new albums if you want a physical album but high-resolution this is the way to go now today like Pink Floyd but also the last fantastic release of Abbey Road for example I have obviously the analog version but I also got this anniversary edition of with digital and yes you can find the high-resolution version of this on Kobo's for example but you cannot find the dolby atmos version yes dolby atmos which i mean that's the new frontier of music by Dolby and it is rather amazing I mean I had did some some tests and maybe will do a video on it with my smartphone and I must say it it is pretty impressive I mean the the music comes from different points and that's very cool obviously that's gonna work with it better best with a new recording not with the the four eight or whatever tracks they they were recorded on tape of the Beatles but again I mean that's cool to have Dolby Atmos DTS HD master audio 5.1 etc Sarah I mean that's one of the main reason why you would like to go for these otherwise there aren't that many solutions if you are interested in that so that's the main reason why I would recommend to go and find go and fetch these albums which you can easily find on Amazon just type blu-ray audio pure audio sand think that and you'll find lots of editions as I said in the beginning though not all of these are good only a few ok one last thing I want to say which is very important again maybe I should have said this in the beginning you need to look for a blu-ray player capable of dealing of converting the converted the chip you have must be able must be capable of dealing with a high resolution signal because obviously the normal blu-rays with movies on it they don't need that high resolution audio there's not there's no more space actually for also high resolution audio so you have to look at the specs and check if your blu-ray player or the one you want to buy is capable of dealing with that signal for example I know that the most of the pioneers the players are very very good the best of the best I think was Apple Apple unfortunately is out of the game but their players are still out and about I mean you can find them used or new old stock and eBay cetera so look from if if you're interested in having a multiplayer because the apples can play DVD audio super audio CD is the blu-rays I mean CDs obviously HD CDs anything that's why I have one and I love it but I know that for example even own donkey o has good players you have to check around I'll put some some references and links here below in the video description ok guys I hope you enjoyed this video please leave your comments please your suggestions for good blu-ray recordings I'm interesting that and hope to see you soon remember apart from all of this stuff music is born analog well guys if you're enjoying my videos and you're enjoying my

Is this the last great Blu-ray player from Sony before it introduces its first 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray deck? The UHP-H1 is as much a High-Res Audio player as a Blu-ray spinner. It’s compatible with all key audio codecs as well as Super Audio CDs and DVD-Audio. It’s also packed with cutting edge picture processing technology and will upscale regular Blu-rays to 2160p resolution.

The Sony UHP-H1Blu-ray player unboxed..

Who needs 4K? says Sony. Have this fancy audiophile Blu-ray player instead.

0.12: This is the Sony H1. In this plain white package is a Sony H1. It’s not in the standard retail package. That’s because this is an early sample shipped from Sony Japan.  It’s a plain white box with a cryptic message. No idea what it means.

0,33: Everything on the inside though is what you’ll get when you buy one.

0.42: The player comes with a standard infra red remote controller, which is a bit of a relief. There’s no trackpad to master and you get proper rubber buttons, including one dedicated to Netflix. 

0.50: The power lead is captive, which you can see is a bit of a nuisance.

0.56: As this is an early sample, the instruction booklet a photocopy. 


1.20: Let’s take a look at the back panel. There’s Ethernet, twin HDMI outputs, plus digital audio, and a pair of stereo phonos. 

The two HDMIs are for separate audio and video use, to maximise sonic performance. Notice the stereo phonos are widely spaced, so you can use chunky, high quality cables.


1.45: The finish on the deck is great. You have to go back to the old Sony ES model from 2009 to find something is well crafted as this. The top panel is made from a textured ABS, and has a really premium feel.

1.57: Obviously there’s Wi-Fi on board, in fact it has two aerials in a Mimo configuration. It’s also got Bluetooth. The Bluetooth module is behind the Sony badge on the fascia, the Wi-Fi aerials are to the right.

2.13: There’s a badge to show this is part of Sony’s hi-Res Audio family Love that finish.

2.20: Flip the deck over, you’ll see that there are four anti-vibration feet. Look closer and you’ll see they sit on embossed ribs which offer additional isolation. Attention to detail is great. 

2.33: Build quality is a big improvement over regular Sony Blu-ray players. The deck is built around a Frame Beam Chassis, see the two vertical beams that keep things rigid?

2.50: File support across a network is good. The deck will play MKVs, FLAC and DSD.  The disc transport is universal, and can play both SACDs and DVD Audio, in addition to all the usual disc formats.

3.03: The H1 may not play 4K discs, but there’s no shortage of streaming apps – including Netflix, Amazon, BBC iPlayer, YouTube and Spotify. 

3.15: There’s a tonne of picture processing on board, including a new 16-bit version of Super bit mapping. This is Sony technology to remove colour banding.

This isn’t intended to be a review, but I will say picture and audio quality are fantastic on this player.

3.50: The deck upscales to 2160/60 with 4:4:4 colour. Upscaled 4K picture quality is outstanding. 

3.56: There’s also Sony’s own movies on demand service, as well as PlayStation Now. Yes, the deck really does work with a Dual Shock controller.  

4.05: So that’s the UHP-H1. I think it’s a little bit brilliant. It may not be UHD but it’s the best Sony Blu-ray player for ages and gives an idea what Sony’s first 4K deck will actually be like, as the same dev team are working on it.

101,W8zfd52RtPk,ANA[DIA]LOG,UCaBStRQQh2sN2K_Ay-uXwUA,Blu-ray Audio: still worth it?,"Blu-ray is best known for its high-definition video but, since 2013, it is also used as a high-resolution pure stereo and sorround audio medium (linear PCM). Some high-res versions of famous albums are released ONLY in Blu-ray. Is this last high-res physical format just an audiophile fantasy or is it still worth it today?

High quality Blu-ray Players (just a few examples):
- Oppo BD-105D, BD-205 (discontinued but available in the used market)
- Pioneer Elite players
- Cambridge Audio
- Panasonic

10:14:19.589359, hi guys welcome back to Ana dialogue the dialogue on analog music reproduction today we're gonna take a look at another special digital format as you know every once in a while we take a look at a little digital aspect regarding high fidelity regarding high quality audio music reproduction and today we're gonna take a look at blu-ray audio pure blu-ray audio what is it does it still make sense to talk about it let's take a look go okay guys so today we're gonna talk about blu-ray audio forget all the movies forget all the cartoons anything that regards video we're not talking about blu-ray video forget about that we're talking about audio only pure audio only blu-ray discs what are these well after DVD audio super audio CDs different kinds of formats connected to CDs we also we did take a look actually to a few of these take a look for example at this link here for DVD audio which i think is one of the best types of high-resolution digital media we that we have that we used to have now we don't have anymore now blu-ray audio pure audio is something different I think it's something special for a few reasons first of all most of us have a blu-ray player in our homes so you do not need a dedicated player that was one of the main issues connected to DVD audio I've earned I know that they were incredibly expensive or for super audio CDs that was another huge issue a lot of people could not listen to a super audio CD because you needed a dedicated player so finally in around 2013 first Sony but also Universal mainly release the series of T titles connected to this new format actually not that new because as you know it is it was and it is still the best format for home video although things are changing now it's streaming in fact I think that with streaming services obviously for video like Netflix but I'm far from that I'm talking about our audio so if we're talking about audio immediately we think about Qaboos or title or things like that which are delivering high resolution audio so what is the point to go back to this format why is blu-ray all your only discs are still produced today because they're still in production in contrast with the other formats that we took a look in the other videos I did on digital this one is still in production and there must be a reason let's take a look why okay guys so I actually mmm I was kind of shocked because when I reached for my blu-ray audios only I did not imagine I had so many and these are just a few that I have here and a few of these are very good like this one Ellen Lewis this is very good other ones like this one of Marvin Gaye not that much and this was something IVD Utley noticed this one of Neil Young so so this one of Serge Gainsbourg I love him I have a Philips CD which i think is just as good or maybe it's better Allman Brothers live this was a good addition also because it is greatly expanded and its high resolution they also did additions like this Sam Cooke nothing there I mean this is just the CD reversed here I think this one by Stevie Wonder very good addition now I think this is a very good addition so there are some good choices out there this one's this is easy these high-quality recordings like Diana Krall are immediately all ready when they're born and conceived very high quality just as the ones like Patricia Barbour like again this one of our Bob Marley yeah so so nothing special whoo Quadrophenia good I mean I wouldn't go and hunt for it this one too so so other rock additions like yes someone else like Tom Petty unfortunately he died but before dying he really believed in in in blu-ray another person who greatly believed in this format is which by the way this isn't that good I mean it's good it's a little better than the CD just a little teeny bit another person that greatly believed and still believes actually in this format is Neil Young oh boy I mean he released all his catalog practically and the old recordings he had stored in his archive and he's releasing them all on blu-ray so if you're interesting going hunt for them another positive point about blu-ray is that you can find classic classical recordings classical music recordings that sometimes are a little difficult to find and these are very very good like for example something like this whoa this is part of this special label to L this is a Norwegian label this does it there's only extremely high-resolution quality music recordings not only in the blu-ray but also in DSD mqa Excel etc etc the good part of this is that like for example in this case I think it's cool this edition for example of this and this happens often I must say in several releases you have the blu-ray plus the super audio CD now that is I think it's it's cool because I forgot to say this and I said this in the beginning blu-ray is PCM pulse code modulation it's exactly the same type of audio as a CD only at a higher resolution in contrast with super audio CD which is instead as we know DSD so actually a high resolution of blu-ray is practically identical to that found on a DVD audio ok it's very similar and also the maximum resolution is identical because DVD audio and blu-ray can go all the way up to at least for now 24 bits per 192 kilohertz sampling rate that's the top of the tops and not every dition has that it depends so take a look so I think that having um two two versions of the C two versions of of an album is very cool also to do a comparison one is a super audio CD in this case and one is a blu-ray disc one is PCM one is DSD and I think that's that's pretty nice I mean because maybe you have a better super audio CD player maybe you have a blue a but a better blu-ray player it depends so if you have something like that it's easy to change in that way but also other recordings a little more anonymous we have all this pure audio selection I think it's a German label they're doing a lot of classic classic music recordings classical music recordings and what is another cool part here we can see other releases by that Norwegian label again as they do super audio CD and blu-ray see the Nordic sound and what is one of the main reasons why to choose this well the main reason is surround if you are interested in having high resolution audio multi-channel then you want these you desperately want these because your or dvd ologist obviously because otherwise or super audio CDs but otherwise if you're relying on high-resolution streaming services like gobos and title etc etc you're not gonna have a 5.1 DTS unfortunately but only the stereo version I am a stereo guy I like only two channels but I understand that a lot of people with a good player and a brand proper software like this you do want a full surround signal like that and this is high-resolution and actually a lot of important bands are releasing their their new albums if you want a physical album but high-resolution this is the way to go now today like Pink Floyd but also the last fantastic release of Abbey Road for example I have obviously the analog version but I also got this anniversary edition of with digital and yes you can find the high-resolution version of this on Kobo's for example but you cannot find the dolby atmos version yes dolby atmos which i mean that's the new frontier of music by Dolby and it is rather amazing I mean I had did some some tests and maybe will do a video on it with my smartphone and I must say it it is pretty impressive I mean the the music comes from different points and that's very cool obviously that's gonna work with it better best with a new recording not with the the four eight or whatever tracks they they were recorded on tape of the Beatles but again I mean that's cool to have Dolby Atmos DTS HD master audio 5.1 etc Sarah I mean that's one of the main reason why you would like to go for these otherwise there aren't that many solutions if you are interested in that so that's the main reason why I would recommend to go and find go and fetch these albums which you can easily find on Amazon just type blu-ray audio pure audio sand think that and you'll find lots of editions as I said in the beginning though not all of these are good only a few ok one last thing I want to say which is very important again maybe I should have said this in the beginning you need to look for a blu-ray player capable of dealing of converting the converted the chip you have must be able must be capable of dealing with a high resolution signal because obviously the normal blu-rays with movies on it they don't need that high resolution audio there's not there's no more space actually for also high resolution audio so you have to look at the specs and check if your blu-ray player or the one you want to buy is capable of dealing with that signal for example I know that the most of the pioneers the players are very very good the best of the best I think was Apple Apple unfortunately is out of the game but their players are still out and about I mean you can find them used or new old stock and eBay cetera so look from if if you're interested in having a multiplayer because the apples can play DVD audio super audio CD is the blu-rays I mean CDs obviously HD CDs anything that's why I have one and I love it but I know that for example even own donkey o has good players you have to check around I'll put some some references and links here below in the video description ok guys I hope you enjoyed this video please leave your comments please your suggestions for good blu-ray recordings I'm interesting that and hope to see you soon remember apart from all of this stuff music is born analog well guys if you're enjoying my videos and you're enjoying my

h wa less with the codec and makes and one of the wonders that this model incorporates m 11 pro is that it has a memory of up to 64 gigabytes since this makes me very happy because I love to store and store and store as far as the external memory I had already commented that it only has one slot because at apparently there were people who had complained a bit about the use of the dual slots that the previous models had and with this slot external in area principle up to use cards up to 2 terabytes to do the sound check I'm going to use my precious camps yesterday Andromeda c's that I love and let's see how it sounds when asked to apply cold music and I'm going to select Rosalía to try to see how I can comment from the outset that it shows that the quality is high resolution in addition has hxd technology has this stroke pro pro pro sound and have made an excellent job in eliminating noise good to start tell you that They come with an equalizer with which you can play a good time with them and the truth is that it has produced a rather juicy sound having counted power they needed to also connect them to the naming player dt 1770 that has 250 years and the truth is that it worked very well with the low gain mode it was a lot more than enough and with the discharge also gave enough without reaching the al maximum volume but the sound that this model gives is more than enough say m-11 pro is quite a neutral clean sound very nuance but not too warm and i would also say it's like the perfect example of what cold amps might sound like ideally because the sound is very good the range of the lows and the mids are on the side a little more clear so it's not such a dark sound so warm even if you compare it with the date your phone of your iphone for example I would say that you will also find quite a difference in weight in the low range you like the warm sound, you still have to keep trying with more players and in the treble have less brightness than other models such as the q5 el soundstage is as spacious as the q5 and due to the good separation that has the truth is that the image is super accurate and multidimensional in summary that here in audio 46 we have been very happy with this m 11 pro Well, for several reasons it is true that they are 200 dollars more expensive than their model previous we are talking about 649 dollars it's a lot of money but now it sounds great the memory is much bigger and we are happy because we like connectivity we like applications we like that it has compatibility with the mq format so that we are going to have the studio quality directly if you like streaming if you like download high quality music and you are a joy to life basically because the The truth is that I said in this case, yes I trust, thank you very much friends of audio 46 for being here with us one more video and here I stayed with my uncle giving this audio office a little gear 46 see you soon friends [Music and"

Un baladeur HD Audio à 60 euros ! A quoi peut on s'attendre à ce prix là ?",24,23744,92.0,405.0,34.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uRcB5BfHalU/hqdefault.jpg,baladeur|hi res audio|dodocool,2020-10-07 10:14:19.589482," hi everyone, I'm spirou the wagon, the one welcome to the channel that dislocated the last time we had read a digital photo frame and everyone said nobody cares about the amended digital photo it's no longer really an object that is part of the modern technological landscape it is true that the arrival of a certain type of device in this case here the tablets can very quickly become outdated another type of device in this case so the digital photo vaults today we will test again a object which is a little bit in the same figure frame since it is a portable audio players and portable audio players have almost all been made redundant by the arrival of smartphones which are also capable of reading music but the big interest of this little dodo cool music player is that it is HD audio certified and capable of playing formats such as flac or dsd in absolutely impeccable quality in addition they do not cost that 60 euros is what you can really have a great sound for 60 balls is what today's test will try to determine its parts well their trial including immediately lunch box in this little device already the box is very pretty a we can see a blueprint of the player in silver edging like that on a matte black background, it's a snap, it's really that really quality player in any case at the packaging level we have a little autocool slogan here and then the fact that we are therefore lossless that is to say lossless audio 8 giga of memory it integrates this small walkman it may seem a bit pure lossless hi-fi since it is formats which are necessarily less compressed for example than mp3 but it is not dramatic since on the other side we learn among other things that you can put memory cards up to 256 giga the dac which team this device is actually a small dual sherbrooke chip processor heart which is totally dedicated to audio therefore something brand new that autocool has decided to aim for its walkman the autonomy announced at 30 hours in fact it's even more than that since I held on for the first time that I tested the autonomy a little more 32 hours goes about 32 hours and a quarter of an hour we will say so the hifi 1,192 km 124 bits and the screen which is a vga ass so 1,320 by 240 resolution to give you an idea of ​​the first iphones second and third generations, here we go, let's go to the bank sign immediately we immediately fall on the walkman which is well protected because there is foam on the back of the cover it's always a good sign the walkman is in a small bag plastic we are going to put here on the side here we have the charging cable and data transfer which is from micro usb usb 2 that's a bit of a shame I would have usb3 because the audio formats little or no compress take a lot of space and there unfortunately with this type of connector will not have super speed I would also have appreciated having usb type c but hey that's the way to do it with the micro usb in the occurrence and there is a little bit of dope under the foam block here namely the small warranty card and the small manual I don't know if it is multilingual I do not believe one it is only exclusively in English ah if sorry it there are languages ​​yeah but it's just the technical specifications here yeah menu button previous take replay lcd with the small diagram so good you will not go very far with that but the walkman anyway normally a walkman it is taken in hand like that so needs the manual is that the interface is poorly done so I hope that this will not be the case yesterday their first good news when we release the small player in its box is that it is very qualitative despite its low price since it is entirely in aluminum here at the back it is aluminum here preceded the aluminum on the sides it is of aluminum the buttons are in aluminum here on the same front and the button central also here the only thing that is not in aluminum it is the screen which is really in a plexiglass but which has looks pretty sturdy and then the scroll wheel here which does a lot think of that of the first to the ipods one those who did not yet have the dial touch of yesteryear the little clicks and this one is made of rubber she is not hard plastic but rubber I don't know why they did not make hard plastic vinyl-like what evokes vinyl is rather the central part here but overall we are still on something that is a very very very neat design So in addition to the screen on the front panel and this famous dial with the button central which clicks we have a previous button a menu button a button next song and previous songs that are find that here arranged on the sides it is quite well done we sail without too many problems but badly blind when you go the walkman in your pocket between these different songs the sound volume is adjusted here so on the side on the top we have the connection to connect his headphones obviously it is important it is important because this player does not bluetooth despite the fact that the chip which integrates it is normally able to do it but many of whom chose it not to put technology certainly for precisely preserve this lossless audio side so thanks to the fact that we are wired we also have an output for hi-fi systems which therefore allow me to imagine capturing the sound that comes out of this walkman to take it out either on larger equipment or for possibly saving it is a good idea because you should know that the headphone outputs are ready amplified and not the linings outputs like that which they will be connected to an amp so it is always better to leave the amp do the job of a small walkman preamp that will always be less effective obviously we have the power button here on the top below we have the micro usb connection so the reset which is also a microphone because this player a small dictaphone function which is frankly not terrible when I go even recorded a file so that you can listen to it later but don't expect too much we are really on a microphone very cheap and therefore the famous port for microsd cards up to 256 guys see the bomb now listen to the owner's culture we gonna be able turn on the bouzin well then I will first show you the boot time will press the power button for three seconds and beware, here you have seen that it is extremely fast in a few only seconds we are ready to listen to his music the interface is rather well done since we recalled the dial here on the right side and the icons which are arranged in an arc and there is more than to gently turn the small dial to access the different icons so now playing is the music you are playing to simply listen to the playlist is the list of songs you go listen to fm radio to listen to fm radio the real fm radio we cannot listen to webradios anything else like that because there is no way to connect to a network on this device the dictaphone function here which therefore allows you to record your voice and the file explorer which does not allow you to navigate in the different media present in the device caution the device cannot read the videos only the music and therefore the voice files that you would have recorded as to the settings they allow to go to the different settings of the device so we will start by taking a little look precisely at the possible settings the interface it is customizable it are two different styles the playstyle showed you quickly here it is a style more neon blue the arrangement of the icons change but the principle remains exactly the same I like the interface better so I find it has a little retro feel that goes well this kind of portable players so here it is and which will appeal to audiophiles because it is more reminiscent of vinyl records the basic settings so it's going to be the screen saver contrast and brightness of the device times that of harnes knows how long before the device goes into standby all alone volume is the sound volume when the device starts up every quest they are the keys to their mug whoever they actually are the keys actually allow this party menu to ensure that the keys work even when the device goes to sleep or not there are people who prefer that the keys this block when the device is on standby which means that well they are unlikely to do a false manipulation of the feet of people who will prefer it to work because so that they can save battery and keep browsing the songs with the screen being so that will really be the preference of each information is information about the device, in particular the version of the firmware that you have there the quantity of available spaces which remains on the device and so on here we can change the language is of course put yourself in French if you wish, even if I do not recommend it because the translation is still rather approximate here I think we had done the tour no there was still something that seem initial live it is a reset cure but the device in configuration of the sinn sail well in this is what you will see the screen when you are in playing music here at the top left the sound volume the position in the playlist whether or not we repeat the different songs whether or not we normalize the sound volume the selection we made in the corners the graphic isr here for example she saw it weighs down the bass what I use myself because I use small earbuds that do not have frankly very good bases so it allows to increase them here and of course the remaining battery life on the left you can see the the album when it is available otherwise a little animation that I will give you show in a moment the sound quality that we are to listen to the cdu mp3 so it's not extraordinary the type of song the name of the album and it is here on the right and the bar of progression here at the bottom with the track we are listening to and the position in time and when I press the central button I switch to playback or pause that's when you listen to a song that has no cover you have a small animation of vinyl records that turns Who is my faith rather sympathetic and that is rather fun you see that there I am reading a flac and you can see here in water that the audio quality is a little better obviously we can also read the sd on the other hand be careful with the dsd I tried read the most awesome format, i.e. 11 megabit per second it does not work finally the player reads it one he does not refuse to read it but that jumps to death on the other hand when you go a step below that is to say in 6 megabit per second there it passes and I think it is because of the memory RAM 1 there is only 1 mega bytes of RAM so when reading files that need 5 megabits per second it's still going but eleven mega it's just not enough it would have taken a lot to put a little more ram so here is if you are really a fan of goddesses of a11 megabit second will have to put 150 euros in a walkman a little more balèze but for all other formats absolutely all I had no problem the cool sleep read them all at the perfection and that's frankly fun and the more the sound is frankly of very good quality during playback when you press the menu key you access a number of settings additional such as being able to put the songs in the chance or in a specific order the famous repetition the allies let's go return in a moment to stage i mode which in fact allows each time that you press the buttons there not to skip to the previous song or next but to advance other 2 by small by small jumps of three seconds in an audio file which can be handy when looking for a specific passage of a recording for example repetition whether you want the songs to repeat or not the repeat interval etc and scanning mode which allows you to search for new sound files in the file tree of the device then the most interesting thing is going to be the what the isr obviously since you will have a choice between presets made in factory so there I had chosen to avoid everything the hour but you can also go to equalizer and customize your own your own settings like that screwed up pretty well see turning the wheel I can change the preamplification prelate and then the different frequencies so that's good because really you can make yours yours as you like and that I think that's really super cool so obviously I can't tell you to enjoy the sound quality of this player besides see there I have not even plug in the headphones but trust me it's really very clean the sound really comes out with amazing clarity mapad breath we don't have any distortion crackles at all it's really excellent the only problem of course is that to take advantage of it maximum well you will need a super good wired headset with jack so I want to say that this walkman is aimed at people who already have audio equipment in terms of headphones that holds up if you use small gameboy earbuds you are not really going to hear a glaring difference, for sure with a good wired headset this player really displays quality exceptional sound I used a headset that I had tested with you already that they collected in the 80 euros and already only with headphones like that we hear an incredible difference between mp3 and flac or sdc enough it's quite striking obviously if you are not audiophiles your portable telephone will be more than enough for you and I will not recommend buying this stuff there but if you really want to taste superior sound quality it can be a good investment though it is time to bring a conclusion to this video to give a rating to this product then obviously if you are not an audiophile and you are very happy with the audio quality of your smartphone do not buy this product it is obvious it is not for you that it is addressed by cons if you are an audiophile and you are very demanding on the sound quality including when you are on the move that's where it is kind of music players will really interest you because it must be said between an mp3 him on a smartphone and a flac or a ds elected on this device there there is absolutely no picture of this camera there but the misery to any smartphone at this level it's clear and clean even when we put an mp3 in this device we feel a loss of quality compared to puddles which is quite obvious so it is really the proof that this player holds the road and that it displays high quality sound quality not everything is perfect we can not read the dsd to may 11 guys which are extremely rare one anyway because the smallest album weighs between 1 and 3 giga so it's rare that we find formats audio this high is really for purists Mélissa si megabit per second without problem so we are not going to shoot the ambulance either, the walkman is quite suitable for audiophile use there is no problem i will remove it when even a half star first for its small audio incompatibility of course but also because dodo cool had the bad idea to put usb2 in micro usb on this device we would have preferred usb3 to usb type it is quite simply because when we carry around audio files that weigh several hundred mega we want to be able to put them in the walkman quickly and with such a low socket it will not be possible it will not be great slow will not be super fast either, it's a shame because it's a bit the only hard fault with perhaps also the quality of the microphone but hey it's not a dictaphone is an audio player so that in a pinch we could not take into account but hey it's usb2 I think it's a bit of a shame it's a bit the thing on a device like that they try to play it a little bit retro high tech I would have liked to have a modern plug rather than this plug which start a small one can be done via usb usb micro there good it was maybe not a good idea but apart from that there is not much to reproach this object so I'm going to give it a mark of four and a half out of five it is an excellent player at 60 euros it takes the dragee high at what costs more than double so yeah it's a good little object that I can only you recommend if I repeat you are a demanding audiophile and that you have among other things a very good helmet is there it was the test of this certified hd audio player from dodo cool if you have in your around an audiophile and you do not have the budget for him buy a music player from major brands have no fear, this one will largely as well for a lot less expensive I hope this video will help you will have rained and I tell you very soon for a next test come on jo"

a company that has been involved with apps for using on Android and maybe I devices I'm not sure I use it on Android and this is their first gap that they made a music player high quality other plays the highest quality files that you can get it's called the r6 this is the box that it comes in it's got stuff on the back it's using the ESS chip it's got three gigabytes of RAM it plays DSD natively it's got fast charge bluetooth Wi-Fi I'll get into specs later this is the Box take off the box it's got a cover because boxes have covers that's an absolutely outstanding cover it's got foam perhaps the finest foam I've ever seen in my life just messing with you guys um comes in plastic it comes with a party taking this out because I saw somebody else's video and they totally borked it and that dudes blocking me I think or whatever and whatever dude that was a lame video take this off now what would have would be a protective screen eat much rather look at like the stuff on my ceiling with you it's got a Chinese instructions if you Chinese I'm sorry this is aimed at a different audience it's got a single uh let me say the weight is like Sony the gold one this is very very heavy this is a very heavy device and I'll find out why later it's got one umm SD it's very flush machining is fantastic it's got a plus and minus button I that's got to be volume on the top it's got pretty much everything I guess it's got balanced it's got regular it's got line out it's got coaxial optical I guess if that if one of those is not in here I'll update later it's pretty much got everything so far as I know on the opposite side it's got three buttons for buttons excuse me this would be the power one this would be like next previous pause play I'm taking guesses right there push the power button down hold it and he's starting up God that the journey that this device went on is absolutely mind-blowing China messed up and then they passed it Japan who decided to keep it going with the messed up theme and just Joe Bloggs is five years older in the past three days dealing with me I'm an absolute nightmare people warned him don't deal with him I at least I know how to do a video man and we go as you can see I've already loaded my chick onto here swipe up now you got icon right here if you get this thing and it's in Chinese don't even sweat it touch this icon right here and now you get in and you want to go down until you see the globe symbol then you touch that and then at the very top you're gonna have an option and it'll be in Chinese or another language just touch it I'm not gonna do it now laughs it whatever touch it and then it's gonna give you all the languages they'll all be in Chinese but then you get down to the ones that are like English and you can pick English American English British whatever you want I'm using American because I'm an American get out of there so if you're familiar with Android you familiar what I'm doing so setting the language is very very very easy it's not a problem at all now hit this square because I want to get that out of memory completely and do this right there and that would be the screen that we're looking at here's your browser this is easy apk I believe is the name of it or something like that I'm not totally sure you can you can sum some AP keys are available something like Spotify you're gonna have to side load so this will be useful I guess go ahead and hit this this would be their app I've already loaded musical into it let me get to a known DSD okay that would be dark side of Moon now in here be if you touch right here this will show you what it is and if you touch it right here just will show you what it's actually doing and what this is actually doing is actually playing a DSD file natively right out of this stock player so this is the heavy r6 I'm gonna be doing a video I'll be taking pictures I'll give impressions I'll be doing lots of stuff it feels really really stout it's it's beautiful it's a it's absolutely stunning and it looks like it's playing DSD right out the box like a boss so that's an unboxing do you want to see the cables the guy that did the other video did that really you want to see the cables take this out you get the pin that goes with it so that you can take out the slider tray to put your stuff in it you've got this I don't know what this is just this cable it's USB cable this it's another USB cable like I said somebody else already did no video unboxing and it's got extra and extra cover so it's glad do this the beauty check it's a it's a stunner it's absolutely beautiful it's my stomach I'm starving sorry here you go no question whatsoever if this thing is playing DSD was resample or anything like that it is not this thing was built around that and I'll get into that more later Joe we did it we're both a couple years older but we did it it's an absolutely beautiful beautiful device beautiful it feels powerful it this is a very weighty machine I'm going to actually weigh it I'm losing my voice and I'm starving so I'm gonna go ahead and throw this on the net it's beautiful and I will give you guys impressions ask questions etc etc this is the r6 and I got it BAM more stuff coming later I'm gonna eat it finally made it what a story oh my god somebody's gonna get curlers tomorrow or I'm gonna get them I already got ribbons just just mind-blowing was totally worth the wait this thing is the thing is a brick of music playing absolutely awesome if wait were an indication then this would probably be like a $4,000 dab because it's that heavy and the build quality is absolutely fantastic brilliant brilliant brilliant job they did an awesome job oh that DST symbol this is all about playing DSD without anybody messing with you and that's a different color than before it's green so I don't know what the hell that means does that mean it's playing DSD I don't know it's awesome so far it's in my hand it feels awesome it's heavy it plays DSD and I'll be doing at least another couple of videos and a lot of stuff this is mine and I'm keeping it thank you very much Joe so opinions are coming let's get a look at her before we leave oh well playing another song and it's another one bit song I loaded all dsds on here because it's a DSD player pretty much everything else this thing eats for breakfast DSD that's what it's supposed to do God look at that that is actually a really beautiful screen see if I can get I'm just my boy all right to puck show some face there we go I don't think this is a flock no this is 96 32 that's probably the lowest quality that I have on this device right now most everything else is DSD it has 3 gigs of ram it is a very snappy device very snappy boom let's stop right there let's go with this that's got a beautiful get the screen quality what are we playing what are you playing oh it's another DSD being played natively come on now come on now"

Resolution MP3 Player|dodocool|AGPTEK|Bluetooth mp3 player,2020-10-07 10:14:19.589572, Livan tear OS reviews you're watching our hands-on review of the base play p3000 this is a hi-fi quality digital mp3 player that retails for $60 making it pretty inexpensive for something that has a built in DAC and also promises again high res quality in terms of music playback and a pretty decent construction quality now it comes with no built-in memory but the version we're checking out today has a free 16 gigabyte card included in the box which you can replace by your own capacity if you want a larger version so the whole point of getting a mp3 player in 2018 when most folks can already do the same functions on a smartphone is gonna be for that built-in DAC and high res capability which if you really care about the sound and he having some more expensive headphones to listen really closely it can definitely be worth while or if you want to go to the gym or take something ultra lightweight and I'll have to carry around your phone this is also a decent option to check out so this is what the packaging looks like most of the letters are in Chinese this is a company based in Shenzhen and on the back here we can see it has a battery capacity that's rated at roughly 20 playback hours we have the player right on top which will sit up closer look at in a second but first impressions would be it's a lot smaller than what the ads probably make it seemed like because it's cast at an angle but it's actually very lightweight about the same size as an older iPod Nano back in the day and in here we also have some free included earphones but these are not the best quality and obviously if you care about sound you would want to use your own here is the 16 gigabyte free micro SD card micro USB cable for syncing and charging takes about two hours to completely charge and there's also a carrying pouch to protect it when on the go this is not the first digital mp3 player that we've checked out from this company base play the last version that we did was the s5 which came out several months back but this is a budget oriented model which although supports lossless audio formats like flak does not have it built-in DAC or digital to analog converter so it's not quite as audiophile grade as something like this for plugging in more premium headsets and headphones but in terms of size and form factor it really is about the same as those other players that we've been checking out recently including the bass play as five over here which you can see that next to the p3000 is actually a really similar in terms of form-factor but we also have the placement of the keys on the side there's a power switch on here and what's different is instead of having a plastic key construction on the front as well as a traditional d-pad it's replaced by this scroll wheel on the side here that gives it a slightly more fancy and expensive look another quick size comparison with the Samsung p3 which we also did throwback review on just a few days ago also made out of aluminum but this one has a three inch display it also supports lossless audio formats like flak and finally with a modern smartphone and it looks absolutely tiny by comparison so you can tell that how portable it is to just slide into a pocket when you're on the go so a closer look at the hardware before we dive into the software it is very well constructed the entire thing is made out of cnc aluminum that is a unibody and feels extremely durable the frontier is also made out of glass and the controls have a nice tactile sensation to them as you're clicking the scroll wheel is a little bit too sensitive in my opinion but it has a nice click when you're scrolling along click look at the software next the first thing I want to point out is this side controls here are no longer acting as the volume keys instead they're acting as these skipped track controls so for instance or a plain back a song over here if I tap on this you can see that it's going to go over to the next track as opposed to changing the volume instead changing the volume is controlled using the scroll wheel I would actually prefer it was the other way around because if this player is just in your pocket I feel like it's easier to control the volume using mechanical keys as opposed to feeling your way using this wheel on the side the wheel is also a little bit sensitive so it can accidentally trigger a volume change if you just put it in two pockets or tighter jeans I also do wish that the placement of the keys were slightly more higher on the player or maybe if the display was on the bottom and the controls were on the top if you think about that it's kind of a strange design choice but it's because your hands are naturally holding it like this and so moving your thumb downwards to purposefully kind of change the volume and other controls is not the most organic thing in the world so the display on first impression seems fairly bright although because it has a reflective surface it still is a little bit difficult to see in direct sunlight but overall I like the color as well as the resolution seems just fine for a player like this it can display your album or information if available on the side here and this really is a dedicated muse player doesn't have any additional functions like watching movies or storing photos what I also like is after a few seconds the screen times out to conserve on battery they can still control things without having to turn the display back on so for instance as the display is off I can still be adjusting the volume and if I tap on the wake button again you can see that the volume has changed there otherwise I can tap on the back you here to basically go back into previous menus this is what the interface looks like as far as scrolling is concerned it's pretty smooth and responsive the screen here again has pretty good contrast and I like the orange and black theme I look I think that it looks pretty classy there's also the battery status in the top right hand corner and the volume settings on the left tapping on back once more returns us to the actual home screen which is displayed as a carousel of different functions so whether it's sorting your music by category and genres taking a look at all of your music at once going to settings to change them of the profiles and you can also favorite tracks to have it playback and a specific kind of playlist that you set using the player so it's all pretty intuitive to select on something you actually don't press down on the wheel or tap on play which is again takes a little bit of time to get used so you actually tap on the Menu key which can seem a little counterintuitive at first but you tap on it once to go in and from here you up to change languages create playlist changes screen brightness sleep timer things like that one of the benefits of having a player that's based out of China is it supports a lot of languages out of the box so you can play back songs if your titles are in Chinese or you are a fan of world music things like Spanish with accents many other mp3 players will fail to display those characters correctly and you'll have blocky text or random letters popping up if you're trying to playback a song in a different language bond here everything is actually displayed correctly we take a quick look at the equalizer settings next it's pretty cool because I can cycle through a few different modes if you want to you can create your own custom equalizer so for instance I want to tweak some of these sound properties so you can move this up you can move it down like that and also cycle between several different preset equalizers like rock this is what the sound signature is like by default this is pop music this is soft jazz classical techno and going back to the custom for music performance the most important thing of this player obviously it does first I'll support all the format's that it claims to on the box so I tried it out with flack which is a lossless audio formats that are supposedly better than CD qualities if you plug in decent headphones you lis do hear more detail with the sound now when it comes to the actual audio quality I was also again pretty impressed considering this is still a pretty low cost to pay for a high res audio certified player just a few years back I think the audiophile players were much more niche they're getting slightly more mainstream now but you just want to plug in some small lightly to your buds you can already get some pretty great sound using these it gets plenty of detail obviously dependent on the headphones you're testing them out with but I was again very impressed when doing a comparison with let's say an iPhone or iPod they were miles ahead in terms of clarity giving you deeper bass as well as more definition within the sound I know there are a few other low cost high res players in the market now one which is by dodoo cool that solves for about the same price it has a slightly larger two inch display but this version seems to have a stronger build quality which is completely made out of aluminum and since you're not watching videos on these things anyways a more compact form factor is in the end more beneficial I think just because it's easier to talk with you when you're traveling or on the go so you can check out more details about the bass play p3000 player in the links down below but for now that's been our video thanks for watching cure @os reviews that's been the p3000 hi-fi audio

--------------------------------
SMSL DP-3 is a unique product of its kind which is targeted for those audiences who have tons of unsorted offline High-Res audio at their local hard drive or home network attached storage. What I love this player about SMSL didn’t provide or limit the storage capacity like many premium brands do and charge the customer arms and legs for their proprietary eco-system. Where in this case of DP-3 the system is fully open. The approach is Bring your own storage we will help you to enjoy your tunes. At first when I came to know about this product I was pretty disappointed that all ports are at the back are output only and only input is Type-A USB, Micro SD and Micro USB (in DAC Mode) but later I realize DP-3 as stand as a dedicated source of an existing music setup and distribute music through Stereo Amp / Receiver or via Headphone Route all day without breaking sweat…. And boy it is extremely capable of doing its Job. As for today's norms, DP-3 can do any streaming service as via Bluetooth (tested Spotify/Amazon Prime Music) from phone or tablet but that can do by any cheap Apt-X BT streamer directly connected to the stereo receiver…Right? Well DP-3 shines when comes to play unorganized High Resolution (or Low Resolution) offline music files stored in the HDD which never see any action for a long time, now it is ready to play as matter seconds…. Thanks to Hiby Link to act as a remote control which will navigate music properties. People who love folder play and don’t have the time or care about playlist, find just right home with DP3. Needless to say this is the most used music device (as source) once it arrived. For the first time, I don’t need to charge any batteries after long usage or sorted music files and keep in check to the Micro SD card to load new files as I need to do my Hi-Res Daps. As of now only cons I found (1) In player time clock can’t read time or update itself from the Wi-Fi Signals (2) If the front LCD is off there is no way to know the player is running or not once the music stops, So there must be Power Indicator light helps or LED ring around volume control. (this is not a con) Speaking of volume control it can control the volume of the Line-Out port at the back so Power Monitor speaker can be connected which don’t have any volume control. Anyway, I don’t have any NAS so can’t comment on that, all the above from playing Hi-Res offline files from the HDD storage.

have to confess I am still and still out of it in terms of high res audio I don't understand where this is coming from now high res audio has been around it isn't new it started in the late 90s you know talking about as a consumer format started in late 90s with sa CDs and DVDs or do discs there was a lot of hoopla surrounding those format so they're gonna be the next big thing everybody's gonna get it on the CD is gonna die it cuz it's so old so it's so dated this is in late 90s early 2000s and yet and yet and yet despite all the promises and record companies are really committed to to high res I remember Warner Brothers in particular said DVD audio that is the future all these features you can read the lyrics you can look at pictures it any way they would they promised hundreds thousands of titles and they would triple out three or four at a time and then nothing would happen and eventually they gave up and they went away but now with files the whole thing about putting out hi-res music to people directly who want them it's way more possible there's no you know double inventory there's a physical media so sure it's great time to explore the wonders of high res but where is this high res I mean I remember when Neil Young was rolling out pono which is not 20 years ago but it's a while back now and he was saying oh it's the best the best thing and he got on all of his pals to just jump up for George I'm enjoy about how amazing high res is and they loved it and loved it and okay so where are the artists recording their music in high res well it it comes out now in dribs and drabs but most of it is called high res now is really you know standard CD resolutions in a digital resolution let's say is 16-bit 40 for one and a lot of weight comes out now that's high res is 24-bit for two for one or forty-eight a little better than CD but it ain't exactly what they were promising 20 years ago it's not it's not even as good as that so now the other thing about resolution to me my take on resolution means hearing the quieter parts of the recording you know like those horns and sirens outside my windows compared to the level of my voice they're there down in level I'm joking of course about this but you know in if they were truly people out there making high-res recordings to use the capabilities of high res you would hear more of the sound of the studio so me it was a bit sounding studio you want to or a good concert venue or a church or something like that you would hear the sound filling that space because that sound would be much lower in level than the sound of the actual instruments and singers right so you adhere the resolution down down down into the mix that's what resolution means to meet but resolution as it's used today is just a number like 96 24 or 192 24 or something like that oh yes it's in high res but since most rock pop or you know world music is very heavily produced records well maybe the vocal was recorded in 96 24 but then when they did the drums at another city or state or country or something they meant it might have been that at 44 1 and then the keyboards were in it later and then the and it's a reverb and the reverb itself was you know 192 so it's all this jumble of sources and where it all comes from and they can just see oh it's 192 you know when at one of the early proponents of high res audio I was talking about just that just just hey just take your standard resolution recording you know up sample it to be high res and then say it's high res I mean they were shameless about the loose definition of what a high res recording actually is and don't get me started on SACD or DSD like DST is really hard to edit masters a lot of times that's bumped over to PCM and then after it's edited they they could go back to to DSD again the the labels of what is called high res or in this case DSD they're just they're fluid there's no standard there because it doesn't mean anything it's just it's just three letters in this case DSD and if you know of any four times DSD recordings of any music that I Steve Guttenberg the audio feel like would want to listen to well let me know in any 10 times the SD recordings yeah I want to hear about all those because people seem obsessed with chasing these numbers they got to get higher res and higher res and higher as even though there's precious little high res being recorded by major artists that I would care about I don't know about you care about so it just seems like chasing there's a lot of chasing going on of this is the ghost of high res what is it what does it mean does it sound better you know it could but in the end to me the quality of a recording happens when it's being recorded and mixed right there the words the choices that were made early on the choices of what Mike was used on the vocals what mic we used on the trumpets what Mike was used on the marimba those make huge differences in the way the sound is initially captured if not originally captured it ain't measurably going to appear down the road because it's high res from any kind of restaurant so the choices in in microphones and how those microphones were positioned the choice is made by the engineers and along the way how that record was mixed the processing that was used and that'll I'm not saying about processing is bad but the processing and reverb and all sorts of things that happen to a recording from when it's initially being performed by human beings too as it's been mixed and mastered who knows but good things could happen and bad things can happen I am certainly not against mastering records and making them sound better than the original performances if that's possible I'm not being snarky about that so what is this high resolution that you talk about well you know what I think now I want to hear what you think and I want I want in your comments I hope to be specific about what you're hearing in high res and why you believe it to be truly high res and not just a label or a number saying that it is high res what do you hear from these high res recordings that you don't hear from standard 16-bit 4401 digital recordings what do those numbers or letters mean in terms of sounding better that's this that's the question for you guys what make what makes high resolution worth it if that's your fancy me well you guys might know I have an association a long association with Chesky Records which has been recording in high res for a very long time so I've heard high res going down Jesse doesn't record in Studios very much but they record in churches which is I needed to before where you can actually hear the sound filling a space and if there is no real mixing to a Chesky recording so pretty much what happened that the session goes on to the finished product so I've been around a lot of high res being recorded and I know what that is but a lot of people say oh but that's just or defiled stuff I don't care about that I got that's cool you don't have to like twenty five recordings that's fine I'm just saying I want to know where there are recordings made by non audiophile labels in high res and I am NOT talking about taking old analog tapes from before and then making them into DSD files or high res PCM that's kind of cheating cuz that's I mean it's good sound good but why not just listen to the records that were mastered from those analog tapes in the first place again you may sense my skepticism about high res at this point right so yeah if you're into high res and you're just listening to old analog recordings in DSD files or something you know good for you if you're enjoying it hey whatever floats your boat I'm not opposed to that I'm talking about recordings that start out as high resolution recordings stay high resolution through their mixing and mastering phases and what you're hearing and why you think that's better my name is Steve Guttenberg this is the audio fili AK daily show

volumio|sennheiser HD6xx,2020-10-07 10:14:19.589664, I'm a kind of person who likes to get the most out of their investment and this is exactly what I'm doing in this video I'm taking the heart and soul of the ultimate audio player 2.0 l the hifiberry dac+ pro board and modifying it to power the analog circuitry directly not through the PI I did read about it a while back but I just wasn't ready to touch a perfectly working DAC with a soldering iron right until a few weeks ago the modification itself is pretty simple as it comes down to the soldering a resistor and soldering cables or pins to connect the power I was a little anxious when removing the r14 resistor so I didn't film it not to jinx it but this turned out to be easy-peasy as I barely touched the element it pretty much came right off as far the power delivery I soldered a pair of wires which are later replaced with beans for convenience I also soldered a set of GPIO pins to connect the PI since I wanted to do a custom case with to PCBs placed next to each other if you haven't figured that out just yet touching a hifiberry board with a soldering iron equals instant loss of warranty so you're doing it at your own risk the case was designed in fusion 360 and printed in PDG on a trusty under three it has integrated standoffs and cutouts for all ports that I need RCA connectors power sockets Ethernet and USB I couldn't care less for the rest so it doesn't bother me at all that they are inaccessible the print came out decent although there was a slight issue with the standoffs alignment for the duct I tapped all mounting points and hoped for the best there was also a slight issue with the PI ports opening which was a little too small but I fixed that with a file I also designed and put the top cover which Dearing came out perfect but there's no such thing as a perfect prototype next I sliced a sheet of veneer that I got for this project it's a pretty funky looking one with a lighter and darker Brown and a touch of green here and there I send it a loose a little bit applied some glue a squeeze both together after 15 or so minutes I moved on to bending the veneer around the car I sprayed some water onto it and after waiting for a while I tried to model the veneer unfortunately the corner was too tight to make the bend so I came up with a plan B and design and printed corner pieces that will make the outline square I could have probably adjust the design and make the case more round but it didn't feel like wasting otherwise a very decent print I fixed all four with mom and her glue sanded surface a little bit and put filler in larger gaps next I sanded the filler down and proceeded with attaching the veneer applied contact glue on both the veneer and the plastic wall wait 10 minutes put the two together and clamped it after the glue has dried I kind of demeanor with utility knife and moved on to the next wall after doing all four and make openings at the back using utility knife and a round file to make the device audio file approved I got some aluminum tape to reduce any potential electromagnetic interference at least theoretically I do have an EMI meter and we'll have to test if this type does actually do anything I decided to represent PLA which should go better with the veneer for a very first print using this material it came out very good I attached a piece of filtering material to the bottom of the top cover to minimize the dust buildup inside I prepared a set of female-to-female cables to connect only essential GPIO pins and to power sockets one for the deck and the other one for the PI just for the kicks I printed my own logo send that the letters down and fix it up front with some glue with everything ready I proceeded with assembly first in when the dock held in place with a set of hex screws next I put in both bar sockets after that I chopped in the pie ended the wiring last but not least I fixed a set of rubber feet to the bottom surface but on the top cover and the ultimate I'll do player free point always complete software wise I'm still running Volumnia which isn't perfect but good enough for the time being there's one more very important thing I didn't mention yet power delivery in order to get the most out of your deck you will need a quality stabilized power supply I got mine from China for a little under $100 shipped it can deliver over three amps at five volts so it can easily power the pie and the DAC now did all that actually improve the sound quality yes it did I listened to a few of my favourite albums and could definitely hear the difference if you have the guts to void your warranty and a hundred dollars to spare for your power supply you should definitely consider modding your DAC thanks very much for watching and I'll see you in the next one

quality standard is completely sufficient I will briefly the video in the analog area start and then try to get along without physics and mathematics if possible the knowledge of the previous video that is linked up here in the infobox helps you guys so far but before we really start I have to drink up courage you know the comments would not be bad we already had the record in the cd audio standard back then as the cd has replaced the quarrel started that's so artificial and so on and so on in the dispute I want to go now do not interfere although i say my god we have no other problems well it doesn't matter first you have to accept that we are not electronic would like to process any data we would like to transfer to a computer so digitization has to be used back then the word digitization still has an effect clearly the meaning of analog digital converter is nice if some city administration goes online but that really works here way too far then this signal has to be arc of tension it could be more conceivable allah or - something like that beautiful curved - then it had to be scanned at regular times from a converter the converter is called ad converter analog digital converter der looks now and then what the tension recognized here here here do not do it continuously he has discrete evaluations you can measure me that analog that is there on the line and transmitted almost without any steps in the other area the dialogue is continuously transmitted digital slowly just that he must regularly sample the signal and then you have to make compromises with the cd you have decided 44,100 times the signal is scanned every second with a resolution of 16 bits we come and soon again remember that so far now you have to just accept it and that's just physics maths like it wanted to look like all you hear all sounds i can as a sum of sinus vibrations you only know vibrations yes that is none so i can reproduce every signal by adding a sum different sinus oscillate different events I've prepared something, you already have it now they're twelve kilohertz of which about five kilohertz now applies to it you everything that i build together here, so to speak, makes its little time disks from it and superimposed several sinus oscillations that is now important to know then you have to accept and that is Now actually the only premise where the experts will argue that the human ear lalala somewhere at 20 21 kilos no longer hears me somehow towards 16 kilohertz maybe different for you ok so we learned the ear goes up to 20 kilos and therefore mine I a sina oscillation on an analog record is natural everything on it that the artist has said is not natural also total nonsense because that was also post-processed in the best way fall in the good old days and there are also restrictions on the frequency range the frequency range belongs to from zero to exactly 20 khz also that was not with the full bandwidth in the analog time processed that's rubbish now it gets interesting now we have restrictions and people say aha moment when i have a sine of 20 kilowatts what some people still hear and the cd is from this converter only sampled with 44 kilohertz 44.1 khz but if I now here the 7 that if I don't even imagine now then you can find out relatively quickly that at the moment I have to be positioned in the picture that maybe then the two points of that the converter then maybe only two such points mist and these two points we should now this video audio signal generated that's rubbish they say Advocates now of all this about scanning theories yes there you have to does not work well and we come to that now let's deal with bus stops first that's far brought here but not let's imagine the scenario as follows yes so a bit difficult you have a bus stop want to know what the So the bus cycle is the cycle where the bus picks up people in our scenario is there a lot of wrong people go to la la la la la la but also think about if you could take a picture at regular intervals Because of these shifts of the people after a few ways there is something white I can tell you that there was consciously now we have to an example of a 15-minute bus cycle comes every 15 minutes look at the photo there and say yes the bus was there because of the change in people now you can Of course, with this too, take a picture every 15 minutes of a day of penance half an hour notice the change only in every second picture significant bus was there you can also use bus clocks that are slower find the canal 5 hours come if you see this sample often enough are now the ad converter that scans the bus but you have to stop Scan more often, in any case, more often than the bus comes when the bus has all five minutes come and you only take a picture every 15 minutes then you see there was there but it is nice but shorter there you get the other way Presentation of the bus was every 15 minutes because then you have a wrong bus cycle determined a wrong frequency an alias frequency as they say there on English is sr leisinger and now I know that there are now two points we are now difficult to get together exactly this problem occurs digital audio on your transducer that scans the signal now goes with 44,000 scan in the second to works but it can only sine up to 22 so the half just recognize the theorem according to the scan it has two points because he I still owed you the answer to that, believe me first as far as you can get to the rest when the frequency is high the sine shorter because then I mistake the converter and if you do However, if only once - then you can find out that I also let it be technically determined that it is really important get the wrong frequency and that's the worst thing in audio can happen that then leads to very bad effects and therefore has to happen before the signal is read in, a filter must be installed and he says just each other moment over 20 kilohertz sinus nobody comes in for me 22 Creation Too Further Let's take it for granted that we can make it that directly behind our microphone everything that is bigger than the beeper throw away over 20 kilohertz, the rest is a digital one signal processing and digital signal processing that then does this in the worst case two points out and now it goes but and now I express it and physically we know that no other can frequencies through these two points give except frequencies up to a maximum of 20 kilohertz can be reconstructed from these two points can be used to generate a signal of up to 22 blabla kilohertz reconstruct clearly and you will not notice any difference the electronics are so clever susan filter and low pass filter in the first place approximation there is still what handling with the exits just so I mentioned it, what else is going on in the forgot to create comments down there to me This signal again can be clearly reconstructed and almost without errors and so we come now already to the resolution but you have that look so far look at it again once again about advancing the thought and actually we have to accept that every audible signal every sound can be built together by sine waves that the ear only hears up to 20 kilohertz all around that when I do a filter at 20 kilohertz it cuts off 22 kilohertz when I use the double frequency this sine sample which will end up when it comes back on villa wants to bring the speakers through a suitable filter reconstructed and everything is top notch resolution 4 20 bit that still needs a lot be better than 16 bit well 16 bit are always good to look around about 96 gb that may not tell you now but if we one signal to noise ratio of 96 db then that's pretty gaga if you 24 bit do you have something around 140 the few intoxication distance what that means your circuit so all the technology that has to process the fun here be good if these 24 bits are really to be fully used The fact is that less than 144 dw is better than 144 the opponents at a distance So is it with affordable circuits and why are the 16 bits enough? 16 bit means that your great singing signal or like you are on the transverse flute pair playing sits chatting but no matter that this signal is for the 65,536 steps if you disassemble the zero and that's when it started Arguing with the CD, yes, that's not much, well, it sounds like that busy as 216 50 136 then it sounds like little but it is not problem maybe you now have a sine and in the lower area of ​​the nuller well, maybe it just swings that way nice by your bit but there you have if he has the error order in this area where the below a resolution of the biz so the sine just swing under this tension of course you won't hear or maybe I won't do that if you act stupid But there are still some differences that go to the simple examples today newspaper black and white pictures in the good old days have a look with a magnifying glass how do you actually do that because in the past the newspaper could only do schwarz bembel no schwarz bembel schwarzberg replies gray but if you make black campbell of different sizes or other carrier direction but when actually modulates that 100% 0% 100% 0 percent that is practically in the moderation or we are now doing the big one arc like leds pwm moderated leds are at a certain time off eye is integrated then back on with audio it is just as you can I have yes here just made so beautiful you can see this picture that i am now statically on 1 let PWM switch on and off moderately you can, so to speak, twitch that so you continue to face now again here the big four and here the sine that swings down and in this area, where it is very high, the bid is often pro time unit switched on and down there the whole thing is becoming less and less integrated then on and then the error is not that big but you have one noisy signal noise at the level of the smallest biz in practice is likely but that could make a little difference on youtube wiegens example for that so now what was actually clear 44.1 khz 16 bit earlier it was at some even 14 bit is enough but now I have promised you that in the end there are still a few applications where that might not be 24 bits can be of use to you, for example, if you haven't already knows exactly how loud it gets, so simple or modulated just so unknown maybe the signal says louder then you can have this to keep and in no case shouldn't be off control that is what collects alone when steering out of the way when it is in the border area or the end area expensive converter bears because then he simply takes into account the amount then just constant voltage because he can no longer control that's why you shouldn't oversteer under any circumstances - that's in the analog area I’m stupid, but in the digital area it’s impossible and there’s no way you guys a few more about the 16 bit actually help that mix 24 bit is easier than that the higher sampling frequencies year doesn't really look like much except that your data volume increases unbelievably when it signals slower, for example wanted to play that can possibly bring you something but the real joke is i had in between i hope you guys have it actually raised your hand to the message yes the filter said the anti aliasing filter at the input of the converter which I am looking for here an invoice function as symbolized that is ideal but is not or It is incredibly expensive when I hear the frequency take 88.4 kilometers if doubles then you don't have to be too steep the filter because it doesn't have to be 20 kilohertz or 22 khz really the way you switch it before because of that worth it here so yes take such a course and if it so one course it can be that the higher frequencies get in there seduce and that was so stupid and that sounds like Shit with higher frequencies you can take and cheaper filters the whole thing also applies to the starting section, a cd player, for example the same thing occurs here and that's why the cd player there were those who used to know you might not remember with fourfold sampling obersendling is basically the opposite to come with another video because otherwise it will now even be a bit I'm a little looking forward to the comments below the video as I said, look again at a previous video, next it will be again or for the first time to go over oscilloscopes and slide transformation has me actually really fun now I've been looking forward to it for a year or two years ago on the video like now the time was right so far The summer break here is so much too good for you in the comments I will continue to discuss this somewhat cautiously in the comments but this is just not good for my nerves and then I'll have to start again soon instead of coffee and that's not good for me so I'll stay with coffee and me now will watch you in the comments and then from time to time to your lax Distribute comments and whoever has a really great comment creates the clicks receives from me that is tradition here so see you next times servus"

Sure, some smartphone manufacturers today are releasing some unique and cool sound tech but there's still a very, very long way to go before the portable amp/DAC market for smartphones is rendered obsolete.

Raghav's spent a lot of time with the iBasso DC01 and DC02 this past week and he's got a lot to say! These micro amp/DACs are made for USB-C smartphones and not just sound great, but are pretty cheap too.

Now you could plug that into your smartphone while listening to music while on the go from your favorite streaming service or you could plug into a Hi-Resolution audio player like this. Has an amazing DAC and amazing AMP and really brings out the best in any headphone making your IEM sound completely unearthly. Now, 2 devices are not so much fun. You don't want to carry 2 Devices with you everywhere and very often a Hi-Resolution audio player can be more expensive then the earphone itself. I have got the ideal solution for and that’s to convert your smartphone to a Hi-Resolution audio player that can sound amazing and still be convenient and portable inexpensive and that's to use this. This is a iBasso DC01 and iBasso DC02 DAC both of them are basically DAC and AMP that are fitted into something that’s the size of a pendrive and you can simply plug this into your smartphone to convert into a Hi-Resolution audio player. They cost less than 5,000 rupees so it's probably the most inexpensive of enjoying Hi-Resolution music of the highest quality while on the go. While this device uses the battery from your smartphone to power up and serves as an amplifier it also features the DAC that are amongst the best sounding DAC’s on the market that are available on Hi-Resolution audio player at several times the price and it's at a fraction of the cost. iBasso DC01 and DC02 are both very very similar but with very important differences. The DC02 is a more consumer friendly earphone DAC that you can use with any smartphone it comes with a 3.5mm Jack. It plays Hi-Resolution music of the highest bit rates and sample rates that's available out there and it’s got a very warm laid back sound signature it got an AKM 4490 DAC. So they should sound amazing on any headphone or IEM. The DC01 on the other hand is more for serious audiophiles who really know what they are going for. It costs the same amount of money as the DC02 but it comes with a 2.5mm balanced output to use this you are gonna need a headphone or an IEM that really has a balanced cable with a 2.5 mm cable termination you will also find that this features an 8 code cable so its a lot more studier looks nicer and it used the latest AKM 4493 DAC which gives it a really really sharp and an accurate sound signature something that any audiophile really gonna enjoy a lot. Now, between both these devices I cannot recommend them enough for anybody who started off in this hobby. If you have a earphone that has a balanced cable and a balanced 2.5mm termination then DC01 is your ideal device to be able to bring out the absolute best of sound from this earphone and you are starting off and you have got a earphone which has a 3.5mm jack is quite literally the easiest way of enjoying your music on the go anywhere. Keep in mind that my smartphone doesn't even have a 3.5 mm Jack and the DC02 quite literally the only device I need while listening to music on the go. Get yours now."

this on style - I know so switch the style want to see what that is all this is clean right here yeah I like I like that I like blue but this orange is actually pretty tight so let's go back into settings let's go to common settings and you've just got a screen off timer brightness I spin them up time or how long you can go okay so you can have it stay on for 32 set for 30 seconds right now and you've got your brightness I haven't seen something like this in a long time so it's set to three you've got time shutdown so auto power off after ten minutes it's set to and you've got power off after 120 minutes yeah all right get back out of here and you've got a boost boot volume memory custom shortcut keys so you can do all invalid you can do sound effects you can do all effects for the shortcut key and one end of the shortcut key and there's a little LED down here but it's probably be this one right here I don't think so let's go back yeah that's the best to get into the settings looks like that might be the shortcut key let's go back to common settings here let's go back to information so it's just got the Daedalus manufacturing everything language and initialize that's how you reset it so if you go down to music I don't have anything on it yet then you've got what is this is playlist you got it from radio you got your microphone right here for recording and let's do a quick test this is an audio test for the new dope dodo cool mp3 player / FM radio / whatever you want to be then I pause it see and then the saved so let's go to files and it should be something in here here's a recording let's go back this trackball thing is super sensitive the little track wheel here's the file that I did this is an audio test for the new dope dodo cool mp3 player / FM radio / whatever you want it to be and that's it so this is nice I'm gonna load some music up and I'll tell you how it actually how it actually sounds you know this guy 8 gigs of memory in here so I mean this is it's gonna be it's gonna be nice man it's gonna be nice you get again you get the 2 interface that's kind of sensitive I wonder if I could actually change I'm sure I could change it make it a little less sensitive it's like super sensitive now here's the other style for those that like the other style some of those some music on here I'm actually gonna use it around the house test it out I've got some headphones to plug in I can also do audio out I'll do more recordings and everything like that so it should mange will I'll check out that FM radio - stay tuned for an update on this man this is just the unboxing and initial impressions of it and in here you probably in jail what about the rest of the box yeah you just get a charging cable on here that's pretty much in you get a warranty and registration card and uh but something like this it doesn't take a lot to learn how to work something like this this is kind of like basic iPod knowledge you know so there it is managed to mange will the dodo cool or data cool however is pronounced apologize to the company we're not saying it right but this is actually pretty hot I haven't had like the something like this in a long time so I'll see you guys in the next video I'm feeling it man so far as looking like it's gonna be a pretty hot little toy to play with I bet I can stand up on its own - yeah yeah fire by it of fire I'm going to use this for really are I'll see you next video

10:14:19.589884, okay I just did a video but I've messed it up at the end and I realized that as I'm doing this this is really not a fingerprint magnet which is amazing because compared to the higher-end file devices I've been moving my fingers around this as you can see and it's really not doing this is uh this is a shockingly cool development I just realized this as I was who cares well I I do actually so I just did a bunch of finger stuff on this and it's really not doing anything that much I swipe up got my own background back they're going to fire music I'm using the darker theme right now my musics gonna start it up I prefer the dark theme it's just easier for me to read it's going to recently play and see if that works yes it does good girls got rhythm and going to that speed of the device is not bad now it should have lockscreen set so that if I go ahead and okay it's got a nice lock screen can I just follow them all I'm in now I can okay swipe to get out of the lock screen touch the album art and then I've got basic info I've got the EQ there's my EQ I've got you know play once play through play all I playlist I can create a playlist right here favorite I can delete this track or if I can get the full all of the info for this track like everything it's it's got this is showing the effects of a company that's been working through its player in firmware clearly this is actually feeling quite sure hey I'm not getting into sound because I haven't listened to it yet this is mm this is just getting a better look because that video that I put up last night sucked and but some people just want to get their eyes on it so that was why that video was done go back go back again all songs I can select go back select by artist go back everything's moving at a fairly decent speed I don't have a lot of stuff on here right now but it's not bad I'm not getting that much of a lag I'm I'm no complaints right now as far as the time goes genre okay I don't know what the file Jonah is folder sdcard internal storage um playlist I don't have any recently added if I go home go to settings if I'm radio this is some broadcasting region yeah no I'll keep that there no no no no no if you want to know about the radio that'll have to come later audio this is really what this is all about for a lot of people um wireless the phones nowadays are some of them are not even they don't even have headphone out so people are forced to go wireless because it's it's the cool hip thing to do and so far as I'm concerned the standard that is out there that is the best is the L back which is a sony proprietary codec I believe I'm sure that actually and then also a lot of things are aptX HD a lot of the newer phones are standard with that a lot of the a lot of DAPs don't actually have that though this has both file had to pay Sony to have the right to do that so because I'm a sony fanboys this is important to me the irony is I don't really have anything that supports Zelda as far as headphones and I am ago that I don't know I got a check so I got a buy headphones or Iams that support this so I can try to get the full I got el DAC on my WM 1a but I'm a wired guy so and this is something that is for not wired people and I want to enjoy it it's got that kind of oh you know whoa oh damn what am i oh it's got that kind of build where you're not really gonna worry about that this is not really scratch sensitive and not only that I've been playing with this in touch in it now let's go back to this lock screen it's not that bad I'm you know looking for the finger swipes and the grease and it's a humid day in Japan right now and the screens pretty damn good it's better than all the the flagship when it comes to it kind of blows my mind a little let's get into something black and try to get a good look at no no no no let's get into something black so that I can see a reflection of grease not really seeing it and that's a big deal to me because when you pull something out a pocket and it's just covered with finger grease it becomes quite annoying and I don't get that with this that's pretty cool so I'll be doing a full review on to give a look at this there's a power button in the daylight there's the 3.5 or line out I believe I can set that let me go back audio select output line out okay so I can I can select that is line out balance inline remote so I'll be doing a review I want to go ahead and get this in a better light and also just get a feel for it's the functional speed of it which seems pretty decent I'm not I don't feel myself waiting too much stuff is and that's playing that's got a nice little EQ action going on it right now I'm not up to the latest firmware on the x7 so I don't know if this is standard like with it but this is the most mature version of the file players that I've seen so far it's really got everything and that's it just a little six-minute video with a better look under better light and the review will be next I'll probably put this in a couple videos anyway until then nothing's jumping out at me right now that's bad the money shot there we go

126,uK6e2fhtJNI,WhatGear,UC134rgaltHWHrkYc-R8lkZg,SONY Hi Res Walkman ZX100HN,"Sony are ready to take another crack at the portable audio market. Can they take back what was once theirs is a market that they pioneered? 

Unfortunately from what I heard this Walkman is not for everyone, because its likely to be pretty damn expensive. That is going by the pricing of the earlier version. 

Now I'm not sure if isolating a very small part of the SONY audience is the best choice when trying to recapture Walkmans former glory. What do you think?

Anyway check this thing out & let me know what you think.

says governed from Gavin's gadgets this is the Shandling MO portable music player and as you can see is the smallest high res Baqarah the small high res audio player with L DAC Bluetooth and Qualcomm up X Y great so in the Box you get the device itself which is here I'll show that in a second you lift this out and under here you get the instruction book in there you've got this cable just quite nice USB see you notice so very handy so terms of specification let's have a look so your high rates 1.5 for touchscreen gesture control I'll show you how that works it's not aptX HD is just app text but does have L Dax only cell back there so you can take microSD cards I've got a 200 gig card in at the moment the saber ESS es 91 8p back bi-directional USB audio st. for Bluetooth 6 there more severe PCB 15 hours backs right left up to 30 hours standby time so that's that pretty much and here it is it is tiny so to give you a comparison of what this looks like if you're looking at a pen you can see that a pen is really big compared it's my thumb it's across my thumb it's very very small so you have the wheel which is the volume and the power on and off on the back a few little bits wash angling here behind this you have the micro SD card you also have our second so if you can see just in the top there there's a micro site a reset so there's any problem that's the reset pin there switch that in obviously you can have this as a DAC or you can connect it via your space so you can access the music it can work as a back for your PC and convert the sound so you work as a standalone DAC and on Bluetooth it can receive Bluetooth from your phone and then usually plug your headphones and here's acts as a Bluetooth receiver and transmitter works both ways and both ways on the USB but it's simple as you literally just turn it on now if you just gently hold and press for three seconds you go to the now playing screen it is that simple you have settings playback folders my music now playing and that's that and you can have the swipe to the right to go back one level here this is for updating the music so you can have it as automatic as you can see you swipe one to go back bluetooth on and when you turn it on let's do that now it says system starting and you can change the quality sorry for the quality so you got various I L back options now where you can't see the rest of text if you just swipe like so from the left in it shows you some of the options there and there we go so you've got a few options on Bluetooth the Bluetooth I'll cover off with some police your headphones and my findings on that brightness you can adjust the brightness problem screen off you can adjust the timings of the screen off all types of screen off idle sleep timer as well USB mode this is where you can have it and you switch it between so that's on it that way it's now asked when you connect it it will allow you to access the music on your phone from your PC so sort transfer across that's what the DAC clock that's setting the time here if you swipe here volume locks you don't accidentally do the volume a car like this so you can double tap this and you can have it to do a few options it sets just to go off but I think next is quite handy so the screen off or the screen on you can dub what's happened do that DSD mode has you've got a couple options on the DSD mode output and here you have it at full output so if you're using this as line outs your options there themes yeah it does have themes so let's have a look what we've got various different themes you can choose whichever one you like let's try black for change so I thought that's quite nice just set the language about system update unless you have you actually load owns the microSD card now playing is that here it is my music folders playback so here in the playback you can select various options here from gapless to EQ the game and on the EQ you can have first different options there this system Shandling OS is so simple to use filter and you've got a various options on the field sir sometimes quite difficult to tell the difference balance folder going north sure folder skip so you got options on there you can actually access some of those settings for the music and here you will play music and here you've got all the different options there but if we just open up the album there's a couple of sort of issues here one is the scrolling so just just scroll slowly is fine but if you don't like that it goes really fast and it's hard and you've got a lot of stuff sometimes to make sure you don't scrub too quickly so here when you're tapping on it you can then scroll here to bring up that that's the all those pay options that you saw in the other menu info and tells you about the information on it if it was a high-res codec or file it will show HR in yellow I want to find something to show you that so tap again one and soon there's no lyrics don't show up there's the battery levels there Clutton times a second and there we have it very very simple really simple now there is you can get this little box here and you open this box you get the little another case for it I'm gonna put it in there now because it is quite small one slippery and having so much to grip I think absolute essential I've always some links to all these products so you know what I'm talking about now this blue state and I'll show you three headphones on the Bluefish side and what I found cuz you might be interested to know airports connected no problem you make sure you select the codec AAC always best to put the maximum codec each headphone before you connect to it but it was missing volume it just didn't seem to go high enough for some reason on these bows these are the I don't know if it but the wireless Bose sound sound sport Wireless true Wireless bit problematic it's out excellent but there's the connection kept dropping so these both have similar things they are completely Wire free and I think it has issues there's no problem the volume on these it's all these the QC 35 mark twos perfect so I think anything where they're not completely Wire free and there's wise in you know between the two headphones or earphones I think have no issue with bluetooth I do think they need to traphouse work on the Bluetooth in terms of the connection stability but these are fine when you're using Wire free stuff by these knots or not so good at a transport this is the Pheo q5 so I've connected this sensor here use this as a digital transport only so the Pheo works very well no problem doing that so headphone wise just put up some additional headphones so heavy and wise so Sennheiser Momentum's awesome absolutely awesome with this dynamics punch depth range the best on the best combinations of these particular headphones that I've used that look a bit the dwarf so small but gotta say with the bear dynamics yeah it is absolutely great that's all and then finally a nice pair of Sennheiser's these work very very well these are 50 ohms they do say up to 150 again yep that's possible pushing its limits of the what you can put out but with this you know what it is I've got a sound quality just defies its size in price you know this is a nice you nine pound player and I think it's absolutely beautiful there is another case they're bringing out a sort of clear case which has a clip on the back that can't come soon I think that's really useful I'm personally going to stick a bit of velcro and have this on something else it'll attach to so it won't keep sliding around and what law but great great sounds got deep meaningful bass sound stage isn't the widest it does depend on the top headphone it does have bluetooth to a bluetooth so it can receive and send transmittance end so it all I think this is a beautiful bus and I'm really really happy but there hopefully future firmware updates will fix the Bluetooth which doesn't work so well on things like this you know these sort of devices races Gavin from Gavin's gadgets I'll leave the links for these any questions do ask I will always answer them bye for now

10:14:19.590045, hey YouTube Wes here checking in with something a bit different today today we are talking about depth digital audio players I just recently got a new one in very new to the market and pretty excited about it wanted to share it with you all let you know about it and give you my first thoughts impressions do it go ahead and do an unboxing of it and this DAP is from hibi a new to the market kind of company even though they've been sort of in the background many many years designing interfaces for other other companies digital players they're really good at interface design and they have just recently got into creating their own line of digital audio players and they recently did a Kickstarter for a newer sort of lower end player the hibi r3 and as it's a smaller player it's it's not Android based it has its own operating system that's designed by hibi it's a 3.2 inch touchscreen it does a lot of things it's a Swiss Army knife of a digital audio player it can be used as a a DAC it can be used as a headphone amp it can stream Bluetooth both ways it has Wireless built in so you can stream from right now only extremes from title you can do a lot of different things with this has a really nice ESS deck in it I'll go ahead and share with you some of the specifications here real quick yeah ESS 90 28 g2m deck from ESS bluetooth 4.1 both ways apdex 3.2 inch touchscreen supports DSD files which is awesome that's something I'll talk about the player I have been using for the past year and a half does not support DSD file this is going to be an upgrade for me it does airplay 802 802 11 B G and N wireless it does have a balanced output if you have balance drivers balance in ear monitors kind of thing does support those supports up to 64 bit 384 kilohertz files does all your big names sort of lossless files it supports apple lossless files which is very important to me personally very small as I said touchscreen should be a really nice device it's gonna retail for 230 dollars so pretty reasonably priced players go ahead and quickly show you here this is the player I have been using up till now for the past year and a half this is a vo xx 1 player mark to the vo logo on the back and this is a really nice entry-level kind of digital audio player really nice amp and deck in here for the price you're gonna get this for right under $100 supports a lot you know your all your flack this supports Apple Apple Lossless as well which is nice does does nice things as I said it does not support DSD files and it's kind of an older design of a digital audio player you know you have just your physical buttons here and a sort of a capacitive sort of scroll wheel here but a nice player nonetheless and and it's it's it's been it's been a good experience as far as the sound quality and the portability and I've really enjoyed it but I'm looking for something that does a little bit more I'm sort of into gadgets so like the idea of having a touchscreen having bigger bigger album or miss the album art on here shows up it doesn't really fit really well on this screen and it it's kind of a lower quality screen in here so that's the Pheo x1 as i said i've been using this for about a year and a half really nice player if you want to sort of get your feet wet give give a high-end digital audio player a try this is this is a great way to go in my opinion and as i said keeping it cheap I'm not I don't have my money invested in these records back here you know I don't invest a lot of money in digital stuff but I like to have quality's a certain level of quality so that's what these are these players are offering me but these are the kzz ST in-ear monitors are really like these the KZ has very affordable line of in-ear monitors tried a few of them now I really like these zs teased a lot got the upgraded silver cable on it really nice in-ear monitors also for you know over-ear sort of headphones I got these from these are staged right on your headphones I got these through monoprice really comfortable really good sounding pair of headphones I've got several sets of cheaper on ear monitors from it from monoprice if monoprice has a lower price on ear monitor on your headphone kind of thing I've probably tried it I have I have several of them and I really enjoy playing with those so let's go ahead and get into the meat of this thing let's get this r3 unboxed and check it out and give you my first impressions of it so this did just arrive at my doorstep yesterday I believe I'm one of the first people to get this as far as the actual Kickstarter backers there's been some confusion as far as the shipping on these there there was offered a leather case that was offered as part of one of the add-on items with this and I chose not to get that even though I do use a leather case on my Pheo x1 and I figure I'll probably eventually get a leather case for this but I don't need it to start off with so I did not get that as an add-on so the people that did have that added on that they're their shipping was delayed because there was a problem with the design on that and they had to redo those ok so just a plain brown box open this up see what we got here where's what you get pretty plain as I said pretty pretty plain experience this out okay so do the first thing we have here is a carrying case just have the hippy logo on it there's also a plastic outer case that they added on as a goal for reaching for reaching a certain level of sales through the Kickstarter project this is just a clear outer case this will just help help me protect it until I can get the leather case at some point when I've decided I want to keep this so that's that was one of the bonus items so here is the hibi r3 itself sort of a retail kind of packaging looks really nice and one of the things they did to sort of do some cost-cutting on this is that it does not have any built-in memory so I'm gonna have to use like like the vo x1 here you have to use a micro SD card which is not a problem it's the way I would rather it be rather than have internal memory and try to have to transfer stuff back and forth I like a card that I can just move around between computers and players and all kinds of things like that slide this out just slides right off there nextly design embossed a box so let's open this up boom insert in here throw that there all right so there's the there's the presentation in the box first thing you see here is the player go ahead and pull the player out of here okay does have a nice feel to it nice heft to it nice size screen protector tells you what all the buttons this has nice physical buttons on the side which is really nice you know you get volume and play pause forward and back and there's the there's the are three next to the Pheo x1 so about the same thickness I would say a little bit smaller overall as far as the the height the width is about the same I would say a little bit a little bit wider on our three that Theo is still in its case so let's see what other kind of items we have in the bottom here start with this little little black box here I think this might be the USB 3 cord and that's what it is our USB see so this is my first USB see device which is nice these USB sees can be plugged in either way like the lightning cable on my on my iPhone so that's that's really nice I can't stand those micro USB plugs you have to figure out which way it's going and they always feel like they're gonna break when you put them in they're so fragile so this will be nice to have you BC so that's the that's the cable next thing I got here they have actually did two different outer cases this is the white one it's the one I showed you before was a clear clear plastic I'm gonna do white or clear plastic man so there's the light case just a snap-on plastic case this one has more of a matte finish to it so it's a little less slippery than the then a clear one will probably be but one more box here as the hippie logo on it don't remember what exactly this is maybe just some instructions and screen protector little instruction booklet kind of thing warranty information that kind of stuff and then lastly two more it feels like a glass screen protector in a plastic screen protector I think maybe the glass one goes on the front in the plastic goes on the back but I believe this probably already has some applied to it and also as well some high res audio stickers that you can stick on stick on the device itself or wherever it's up to you so let's get this this peeled off plug it in and see what it sounds like and it's already does have screen protectors applied to it really nice glass back on this I really like it's a really beautiful design item you get your regular 3.5 millimeter microphone jack and then your balanced 2.5 millimeter output in here you get your power button your play/pause and your trek for track back kind of thing on this side and then on the other side you have your volume up and down which is really nice on the bottom you have your USB type-c connector and the micro SD card slot so let's go ahead and power this baby up well I'm going to put a card in I just I just started it up so it's gonna start up without a card in it I don't know if it's going to complain that there's no card or not but we'll see so there it wants me to choose the language English and it's pretty much booted up ready to go but as I said there's no card in it so I'm gonna power this off and start over with a card in here okay so let's boot this baby up once again and go ahead and do a scan see how long it takes I got a 64 gig card in here it is not completely full it's probably two-thirds of the way full counting up the tracks here and there we go takes a second for the album art to load in albums there's an album list it's so it's gonna be so nice to have a touchscreen to be able to use start this playing here on the side here you do have an LED status LED I believe this will change colors depending on the type of file you are listening to you swipe in from the sides all four sides different things you get a slip up from the bottom got your track controls here swipe in swipe in from left and you get you know settings and different EQ settings and all kinds of things like that see so I've been from the right there and you're gonna get to your sort of album screen view nice album artwork display pay pause it tells you this is a sixteen point for black file you know track title taiko glider swipe down from the top swipe down from the top is your your basic settings like any kind of Android or Apple OS kind of thing you know you're gonna get your Bluetooth on and off Wi-Fi on and off Wi-Fi settings airplane mode whatever whatever whatever those kind of things so yeah let me get this plugged in and give it a listen excited I'm gonna start off with the GS T's here from K Z this is sort of my my on-the-go lightweight kind of quality setup here I do not own any balanced headphones as of now but definitely a potential thing in the future so initial thoughts on the hippie are three I'm liking a lot as I said it's kind of a Swiss Army knife of a device it can be used as a digital audio player you can use this as a deck it can wirelessly stream things you can stream things back and forth from it to it it does a lot I'm sort of just now getting breaking into the surface of it as you saw there was a trying to do have a firmware update on this to see what kind of if there's any kind of new features or fixes I have to look into more what what that involves it was downloading pretty slowly so I'm gonna go ahead and hold off on the firmware update for right now but so far yet sounds sounds really good the touchscreen is really great really responsive it's very brilliant very pretty to look at the device itself is really pretty really nice rounded corners you know you get glass on the front in the back it's it feels like a really premium device like the physical controls on the side yeah there's a lot to like here for the price I think it's it's a good deal I don't have a lot of experience with these kind of players as I said I had the feel excellent player and a head and I forget they're they they have a $50 player that's more of like really plasticky and small but it sounded really good so if you wanted if you want to try something for $50 there's a Pheo m10 or something maybe is the M M model I'm not sure after maybe I can put a little uh little thing down here letting you know that that model but if you look at the Pheo players and look at their low-end it sounded sounded great the controls were a little clunky and it just didn't it didn't have the quality feel that's you know this x1 or this stuff for you are this hippie r3 does so let me know in the comments below if you have any questions about this device if you want me to try out different things let me know what you want to know about it if you're curious about it let me know if you got one yourself if you have any tips or hints or anything to help me get get some better usage out of this but I'm gonna play around with this for a while get used to it get some more music loaded on here and so that's the heavy our three unboxing first impressions definitely looking forward to getting into this some more hope you enjoyed this video if you did give me a thumbs up as I said leaving some comments down below any questions you might have about the device if you're curious about getting one I want to do some try and do some of these reviews of some of these some of these budget headphones even though there are a lot of them a lot of them out there it's always great to have more opinions on these things one thing I did speaking of headphones one thing I did notice about this it doesn't seem to have the same amount of output power that the the Pheo x1 does this this r3 was having a little bit of trouble powering these these on here large he's a 50 millimeter drivers in here it's having a little bit of power a little bit of trouble powering these I think didn't seem to be as punchy as the x1 but these in-ear monitors drives them great sounds awesome with these in-ear drivers so I think this is gonna be more of an in-ear kind of player it's a small compact player I think you're gonna be using this more the with a with an in-ear kind of thing anyway that's that's typically my experience anyway so maybe not for some bigger more power hungry headphones but the in-ear sound great on this so that's that's sort of my first initial noticing of something that may may be a downside of this players just doesn't have the power that some other ones do so that's gonna do it try and keep from making this long video a longer thank you for watching as I say give me a thumbs up subscribe if you're interested in hear more about some some final records or craft beer or anything like that I do a lot of different things here on the channel so thank you for watching have a great day a great night whenever you're watching this and we'll see you again real soon Cheers

thank Lily fire thank you very much also got the fh7 so I am fans I'll be be doing that one we're gonna go ahead and start with this one we take this plastic off real quick try to do it off camera so that I don't offend people with the sound of screeches scratchy plastic panning shot high-tech visual stuff going on here man I mean Levin stuff picture of the item on inside slide it out nice and easy no battling some people be disappointed I tend to get really upset really easily with tight boxes now that's not to say I don't like tight boxes of I'll just let that go you know what I mean tight boxes are not bad just not for box boxes open it up forget it's you can't open it all the way this is pretty big smart high-res music player it's coming with plastic on it Harbor on the top this has got three gigs of RAM I believe I'm gonna do a video well that's that's a fast start I'll go over the English select a myth for navigation control [Music] Wow whoo I'm gonna go with the I'm gonna live on the wild side turn the previous menu okay I get it return home switch recent test trigger you know function got it this is moving along quite nice and snappy actually about Chester music nice and fast okay let me go ahead and take this off real quick I wanna see nice this is big look at that 4.4 like right out of the box I still incur and why could you not do that for me 3.5 USBC got two slots power button on top volume I guess I'd be play paused and then the rocker switch right here I'm gonna go ahead and load some music on this and I'm gonna do walkthrough probably what is he doing I'm looking for two E's I just ate lunch man my initials can I see the grease of my fingers on this not really nice there's almost no edge on this I think I liked it just the thing I'll have to use that this is big how does it sound I mean give me a give me a minute so this will be coming up I mean you just decide put it on there what else do you get inside the box I'm gonna get some wild guesses nothing under there does this have another cover no I can manual and stuff this is for getting the card out this is gonna be charging [Music] [Applause] I already got that out so I'll probably do another walk through an initial sound impressions but this is basically what you're gonna get in the box let's take a look at the screen now when you go it up this angle is where you white stuff out this is an easy angle this is an easy angle this is an easy angle this is where stuff get whiteout if I'm not mistaken the DX 220 it's a little wishy-washy even though that's supposed to be a really high quality screen I saw a review for this item done and the person that was doing it was talking about how it's a great multimedia device and I thought I've been watching videos for so many years that I know when somebody's taking potshots at an item and that's what that was for $500 are they kicking ass for point for dual SD slots huge screen very high quality screen this is something needs to be talked about like how are you gonna use this like a phone get a phone man no hard edge is like the I guess that's a little bit sharp on the edge but I like this a lot better than I do the industrial-looking X 7 and the X 7 - I thought those were a little - mmm I just didn't like the overall presentation of them I understand this for protection but I think this looks beautiful as it is and remember that stuff I was doing like writing my fingers this is this is what makes something look disgusting after you've been using it for a couple hours and something look nice I'm not seeing maybe it's just me looking through the viewfinder so I'm not catching it but it looks like that screen is pretty clean considering I just ate lunch and the back side as well so is it really last I don't know but it's behaving like it nice who cares I do because if I'm gonna have a big large screen and I'm gonna look at it a lot I don't want to be looking at my fingers and constantly wiping it like I do with some stuff so I expected because it didn't promote and guerrilla guy I can see on the back but I kind of expect that my hand is heating up the back back here so I'm cool with that I don't want to see my fingerprints every single time I touch on this thing and I'm not and all my cables are four point four recently so this is really nice and I've got on a rule yes I think it's called tube amp that is designed for the Sony 4.4 s or the Sony ZX 300 and the WM brothers and I can use it for this too if I choose to if I want to go tube sound so I'll be doing a review for this I just took about a two minute event and turned it into ten because that's how I roll so got the the the DX has one slot Mike Alex has two Sony has one but the Sony's got 256 onboard this has got 32 but I can use two of my cards frickin I'm um I'm insane you can't stop me the which card is the one that I want to use about this slot okay nice way that that way the other way now okay let's see yeah I'm okay I'm digging the gist of stuff mm scan find that resume sleep scan for music scan select folks can't all let's just go nuts I wasn't planning on doing this but when you don't use the script stuff kind of tends to go off the rails people say things that they shouldn't say compare items I probably shouldn't so if this thing does something weird I've already totally it's it's it's out the plastics taking off if the sink starts hiccuping and freezing there's no way around it it's gonna be caught on lap that's why they're editing not doing editing is kind of good whatever this is uploaded to I guess I gotta click confirm' no clue music mmm don't give it its first little fill-up such as lovin there I can do this this is kind of doing the same thing that the the DX 220 is doing by the time that stops its field top field stop field stop field when it gets to the point where you get to the end and then it's like buh buh-buh-buh them ah I'm not cool with that let's go ahead and what would be the two park of course it's a DSD course it is Tupac DST no the ex found hmm ex found don't learn in this as I go yeah that take me back take me too though okay yeah dude is learning the gesture system right now we go back where was um looks beautiful okay I'm doing it this is this this is a hey hey live video man this is a very nice UI experience I I didn't like the file before now again by the time I get to the final nine boxes boom boom that's what I want I do not want lag I don't care that I'm looking at those things as long as when this thing starts it doesn't do the poo poo poo poo poo you know what I'm saying mmm how much does this thing cost you should I thought it had like a shake thing for line let it bleed one finger action if I hold that down okay no lyrics found then the background as you can see is giving me just a blown out about that and you cancel that no but now I like this is what I quash this smooth just drop not a jarring drop just a drop let me go back in there let me play it we going to this one look at the dude as he learns how to use this thing okay we go back in there what's this what's this nice this is gonna take me home this is where I keep messing up boom I need a picture of my chick on there first impressions best fire music I've used so far 17 minutes you guys if you still hear youtubers that the screen is dope it's super large the user interface if I want to go back there I assume I can wait a second mmm is this gonna give me like a lock screen maybe I can figure out how to use that go down boom take me back this is this is the simple stuff my brain now watch this carefully you see how smooth that was I'm taking that big time and this is what I like and this is where a Stalin Karen got me as a fan not not of anything except for the UI is this illusion of no lag because by the time it gets to where I'm doing the top ones are there loaded in between you know but stop there stop there stop there stop there wherever it is supposed to be so the coding of these companies firebase o has gotten better this is beautiful this is absolutely beautiful good job you guys and for the price that they're asking for this stupid is this is gonna be compared with the DX 220 yeah it is and that's gonna activate a few people to go ahead and do their own comparisons before I do mine because that's what that's what they do and as a bonus to counteract they're trying to counteract me I'm gonna go ahead and share who the who the paid monkey Waterboys are for I basil because the game of trying to protect images and all that is fascinating and pathetic kind of at the same time I haven't heard this yet it's gonna have to sound up to not be wrecked over something that's twice its price somebody did a review like I said because I wanted to see before I got this you know what's the consensus or consensus what's one person's opinion and they were talking about it at the very end of the review it says it sent phonics and they said it's not the best sounding dad and with no context whatsoever let me tell you another thing the person in his review said that the bass bleeds into the sub-base are you musician do you know what the he's talking about because I've been in car audio for God too long home audio the bass is bleeding into the sub-base now the this the sub bass is a part of the bass technically mid bass is something that was added like ten years ago it wasn't really talked about much in car audio you've got bass who got mids and you got treble and some people talked about late bass mid bass is something that just it's like Pratt if you type Pratt into Google it's gonna tell you a definition that's basically go ahead type Pratt in Google right now bass the bleeds into sub bass no bleeds into is like a phrasal verb kind of you know what I mean not kind of it's it's two words put together they create a new meaning bleed like something and then into like into another thing bass bleeds into mids is clear for you to visualize because it's the bass should stay where the bass belongs and then if it's bleeding into the mids that means that it's going longer it's maybe technically on the measured spectrum beyond three thirty which it that means it is bleeding into the mids to say that something's bleeding into the sub bass to say that the bass is bleeding into the sub bass is to look like a [ __ ] and then to summarize you're not very long review and to say this is not the best step but it's good for and something about playing games or something it's like they sent you a free DAP and you used it as a kick toy to prepare for what I think is coming next which is gonna be a another worldly praise for the DX two twenty do I do I like the two twenty I do is it worth its price it's much cheaper than a lot of other dabs this is a lot cheaper than that in first experience with the UI I like this better than the eye base own sound I don't know that's everything but we'll see now that's not everything the experience of using the thing is why I like the Ashland current I hate the company I hate their constant new version gold version this version that verse and all that stuff is total  but that DAP is price right for but that DAP is price right for about a thousand dollars this is like five hundred I'm totally stoked at the way it looks the navigation is excellent how many finger brushes have I put across this thing do you have OCD I know a lot of my viewers do am I not seeing it now I can see chest a little bit there's a finger I've been all over this thing that that's nice that's like take it and rub it on my leg for a second and then nothing that's cool I don't need a cloth around me to take care of this thing so that's a brief intro of my style to the file m11 are gonna do its own review and then we're gonna compare it with another large screen fast great UI having a device that is more expensive and is supported by the distillery it's it's a good give you guys up when I talk about the Hobby and the people that are full of crap I can really point you to a single device and the people that surround it and say look at this and then I can cite certain things and then on my side I can say you know I like this item and then you can go look for yourself and see that some of the items from that company I actually said don't don't buy it feel this audio I like some of it I don't like other ones vgp it's like some of it don't like other ones um file did I wreck the other DAPs that they've sent me recently no but I can point to you some people that work for other companies by proxy they work for them that will say nice things about everything that they get and this is where their damage comes home for them because when I say that I think this thing is on par with or it's not but you can trust me is it worth half of the price that like I said this has really gotta suck to be half the price I believe of the 220 so I'm so stoked to have another new file and another new eye base so together because that's a company that leans on narrative creating people and mmm yeah how many minutes 25 wait too long okay I'm up so that'll be coming up and then also is the fh7 do i wreck this right now like I said without listening to it and just using your eye you just saw it live I didn't I'm not going to edit this except I have the intro and outro nothing hiccup it booted up quickly it's canned easily it played the DSD just by chance I selected that it could have been a vinyl version of Tupac but I hid the DSD just by total lock no hiccups whatsoever no stop stutter lag like the eye base so when I hit DSD track it gives me a 2 or 3 second break nothing I have not updated the firmware because I just opened it up in front of you I'm out until I'm not

going to talk about sharks wessand boy maybe the biggest he in house he became at the moment house tra liewes one label the teen under in order to often come across both on equipment as well as groningen discussions that live on ajax he forms whale sharks has been around for some time, it actually is relevant to you as music lovers churches very very difficult question to start the work by asking what is he teaching to your work I can either drain it all or they hattem it very briefly shortage of elections and it is very simple he travels audio is all better than it did quality whether someone is really much more, it is of course a different question because you have to of course know what CD quality is and then of course you also have to step on what matters what is quality this ceremony it's not about mar CD quality or quality recording options harris audio while strongly after a technical specification a bit like 8 pkc the car about the engine capacity it is not necessarily that it the music will sound good or is of horror quality to do other things like gosh to the quality of the recording itself the post production transport a hamstring and countless other things that happen in the music studio what is the reality this is often referred to by the technical term 44 bowl only one kilo has 16 bit are two numbers or two terms that belong together few people finally really get it the slate lies down again which has 44 commarin is the point of view frequency it tells you each how often do sam plus taken of all were signal of their recording to convert it to digital, let's take a look if the musician plays an instrument in the studio, it doesn't matter what one piano violin attainment is that it is recorded that sound comes out of its isolation then the jug must be used in addition to zeros and ones digitally in advance treatment as well as injured appearance already deliver in digital form through a streaming service for example that is done by sam posts pieces together a number of times per second when she talks about 44 kommarin while he was 32 at the time 44 thousand below as so we could be taken and that is a figure that did not just fall from the sky In the end, it was decided that healthy not yet not Philips when they took the students standard when the police joined in on the crisis-born child they honor yes I propose the boy the unions must take the number of wagons per second to forest to obtain a certain frequency by going to pack 44 bowls at once quietly 44,000 below us per second tietjerk goodie under fire You have 22 pounds which is twice as much bark than what the man is in the fog optimal conditions can actually hurdle a class those plans a baby is more or less because once you get older you hear less and less dirty plus a little more and to allow green for a short time to become considerably in those with a very hard filter that looks at roughly twenty kilos has something on the technical reason is not that interesting at all and also his son's big boss sees something more viewers do tarbes stadium are you talking about everything dollars worth hearing those figures can pass through 96 kilohertz Too many more samples taken due to the many emails per second he also wants the second part of hair from that time that took 16 bit that's 16 bit in other words twitter sixteenth or during that belongs we now have 36 he was stepping from the attack of number be the offense first or be stacked that is but that translates to a specific time in the hamstrings it difference between the latter and the dam on my side of it is approx 46 the disease quite ok complex in other words but if you go with higher to piet who typed verb 32 japan voter the larger dynamic links becomes possible well that is equipped numbers from 44 come easy west and 16 so these are it set the muezzin the standard at the time westwood captured by sony and philips 9 delivered in combat in large part to the rising whats over our hearing very well And I even totally agree with it some more and almost every country acting on behalf of the blues lots of rest and hedel is there certain situations have more reason to have a little decibel than it would work wonderful in practice because ramses has a certain It doesn't matter that much anyways the elections he is that more than adequate the current stadium camps is completely nonsense shore no that is too short-sighted harris from the european title tokyo is used especially in that recording studio at one everything never happen straight to the 44 bowls a kilo rice 16 offers or anyway very rarely the higher sampling frequency is nevertheless worked in advance a higher this type why already in a sound studio a lot of Beijing because of the digital limitations the recordings the wind strikes all cooperation and the errors that may arise in doing so be there disturb was pressed there draw and ciz promoted well above water so a very interesting one but not directly relevant for stars at sight but it is rosell directing both types of patty ajax conversion after the students follow the god's best restrictions in the past if not always so ideal in other words 3 original plan could be good but the saint in that party was at your home it didn't sound so good to that and so it is interesting for her sanyo trucks more attention is paid to those recording qualities and those as home user be careful listeners at home weird quality as the cda was originally intended without that intermediate stage of circulation maybe I changed nothing or something is doing this too and this is this is very controversial the whole discussion whether the frequencies used by the poor ours yes usually not who let the shampoo deserve the driver has in the most optimal conditions alfa romeo is on the discussion about it each to investigate piano and jamal, for example, or a violin pol pot not just one the sound at a certain frequency it is not in the frequency anyway kmart evening but whether there also a number of harmonic notes of a second and third they are, as it were hedge heads from the original ground but on much higher ground frequencies that slow p to peacock sound but it may be when the tools have been ripped off type second or third order best much higher than it has twenty kilos according to traa That is also very debatable, but doing is weighted discussion about Drake called for audibly arm to work on the shelf a view to the future of cancer and if you are late that week therefore you see with a filter to seduce you have to go through that anyway by nature of the consumer determines that is a lot of discussion about I think in the end it is also very difficult to determine because it is a piece of science, of course, but also a secret one experience so far talked about the councilor and about the music itself he has radio is also a label that he has on a lot of nice equipment it is interesting to know the sweden state of harris audio has the iq and then is handed out because you have to ever as to quote but not as in japan equipment assessed on a number of criteria whether or not and it I have committed if you put such a label site on a speaker or on a task although you know that certain frequency it can reproduce very high frequencies compatibility with its wish files to work in itself useful to know for sure if her parents like you doubled out of bales in every music collection but it's not just soest marketing gimmick with speakers, for example, there is a lot to be done for harris audio why if drivers in a speaker councilor stop working on twenty kilos it will really show because Jacobs riders are a bit like the car if you consider that it can drive a maximum of 100 per hour and you have 109 i love holland all over dubai the difference from the side can in addition, there is also not so perfect yep phenomena like break up physical man invest and still deeply believes means of transport therefore if you make a route decision with harris audio that bleaching points looks much higher the limits of what is possible seat frequencies we can certainly be 50 kilos became 60 kilos of rice and that causes the display in the horn of it crisis plan is the defender you see something with those second and third harmonic frequencies that approach a good way you know that but what about he became stadium how do you get there at the moment there is actually not much current stadium to be found the plant one side thijs graste's lips are this opponent if played on it so far terheijden and rekkem

ensures unabated up front we could hear and also on the side of pax there is a lot to be said for strauss kahn a lot of good about preferences there is being worked like talking about the music itself as said, not necessarily such CD recordings are that much worse than that sharks west quay or persie however, those who are no longer attentive traffic shots like the chickens in between recording and

142,CMUVjob4yhE,Earphoneus Fanaticus,UCQHpSHPRpKPozVcf0qpX1HQ,Onkyo DP-X1A Hi-Res Digital Audio Player Unboxing! |Earphoneus Fanaticus,"""Oh look EF is doing another unboxing again, I wonder when are the reviews coming back""

I had the DP-X1 for two years and I needed a replacement. The audio output ports are loose, volume wheel doesn't respond, and the screen protector is cracked. Despite my poor experience with the previous player, one thing I really liked was how well it performs acoustically. Its true balanced output (operated by twin Sabre DACs) is way better than the AK380 and even edges out Chord Mojo's single end performance. It has enough power to drive all my IEMs, and there is absolutely zero audible hissing noises, all of which are good indications of the fantastic audio design of the old player. So, with my firm loyalty to the performance of the old player, I took the plunge and bought the DP-X1A.

been on Ana boxing streak and this video is no exception I'll be unboxing yet another audio gear but this time I'm not unboxing and flagship or ratchet or even from the past but rather a digital audio player this is the onkyo DPX 1a you a high res Android based digital audio player or da P for short released last year this is the successor to the DP x1 which I also have here as you can see is really beat up there are noticeable cracks on the screen and scratches around the body as well as a black tape stuck to the top this one is so beat-up that's the volume wheel doesn't even work and the balanced output port is so loose that most of the time I can't hear anything from the right side I had to shove in some needles to push the ports in order to fix them in place that's why the black tape is there by the way I needed the replacement at the DP x1 a seems to be the best fit despite my less than ideal experience with the previous version so I bought it anyway I still have the DP X 1 box lying around even though I bought it back in summer 2016 yeah I know there are really no reason for anyone to do this I don't know why I'm holding these boxes but that's because I still have it I figured it might be cool to do a small comparison between the two as you know this very quickly they are basically the same I'm pretty sure they use the same product shot on the front but they did move the high-res logo all the way to the top right corner because it is such a big can deal and instead they put x1 a at where the logo was supposed to be what about the top high fidelity audio player while they are completely identical left-side pure sound since 1946 that of course is the founding year of Akio but yeah it's the same on both boxes what about the back they are slightly different actually it says the DP x1 a uses twin Dax and supports Google Play with a spin and Android device unknown this is great because this means you can use streaming services like Spotify and tidal as well as apps like Mora to buy songs below the product description we can see some specs regarding the player the only differences here are that the new version has doubled the internal storage at 6 for gigs not super important because most people buying discolored devices uses microSD cards anyway because losses files are so damn big especially the high-res ones also they downgraded the Android version from android 5.1 to android 5.1.1 thank you so much on you I didn't want to use a new operating system anyway and it's not like we had Android 8.1 last year anyway actually I think they made a mistake here I checked both players out to the unboxing and they're both running 5.1.1 I don't know why they you've changed it in the specs but whatever now something I'm ecstatic to see is that there is indeed a huge improvement to battery life the new version uses the same battery as before but now you get an extra 6 out of high res playback time and of course this also means when you're not playing high res files you should get an even bigger increase that's super awesome because I always found the old version to diversify quickly even when I do another thing I notice is that now they also explicitly stated the nucleus of those mqa even though the old one already supports it I had a look at the bottom of box surprisingly they are the same Wow what about the right side yes so the externals are practically identical you can't forget any lazier than this oh well it's what's inside the cows right the Box lights from the right just like that and now this box actually smells so good I think on cue she gets into the fragrance business hack outside this box into incense or something that's just nothing on this black box at all and it looks like the monolith from 2001 a Space Odyssey I love that movie crap now I don't know if I should turn it into the monolith of incense I open up the box it opens like a book actually the player is on the left in plastic wraps but I want to check out the right side first once again the right side swings open like the door as well and inside we can find a QuickStart guide as well as a bunch of papers that nobody really cares instead of my inside voice of my Oakley untouched and it's just an Android device you'll get around without needing any tutorials but look at this they cry so many papers in this plastic bag that really just makes you think why are these even necessary how we supposed to save papers these days and they could honestly just put all this crap on the Internet right that's also a USB cable in the same compartments I don't know why I bother to take it out I mean it's just a freakin USB cable what the hell is wrong with me alright let's check out the player I removed the plastic bag which actually felt awkwardly satisfying and yeah it really feels like the Oh plate on the hand but something I noticed is that the nucleus seemed to be just a little bit lighter than the old one to just be placebo to be honest we audio found some really Prada bags as much as we hate to admit I have the O player lying around so of course the next logical thing to do is a side-by-side comparison the front looks the same to me the left sides look a little different to me at first I thought the cavity is more dramatic on the new player but nope they're actually the same the bottom reads twin DAC by the way sorry for covering it up with my thumb the back looks the same we have the onkyo logo on the bottom left and a weird black bar at the bottom however I do think the texture is different the new one feels a tad bit rougher than the old one the old one almost feels like a completely smooth surface is super violent but I like the difference what about the right side of the player once again we still have the same power button play pause previous track next track as well as two micro SD card slot however I did notice that the markings on the new one actually do look a bit sharper and finally the bottom of the play is identical to the old one the mini USB port is in the same spot it says it is made in China on the top right corner at the bottom you can see the model of the player I press the power button to try to boot the player I spotted the first boot to take some time so I waited for a while and boy did I wait it actually took so long that I decided to look at the external to try to find other differences I tried turning the volume wheel and was very pleased to find us the button is a lot stiffer and there is more of a distinct click compared to the old one I hope this is an indication that's the volume wheel is more durable than before the top of build players are different as well the left side shows the model of each player and more noticeably they use a black metal plate rather than the silver metal plates on the old one I do think it makes the play of cleaner looking so I dig it now by the way you might be able to see those needles I was talking about I jammed them into the grooves to containing the points in order to tighten them up I ran out of things to look at on the outside so I wanted to look at the inside except I can't because it is still freakin booting Jesus Christ I was so bored that I even went back to the leaflets because what the hell am I supposed to do otherwise one of the papers is actually a leafless for e on cue music and online music store that allows you to buy high res audio tracks with this you can not only buy western music but you can also buy Japanese music which is great because they are usually really hard to find anywhere else I don't care about high rest one single bit but I do care about buying lots of strikes it just doesn't make sense to buy expensive audio gear just to listen to highly compressed or pulley master albums that's all so this piece of paper that's basically the size of a bed sheet as well as a paper for registering your new purchase now mine's Japanese because I bought this in Japan back in July from Yoda boshy with tax rebates and UnionPay discount I only had to pay around 390 US dollars rather than the 630 u.s. dollars price in Hong Kong even if I went for parallel imports in Hong Kong I would still have to pay an extra 40 US dollars compared to what I actually paid buying from your machine the only downside is that you have to play a dust break fix England's would be a huge pain because it would require me to physically go to Japan for repair but I trust own use products so I'm not too concerned at last the TV x1a finally booted the Sutter process is just like any other Android devices so I'll just speed up [Music] and there we have it the UI is very similar to this stock and dry which I don't mind I just need this thing to play music and maybe browse YouTube every once in a while the app drawer is very generic and as you can see you can add some widgets and stuff here's the DPX one for comparison they basically copy and pasted the layout from the old one which is a bit lazy but if it ain't broke don't fix it I'll show you what the player at looks like it's a modified version of the onkyo hf player that you can buy or try on Google Play app on boot-up it tells me to choose the headphone type I don't know what this is supposed to do but I'm surprised they still don't have the in 900m as an option oh well now if you've used the DPS one before this place should be extremely familiar to you you could access the internal storage of the two microSD cards from here and you can choose a folder to play a specific track or just play the whole folder I find out the options for a quick look in particular I was interested in the sound settings one of the coolest things about these on QD ApS is that you can customize the outputs on a very technical level you can choose the digital filter to make the sound smoother or sharper you can adjust the lock range to change the tolerance for time delay relative to the crystal oscillator or something like that you can also increase the gain setting for any earphones or headphones that are hard to drive it's all the same from the old player so I think this is a good place to wrap up the video I think overall we can all agree that the packaging and the player itself are all vastly unchanged but there are some subtle yet welcomed changes that might just make the DPX 1a a worthy patches I might make a video in the future the further compared this play with the ODP x1 so definitely stay tuned if you're in the market for a new player or waiting for someone to convince you that the DPX 1a is a good upgrade if you enjoyed this video please leave a like comment or even subscribe to this channel as a small channel every bit of support goes a long way to motivates me to bring more exciting content

I love high resolution audiophile music, and today we're reviewing the Astell&Kern AK100 32GB HD Music Player from iriver. But first, a little background information is in order. After all, a high definition music player needs...well, music. And that's where HDTracks comes in. We've been big fans of HDTracks.com, a website where you can download high definition 24-bit/192kHz studio master-quality versions of your favorite music. HDtracks was founded by David and Norman Chesky who also own and operate Chesky Records, the Grammy Award winning record label. I'm not sure how many high-resolution songs HDTracks has in its catalogue, but the website lists over 5,000 artists if that gives you any idea. Many tracks are straight studio masters ripped to high definite FLAC and other formats, while others vary in both source and quality-but it's a great start and something all audiophiles should investigate.

folks at emote IVA maybe it's time to rethink high-end hey Andrew - here for high resolution audio file music and audio holux for that matter today we're reviewing the Estelle and Kern thank you stellen Kern a que 132 gigabyte HD music player from iRiver but first a little background information is in order after all a high-definition music player needs well music and that's where HD Trax comes in and we've been fans of HD tracks calm a website where you can download high-definition 24 bit 192 kilohertz Soo Do master quality versions of your favorite music HD Trax was founded by David and Norman Chesky who also own and operate Chesky records they Grammy award-winning record label now I'm not sure how many high-resolution songs HD tracks has in its catalog but the website lists over 5000 artists if that gives you any idea many tracks are straight studio masters ripped to high-definition flock in other formats while others vary in both source and quality but it's a great start and something all audio files should investigate of course with all that great music the problem becomes the playback device if you think your iOS device or Android phone is a high quality music player then I would humbly ask if you also think that a Big Mac represents the pinnacle delivery method for a good beef so how do you playback high-definition music well there are only a handful of hardware devices in the market that aren't tied to a PC and most of those are dedicated music servers there's the Oppo bdp one of the five blu-ray player and this the Estelle and Kern is a vast l austell still you're not saying okay Estelle and Kerr take a 100 portable music player now the a K 100 promise is unadulterated delivery a mastering quality sound at up to 24 bit 192 kilohertz resolution that's equivalent to the high resolution files that come out of the mastering studio so let's take a look at the player now it is really small and portable actually a lot tinier than I had expected it's a touchscreen device that's housed on a black brushed aluminum closure as you can see it's about the size of a couple of match bought cars or the size of seven folded $100 bills good it's really simple to use not much complexity very intuitive you charge and load the player using the micro USB port player turns on and off with the top right power button buttons on the left of the unit provides skip and plate and pause functions and a rotating knob on the right provides an analogue control for the digital volume which can be adjusted in half decibel steps from 0 to 75 now the touchscreen very intuitive very much like an Apple product Apple product no no it's it's it's it's it's it's better it's it's much better it's it's it's never even heard of an Apple product when you look at this thing anyway the menu is pretty straightforward too and though some parts can be at a confusing at times it's pretty good music quality was fantastic I used a pair of Dan on a HD 7100 headphones for my evaluation now the a K 100 is a purist playback device I got to test out several 24 bit 192 kilohertz tracks and storms are on the ocean by Amber rube art her delicate vocals could be perceived with every nuance and the acoustic guitar and violin came through with a remarkably low noise floor and tons of dynamic range the tenor sax played by New York saxophonist Devon Jackson in in a mellow tone was so dynamic I actually had to turn the volume down and that's something that almost never happens when I listen to mp3s or actually even most CD RIPTA music this player is remarkable and it costs $700 oh my oh $700 what a bargain seriously it's it's a great deal it's a steal even not a steal no not a I would never dream of anyway this is where we do need to be clear this is your fathers mp3 music player that is if your father could care less for cameras and apps and really just loves portable high quality music playback this is not a product for the masses it's gonna appeal to a small group of dedicated enthusiasts who simply want a way to bring that level of sound quality with them and who aren't satisfied with the cheap tax and mass market circuitry that you usually find the ak-104 example has 120 DB of crosstalk separation it has 110 DB signal-to-noise ratio the THD is just point zero zero zero nine percent and jitter is just ninety picoseconds rms it does all this with the Wolfson WM 8740 deck the same digital audio converter found in our cumin Linn products and other high-end AV receivers so it's okay if you don't want to spend $700 on the a K 100 we get it but if you want to make the best sound you can hear portable then this is the way to do it or you could hold out for the a K 120 which will retail for around $1,300 good lord Oh 30 it's it's $1300 like I said it adds things like gapless playback doubles the DAX one for each channel has 64 gigs of internal storage and comes with an Italian leather case almost makes the 8100 feel like a bargain almost would you pay more for a higher quality portable music player or are the iPod and similar products enough for you that's our question of the video so please let us know by commenting here or on our

with various devices they're by far the easiest device to use with is an iOS device so that's an iPad I mean this is an old iPod Touch second generation with the 30-pin adapter and that works perfectly fine you just plug it straight in and all the audio gets piped through here so you get all the benefits of this headphone amplifier now the you also use a lightning cable with it as well which works perfectly fine with Windows you have to install drivers and a piece of Sony's software and then it it manages to push all of the audio from windows through it so you can play high res audio and everything else anyway part of the battle with iOS because it's a more closed system although not so much these days but to get files on I mean obviously in the Windows computer you can just drag and drop and it's very very simple with iOS I found that there's a Sony high res audio piece of software which is called Music Center which is this one here and this allows you to copy files over I mean it actually reads the audio files that are on your device but it also allows you to use iTunes to copy files over so what I thought I'd try is let's launch i-tunes let's move a few of these things out of the way so if I plug in plug my iPad in and then click on the iPad there we go we don't any new software file-sharing I think it was yes a Music Center comes up you can see it here as an app so let's click on that and then I guess I'm dragging files into that yeah so add files actually let's try and see if we can drag in because I've got the files here so here's some high res audio there's some prints tracks and some Lake Street dive tracks so if I select those and drag them nice thing about this is that a lot of the other high res audio players you have to you have adverts or you have to pay to use them because this is a Sony one not really intended for this use but but I'm guessing is going to work fine so that's copying over quite quickly via lightning some of these files are quite big if I go back to that folder you can see 152 megabytes for that track and so quite quite large so that looks like that's copied over yeah those are all in there so now what I'll do is I Jack the iPad and we'll have a look and see no I did there oh no I do right so go back so songs yeah a newly added song so it's actually in there yeah so we can see that it says high res audio next to the track I wonder if it tells us transfer so detailed information well there you go that's cool oh yeah so 96 kilohertz 24-bit and so that's the Lake Street dive album that I had and let's try the print strikes and see detailed information 192 kilohertz 24-bit so that's the highest audio quality that this headphone amplifier will cope with so let's go ahead and plug that in okay so here's how we plug in just a normal Lightning connection that you can get that you get with your iPad or iPhone and that goes into the headphone amplifier into the ordinary USB socket there switch on and you'll get a green light on here and I just got it for the purpose in this video and going through a three and a half mil jockey into the Bose speaker just so you can hear it really so it looks like quite a nice no simply lay down app I mean it's obviously designed for phone rather than iPad but yes so we're going to songs now this will have all the songs that are on my device you can create playlists on here as well so I think how do we do play this create a new playlist so if I do playlist and let's call this high-res and then we'll pick some tracks to put on it well there's the Prince track make Street dive that's high-res as well I res and there's one more so that's all the high-res tracks that are on here so that's put in a playlist there you go it keeps the album artwork it looks like as well so if I start to play a track [Music] must have press that twice so basically that's how how you get it to work with the Sony app and so there's no adverts you can put whatever songs you want on there it supports loads of different formats so definitely the easiest way of doing it obviously this would be your headphones plugged in I've got some so meizu headphones HD 50s which actually sound really lovely with this headphone amplifier they really sound a lot better now the headphone amp probably warrants better headphones again but it really has breathed new life into those major headphones which sounded decent already I've got some of the Sony one of these MDR tens MDR 10 our C's which are high res audio headphones but they interestingly sound nowhere near as good as my amazing headphones there they're just nowhere near as detailed even though they support the wider frequency response but then obviously my ears probably don't handle the wider frequency response because I'm a no spring chicken but so that that's the easiest way you can also use if you just use an ordinary 30 pin cable that will go through the headphone amplifier in exactly the same way so again really simple to set up all the audio is just going out of the iPod whatever sounds it makes even if you're playing a game so if I put let's put some tracks on here you can see it says dock connector on there so the audio is coming through there [Music] and again you can't really tell because I'm playing it or a speaker so it defeats the object but this is more about showing you how it works with all sorts of devices so basically you just using the ordinary Apple cable straight through and any audio this makes will come through actually in something interesting that I know it aside from this but I might as well say it now if I start playing a track nice to see Billy Ray Cyrus on there right so if I start playing a track the this is something really nice about the older iPods is that the airplay icon comes up straight away and rather than having to go through that audio menu I quite like the older way of doing it so if I put it on my home pod speaker agonising quick and it's doesn't coming out of my home pod speaker so that's my super old device and it's worth so little but I like coming back to it and it's surprisingly smooth and still works really well anyway this is more about a headphone amplifier so let's get rid of that okay so something else I found out the Sony Music hat place high res audio files but it also joins the tracks together which is great if you've got an album where you know to continuous mix you don't get those gaps and some other audio players I've had before have put spaces in between those tracks but this plays 192 kilohertz 24-bit tracks and there's knows no gap so I've read the instructions and I've tried to get this working with my Mac basically you just plug in the USB plug it into the input socket on the front here which is that one and then switch it on so that's powering up but what should happen now is when I click on output I should get different options and I should be able to pick the Sony head ah fire there but that for some reason isn't working now this is an old Mac 2010 but it's a slightly older headphone adapter I'm running the latest software so I don't quite know why that works but but it doesn't work on my Mac but I'm not too worried because I use it on my iPad or my phone mostly but that's that one so this is my sony am playing back through a Windows 10 tablet so ever plug in the micro USB you can use the this cable with an ordinary Windows computer so that will plug into the input socket and into the computer there but obviously this has got only micro USB on it so I'll plug in using the proprietary connector and here you can see Sony headphone amplifier has come up that says default device already so that's that's picked it on its own so that's all good windows want some base nevermind so a music centre that's the Sony program you've got a high def you as unlike Windows 10 updates they do they do seem to happen all the time right it's I've used this program before some surprises coming up with a message yeah we can and I tried this with high res audio files before not the nicest piece of software to use well I suppose it would be better on a desktop you know we touch control on this small device is not good at all so let's start playing a track after double tap [Music] okay so that's it flame of Windows using this Sony Music Center for PC software but it will also work with ordinary audio as well so you can send all your audio through this obviously you wouldn't normally use a speaker but putting that through headphones to enhance the audio so if you're watching something on YouTube so a music clip then it'll add to that as well [Music] okay so that's it running through windows and also running through iOS okay so that's the device it is a great device the audio quality from this is incredible it it really improves the audio output on if I plug headphones into a PC or plug them into my iPad iPod or phone anything that's played through this just is has so much more space so much more depth to the bass and it doesn't matter if it's not high res audio if you just want better quality audio and I'm using you know amazing HD 50 headphones which I think cost about 60 pounds something like that so they're not expensive headphones but it's improved and no end I'm going to try some much higher quality headphones to see if the difference is even more but already it sounds completely different to two headphones that I've listened to before so yeah as a device I love it it's great and at the end of this I'm going to try and do some audio recordings where I record the audio from my phone output and also from this out and just do a comparison on the end is not it's not scientific it's obviously you're listening to it through YouTube maybe through headphones would be obviously a lot better than listening through a phone speaker or a computer speaker but just for a bit of fun alright thanks very much for watching Oh you I got a flavor the hair on my shoulder it's fairing it's there and it's both like I show you MacArthur look folder on my shoulder yo - breathe your breath of fresh air to me yo - breathe your breath of fresh air to me I've never seen a diamond in the flesh I cut my teeth on wedding rings I've never seen a diamond in the flesh I cut my teeth on wedding rings you

of the consumer world I'm father Robert Valles era the digital Jesuit now you may notice that I'm not Leo Laporte well that's because we asked Leo to take it easy he's been hosting this show for the better part of three years and we wanted him to relax so we gave him this this is a high-res all-aluminum audio player we said leo takes some time exercise and just enjoy yourself so let's take a look at the file working out huh and you know when you're working out you'll want to listen to some tunes I'm not listening to my iphone though I'm not listening to my iPod either I'm not even listening to my fancy Dan Neil Young pono player I'm listen to something brand-new my review today is of this let me take the headphones out and show you my new fiyo x1 it's in the silicone case I do that keep it from getting wet and it's sealed all around which is kind of nice just exposure to the click wheel and the screen inside a really pretty aluminum solid aluminum case this is a high-res music player so it can play back any kind of digital file I have not just AAC and mp3s but it'll even playback FLAC the lossless compression flack apple lossless and it'll playback bit rates up to 192 kilohertz 24-bit I mean the highest quality high-res files now a portable audio player like this wouldn't be any good if it didn't sound good and they put some pretty good hardware inside of here hyoh chose to use the Texas Instruments 15:42 digital to analog converter it's a new part audio files haven't really weighed in on it yet but it does have 112 DB signal-to-noise that's very good a lot better than an iPhone for instance maybe not as good as some of the higher-end audio file decks but this is a high quality deck with a nice also a very good headphone amplifier in here that's able to power even high quality headphones I've been using my Etta modak vo our fours these are excellent in ear monitors but it'll even power my high impedance headphones like my magnetic plane our high Fineman headphones which which take a lot of juice I think they're 35 ohm headphones it's a high impedance and there's enough juice here to listen at normal even somewhat loud listening volumes the controls are good this has not a touchscreen but a nice color screen that has a fairly useful interface lots of good stuff to gapless playback that something Neil's pono player doesn't do it also has a 7 channel equalizer with presets and boy look at all the buttons this not only is there an on/off button but volume up and down previous channel next track back and Settings button and the scroll wheel I'm like the iPod actually Scrolls you can even hit the the big fat click wheel so in some ways there's actually a duplication of functionality but that's fine I find it very easy to use very easy to find what I want the screen displays album art in color also bitrate information I think this is well-made this is a you know kind of a post iPod portable audio player I saved the best for last the final x1 is $100 $100 now that doesn't include storage in a way I kind of like this idea it uses microSD cards and you supply your own SD cards up to 128 gigabytes so I bought a SAN disc under 28 gig microSD card for a hundred bucks so $200 total for storage and the BIOX one nice though you can have multiple SD cards one free you work out one for chi'lan you know and that's that's kind of cool certainly enough to store as big a music library as you'd want $100 for this so let me give you the pros and the cons but for that I think I need to retire to my relaxation zone after a workout it's so great to relax in the hot tub with your tunes and the x1 comes along with me thanks to that silicon wrapper it's a waterproof but at least it keeps splashes off of it and notice it's even powerful enough to drive these high impedance HiFi man hg 560 headphones at a reasonable level that's pretty sweet probably shouldn't wear those in the hot tub though let's take off the silicone wrapper and give you the pros and cons on the finest x1 pro well it stands right out at you it's beautifully designed this is aluminum the functions are easy to use we're in the post ipod ER people pretty much understand how one of these is supposed to work I love the return of the click wheel it's kind of rubberized feels great the big button makes it very easy to use it doesn't have a hold button but when you press the on/off power switch if you turn off you don't see the screen but also the buttons become inactive so it doesn't really need a hold switch it I like the software I love the equalizer the gapless playback Dark Side of the Moon baby awesome and it's great that I can do both line out and headphone out one Jack the USB micro USB port means I can charge it with pretty much anything and that's both charging and data which is nice so if you don't have a micro SD card reader don't don't worry you just plug it into your computer copy your files onto it 11 hours battery life and FiOS says they're gonna get to 15 with a firmware update that's more than enough for me on the cons there's only a cowl I left out the most important Pro the price a hundred bucks on the cons of course it does include headphones but for a hundred bucks you have a little extra to buy some high-end headphones you're not gonna want your Apple earbuds in this you need some good high fidelity in ear monitors to really get the most out of it it also doesn't include any memory but I think that's great it gives me the flexibility to buy one or more micro SD cards to fit my needs and with 128 gigs of storage and the player I'm still only paying $200 that's half the pono player okay maybe the file x1 doesn't sound as good to those golden ears as the pono player I really can't tell sounds great to me and it could play back all my files even the high-res ones it's a definite buy for the file x1 so I'm gonna chill out relax listen to some tunes and send it back to you father Robert you you you you you can't tell him naked in here can you huh yeah okay so now I know why it says naked aluminum on the sheet that was a Leo Laporte with the file x1 high res audio player thank you very much for that comprehensive review leo and you go on relaxing make sure you relax a lot and next time work on the crop a little bit all right so uh when we come back we've got plenty more we're gonna be looking at cell phones for people who are tired of big screens now it's not that simple I mean I know there are people who like all different types of phones and if you've gotten tired with the space race to get bigger and bigger screens and you're tired of looking like you hold a tablet up to your head you're gonna want to take out Merriam's review of the Sony experience the latest and greatest from the gizmos is over there but before we do that let's go ahead and talk about something that I hold near and dear to my heart because I was at CES this year and at CES one of the big buzzwords was automation specifically home automation how do you make your home smart now there were a lot of solutions at the show and most of them acquired you to use your home and your appliances and your things in the way that they wanted you to use I mean it's only natural they they design it they create it they make it so you use it that way but you could do it a different way you could do it the smartthings way a smart things quite simply is a way to speak to everything it doesn't matter what equipment you use it doesn't matter what you want to automate it doesn't really matter what you buy because smart thing speaks to it all that's right it's seen its highest rated smart home system it allows you to monitor control and automate your home from anywhere using your smartphone now your lights your locks your thermostats your home security are all connected through a single app I think about that it's a single pane of glass to control everything in your house it has intuitive control that allow you to set the rules on your smart home through their free iOS Android and Windows Phone apps and with smart things you can customize the way your smart devices talk to each other so now you can tap goodnight on your phone and the lights will turn off the thermostat will adjust and the doors will lock you can set your lamps to brighten each morning at sunrise or when you want to right wake up you could even keep your home protected with smart things with home security motion detection water detection and more now Brian go ahead and go to the table here because I want to show you some of the things that smart home can give you for your smart home smart things that this this is the hub this is where it all starts but all of these sensors around me allow you to customize your smart home the way that you want it to work for example I could have this present sensor on me so that when I walk towards my home it automatically knows that it should unlock my doors it should change the thermostat it should turn on my Sonos system it should look at the Dropcam to make sure that no one's lurking in my entryway these are all the rules that you could work with for example if you want to integrate this with with a ifti I call a nifty now it's it's not just that it works with these modules it works with the home automation that you already have and that really is the genius of the smart things smart home again smart things was named CES 2015 editor's choice award so if you are looking at a home automation system something for your Internet of Things this is where you need to go now to get you started setting up your smart home right now smart things is offering before you buy listeners 10% off any home security or solutions kit and you get free shipping in the United States when you go to smart things comm slash twit and use the offer code Twitter check check out that smart things comm slash twit and we thank smart things for their support before you buy now let's get back to it again I like big screens but some people don't like having a laptop in their pocket that's why we had Nerium jawar take a look at the new Sony Xperia for those people who want something a bit more petite hey there it's Mariam Schwar for byb and this is the sony xperia z3 compact yes compact that's why it looks so small next to my gigantic head but you know what there's a lot to be said about flagship devices that are compact and this is one of the few right now if you want a flagship phone you can't get anything that's easy as small and five inches really and this is the one of the few and probably the only one that doesn't sacrifice in any way shape or form on specs and performance I really like this phone this is really really good device so let me walk you through it a little bit this is a cool orange color it comes in a bunch of different colors if you go to Sony's website be aware this is sold unlocked in the u.s. through various retailers including Sony I believe Amazon as well and I don't have an exact price point but it's around $450 which is really quite affordable for fully fledged device with working LTE bands for the US and a very nice version of Android very little contamination in terms of you know manufacturer or carrier obviously no carrier software of any kind whatsoever and it's running the latest well not quite the latest it's not the latest Android but it's four point four point something so it's it's pretty good let me walk you through a little bit so you can have an idea what's in the package and so you can understand this is actually really worthwhile in terms of being a flagship device first you got the display it's a gorgeous display it's only 720p four point six inches but it's got Sony's triluminos technology I believe it's called and what it is is it enhances you know the the brightness the colors the blacks are really black which is really beautiful because this is not an OLED panel it's an IPS panel you can see here the the colors are you know it's kind of just floating on top of the display very very nicely made you've got the usual sensors and and and speakers and stuff you've got a speaker right on top the sony logo here 2 megapixel front-facing camera you got another speaker at the bottom and if you flip it over it you get the PS the resistance just like the z3 non-compact this phone has a 20 megapixel camera yes 20 by default is shoots at 8 megapixels and actually recommend you leave it that mode because it adds a whole bunch of functionality like image stabilization auto HDR a bunch of other really helpful things so the camera you know looks great on paper but it's I would say one of the better ones but not nearly as great as Sony would like you to believe it also shoots 4k which is pretty awesome in terms of specs internally you've gotten a snapdragon 801 two gigs of ram and only 16 gigabytes of storage but thankfully there's a micro SD card slot so you're not completely stuck with terms of storage but that's one of the areas that I think Sony could have done a better job you got an LED flash obviously and FC all the things you bells and whistles you'd expect what is cool is that if you do a tour of the sides here on the right-hand side there's a power key volume rocker but there's also a dual detent camera button so you know you can take a photo by just half clicking and then for focus and fully clicking I think every Android phone should come with this very few do but if you're into photography this is a really major thing to have on the bottom you get a microphone a nice little spot to put a lanyard I wish more phones went back to doing this a lot of phones used to have a lanyard hole and it's nice you don't drop your phone if you have it especially when you're taking photos and you know you're on a boat or something put the strap around you nothing bad happens on top you've got obviously the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack secondary microphone for noise reduction and you know that's it essentially on the left-hand side of a bunch of ports and so this is interesting this phone is water-resistant you can immerse it in a sink or like a do the dishes with it drop it in the sink when you do the dishes nothing Bad's gonna happen as long as these flaps are closed there's two flaps on the left-hand side one on top which has the micro USB and the SD card slot micro SD and then on the bottom there's the one that's actually interestingly not labeled but underneath it is where you'll find the nano SIM for this phone so it's a nano SIM I think more and more devices seems to be headed in that direction so you probably have to get used to it and of course closing these these little flaps is important because that's what the water is is all about so just be careful that you closed it properly there's also a custom connector it's magnetic it's for a dock that Sony makes I've never seen it in person and you know I've seen a lot of Sony products so don't come this being quite useful but in terms of this overall this phone you know if you're looking for a high-end phone but you have small hands or you don't want to go for something that's going to take up a lot of real estate this is this is the phone you know it's four point six inch 720p display it could be 1080p I guess but at four point six inches it's really not a big deal and most importantly it saves battery to have less pixels to to drive and speaking of battery this is a twenty five hundred or so milliamp hour battery battery life is great if it's not dragon negative one is very efficient so it's kind of the best of both worlds I like high-end phones as you know and again the camera really you know is it's being push really hard by Sony but honestly I think if this had oh is optical image stabilization which is really a technology that's becoming more more popular on high-end phones this might actually be my daily driver this would probably be the phone I use every day for me as a photography buff the UIs is really what's missing from this device but other than that everything about it is delightful so pros as I said top specs small water-resistant are probably the big three and it's I think a really beautiful design the fact that you get a very plain version of Android to work with no no no glut here and cons you know probably the camera not that it's a bad camera don't get me wrong it'll definitely get the job done but Sony has heiped the camera so much that it just doesn't live up to the oh my god 20 megapixel because it lacks OIS in closing to me the Sony Xperia z3 compact is an absolute no doubt by it's probably one of the top five or ten phones on the market today comes in funky colors is small compact beautiful you know Sony's done a really good job at not cutting any corners on this except for perhaps oh is on the camera so there you have it the sony xperia z3 compact here on before you buy I'm Mariam Schwar and I'll catch you next time that's Miriam jawar with a buy for the Sony Xperia z3 compact so if you're taking a look at a smaller phone who knows maybe that's your next purchase now coming up next we asked Jason Howell to take a look at the Dell Venue 8 this is it looks like a standard 8 inch tablet but this thing has an absolutely gorgeous screen the question is whether or not that's going to impress a man who takes a look at these day in and day out so without further ado hey Jason tell us all about the venue it was up I'm Jason Howell and I am here with the Dell Venue 8 7000 this is Dells new tablet they unveiled it at CES this year and had a lot of buzz around it because of its thin profile you'll see it's very very thin I'll talk about that here in a second it's $399 you can pick it up at dell.com so let's take a look at the specs it's an 8.4 inch o le d-- 2560 by 1600 resolution tablet that's 361 pixels per inch it's running an intel atom z3580 2.3 gigahertz quad-core CPU it's a 64-bit chip inside there so it'll be 64-bit capable when lollipop comes around which Dell actually says is going to be soon it's running KitKat right now which is kind of unfortunate that they didn't launch with lollipop but that's just how it goes it has 2 gigs of RAM inside 16 gigs of internal storage does have a micro SD card slot that's expandable to 512 gigs on the side so you can pack a lot of storage in there if you want to now it has an 8 megapixel rear facing camera up at the top there but you also notice two other cameras on the side these are both 720p cameras that are included for depth sensing and then down at the bottom of the tablet you can see that there is a single 2 megapixel front-facing camera shooting forward has have stereo speakers as well on one side of the tablet and a 50 900 milliamp hour battery all right so let's take a look at the design first and foremost it's definite key feature here is that it's thin it's the world's thinnest tablet as Dell says and pretty light as well thinnest it's right around six millimeters and that's thinner than a pencil still feels pretty solid definitely a solid build it's an anodized aluminum body there's front-facing stereo speakers like I said they're loud enough the only problem with the stereo speakers is that they're only stereo when you're in portrait mode you go in the landscape for a movie or a gaming and suddenly the stereo speakers are kind of pointless it's just on one side of the screen kind of a bummer the buttons on the side are pretty stable have nice kind of a nice feel to them and they feel super sturdy but maybe it's just a little bit too flush I'd say but overall they're all right thin bezels all around as you can see here but obviously the bottom of bezel is the large one and that's just because it's packing everything else it's got the cameras built into it the speaker's everything you need inside that single portion of the tablet and I would say the design in general has pretty sharp edges so if you're holding on to it for a long enough period of time it starts to kind of wear on your hands overall design looks nice I don't know if it's the most functional design in the world I did register some phantom touches on the sides because of the thin bezels at time so consider that as for the display I definitely say it's the key feature of this device there isn't a whole lot to say about it other than that it's excellent it's vibrant saturation is is a little strong but still there's enough detail in there and things look good so I'd say it's definitely a strong point of the tablet performance wise did a you know web browsing which I actually put it through the verge test switch to desktop mode to see how well it did I'd say it performed pretty well more or less on the verge site as well as you know just general web browsing gaming played some games my favorite to test right now is Riptide g2 and it's you know it I thought it was pretty sturdy pretty stable on gaming though the device did heat up a little bit for over prolonged use battery efficient definitely battery efficient through I was able to get through a couple of days of using this as my regular tablet so good there I'd say overall few minor issues with performance here and there but I was pretty happy with it all right now let's move on to the cameras which I would definitely say is kind of one of Dell's key features here it has the intel realsense cameras built in that's the two cameras on the side and then the camera up at the top this camera up at the top is the main camera and that's what you see through the camera app and that you take pictures through these other cameras are there and you can preview them through the app while you're taking pictures but they're pretty much just providing depth information into the photo allowing you to kind of go back and do some you know rack rack blurs and that sort of stuff unfortunately the position of the camera is down at the bottom so if you want to take pictures you actually do have to rotate it upside down and they advise you of doing that which isn't a deal-breaker as you can see the desktop actually repositions itself when it's upside down it's just kind of awkward to do and then of course you have these the power buttons and volume buttons down here that you're managing around and you press the wrong thing and suddenly you know the volume goes down the screen goes off so just kind of gotta keep that in mind when you're taking pictures definitely the depth sensing technology requires a lot of really good light and it has a requirement of objects being three to sixteen feet away and it's kind of a sweet spot it takes a little practice to get in there and even when I got it I wouldn't say that it necessarily looked amazing I had a couple pictures that looked okay with it and then just general gripe with cameras on tablets is that low-light performance just the image quality in general is never 100% a little grainy and just not the best as for the software this is running KitKat and it's a pretty unchanged version of KitKat you can see just kind of bouncing through that everything looks pretty stock pretty standard to the way Google designed KitKat a few touches here and there but not a whole lot there are a few Dell apps built in some of which I've shown off already the camera app that supports the realsense depth cameras there's the gallery that you can actually sync Google+ Facebook and Dropbox inside that app and also use some of its advanced photo editing feature you know that Instagram effect there's Dell live wallpaper which you can kind of see on the background right now I have a little bit of wallpaper that when I move you get a little parallax view it's subtle and it's neat and the Dell live wallpaper app allows you to select a few of those and then my Dell is the support app which kind of gives you some diagnostic access there and finally the Dell cast and this is an app that we're gonna go into just really quick here it's an $80.00 dongle HDMI dongle that Dell sells is an additional accessory and this tablet can be used as basically a desktop computer you plug that HDMI dongle into the back of a TV you sync it up with a wireless keyboard and mouse and plug it all in and run the Dell cast app on here and voila your tablet now becomes a desktop environment on any external TV that has a HDMI input and I would say my experience is pretty laggy pretty fiddly it's all wirelessly done so you know random issues arise and you get little break ups and pixelation and all that kind of stuff and ultimately I'm just not convinced in Android in the desktop environment I feel like it just makes things you know their aim is to make things more productive I feel like it just kind of slows me down I'm sure over time maybe I get used to it a little bit more but I'm not sure I give it that time because of my time playing with it it just wasn't that successful in convincing me that it needed to happen all right so the pros of the Dell Venue 8 7000 it's incredibly thin and incredibly light sand that's nice the display definitely pops got a nice visual representation on the display desktop mode with Dell cast could be a win for some for me I wouldn't say that it was but some people want desktop on Android so there you go and the realsense cameras on the back are definitely different but in the cons I'd say realsense still feels like a gimmick it doesn't feel like a reason to purchase a device just a nice added feature that maybe you're gonna use a little bit more than you think picture quality of course it's a tablet I don't expect a whole lot in image quality but it definitely didn't you know stand up and that awkward chin down at the bottom with the awkward crazy placement of the cameras just kind of gets in the way more often than I would hope now as for my verdict I was kind of hedging between don't buy and trial and because it's not the tablet for me but I do know that a lot of people are looking for Android in a desktop environment maybe that's convenient to them so I'm going to go ahead and give it a try it's four hundred dollars and that's the same cost as a nexus 9 which personally I would buy over the two but if you want Android in a desktop environment if you want to play around with some of the advanced photo features that realsense cameras kind of bring to the table in here then you know definitely take a look this is the Dell Venue 8 7000 for $399 thank you so much for watching my review my name is Jason how you can catch my other reviews on all about Android at twit that TV slash AAA thanks a lot that's the Dell Venue 8 7000 that was Jason Howell our Android expert don't forget you can always find him on all about Android Tuesdays at 5 o'clock and for Android app arena 5 of 4:30 on Wednesdays now he gave it a try but if you are looking for an Android tablet in a desktop format maybe that's gonna be for you we want to do something a little different for this next item most of you who have watched any of my shows know that I'm a big fan of the Acer s7 this is my Ultrabook of choice it's light it's powerful it's beautiful and it's just incredibly well designed I've been rocking this thing for two years but recently I called out over to the folks at Acer and asked them if there was something else that I should be using something I should take a look at and they sent me this now this is just a first look I really want to give you an in-depth look of what this is this is the R 13 this is essentially an upgrade of the r7 that we took a look at what it must have been like 14 months ago it's a new generation of notebooks a convertible now if you were at CES this year going back back out to the wide you you know that this is what happened to tablets tablets all but disappeared from CES and that was because manufacturers are going back to convert slash hydrant notebooks that's exactly what this is it's an easel design so this screen doesn't completely detach from the notebook but what it does do is it allows you to hinge it so that I could put this in a couple of different configurations I could do use it like this if I want to sort of have an easel or or even make it float above the keyboard I could flip it around and it will auto rotate so that I could use it as a presentation space or I can just fold it back on itself to use it as a tablet now the nice thing about designs like this is that it's no longer a compromise in the past it felt as if you were losing a little something-something with your notebook by having a hinge like this but this is a full-featured Windows 8 notebook it's got an Intel 5410 you so it's an it's a very snappy processor eight gigabytes of memory it's got a 2k screen that will do 2560 by 1440 resolution and it's also got a feature that I really like and that is it keeps the raid zero SSD that I found so very useful with the the s7 essentially it's two SSDs that they put together on a board running in performance raid raid zero which just gives you a ridiculous amount of performance out of a 512 gigabyte SSD now one of the other things that they change between this and the r7 is this keyboard is solid I think that was my biggest complaint about the old one which was it felt a little mushy if you didn't hit a key directly it wasn't gonna really go over but this one is sharp it's responsive and combined with the multi-touch touchscreen you know I think this might actually replace my s7 III I'm gonna spend I think the next three weeks or so just putting this through its paces I'm gonna let this become my daily driver here at twit I'm gonna see if it can do everything I needed out of my s7 plus all the features they promised out of an easel PC which includes hanging this over to our crack artist Greg Burnett who's gonna see if maybe the stylus pen that comes with it is is the thing for artists now take a look at this the Acer r-13 I'm gonna give you an honest-to-goodness look a long-term review of whether or not this is going to become the new laptop for Podrick now when we come back we need to take a look at something that's near and dear to my heart and that is stuff in the makerspace specifically we've got Erin Newcombe and the Raspberry Pi - that's right the brand-new version he's gonna let you know if it's something that you should buy if you want to get into making programming and doing yourself but before we do that let's go ahead and thank the second sponsor up before you buy and it's prosper now if you've watched twit you probably know a little bit about prosper prosper is a lending marketplace it's not a traditional place to go when you you need resources prosper is all about going from people who have money to lend to people who need money to be lent to them I'll face it there aren't that many good ways to borrow money when you need it you could call friends you could call family you could put it on your credit card but those just aren't really good especially traditional bank loans which have all sorts of stipulations and take a long long time if you need money quickly for your next project for your next investment for your next thing prosper is the place to go now you can borrow up to thirty five thousand dollars in as few as five days and you can use the money for just about anything you desire to pay off those high rate credit cards to fix up the house and maybe even put it into your business I remember before I entered the priesthood before I was working at Twitter I actually ran my own business and at one point my contracts were such that I had out stretched my cash resources I wished prosper had existed back then because I was forced into the bank shuffle going from bank manager to bank manager trying to show them that I was cash positive I just needed a bridge loan so that I could collect my next month's pay well I wouldn't have to do that with prosper I could go to the people who have that money who understand what I'm trying to do and get the cash that I need to keep doing business really that's what prosper is all about don't rack up more debt on your credit cards you can pay them off with prosper prospers online marketplace does connect those people who have money to lend to those people who need it and what better way can we have it in the generation of the internet to check your low rate instantly right now without a checking without affecting your good

can get up to thirty five thousand dollars in your account in as few as five days and a $50 Visa gift card by going to prosper calm / twit that's right prosper calm / twit for this special offer just for twit viewers do it now Vosper calm / twit and we thank prosper for their support of before you buy let's go ahead and take a look at what the new Raspberry Pi 2 has in stores for makers hi everybody Erin Newcomb here for another review this time it's more technology I love being on byb byb and reviewing all these really cool gadgets this case I'm super excited about this as you can tell this was the Raspberry Pi version 2 you know I was on a while ago I reviewed the Raspberry Pi model a when it came out and at that time you know Abin often from the Raspberry Pi foundation said they weren't going to come out with a new version of the Raspberry Pi be the the one that usually people use for projects and things until like 2017 hello but here it is about six months later and they have indeed come out with the model 2 this is a great little device you can buy it online just about everywhere Amazon or you can buy it directly from a lot of the partners that Raspberry Pi uses to distribute these things so let me just go over what's different about the raspberry pi 2b plus has a really long name what they did in this model is they put in a new broad concha p-- and what that means is that number one it's not running at 700 megahertz anymore it's running at 900 megahertz and they've given you four cores so the previous model was 700 megahertz single core this is 900 megahertz quad core processor that means that there's so much more processing power available for you to use not only that they've added some additional memory so now there's 1 gig of memory on this device which is fantastic almost nothing else changes the device is basically the same it's really easy to identify these by the way because you can see the memory chip right here in the back if you ever wondering if it's a model one or model two version one version two you can always tell by just looking at the back and seeing that little chip there not to mention that it does stay right on the front it's a bottle two but so you have the extra CPU the extra processing power everything else is the same though the form factor is the same you still got the same number of USB ports Ethernet ports audio/video power everything else is the same but it's just much much more powerful what this means in in real life is that you're gonna see a huge jump in boot time loading of programs you're gonna be able to run things that you weren't able to run before I'm really excited about this because I can now run my and all my emulators my video game emulators basically at full speed and not even really tap into the power of this chip it's really really fantastic and I think you're really really gonna love it not only that the only thing that really changes programmatically on this board is there's a new kernel to support the the new CPU other than that everything should run just as it did before on the original model B so you won't have to worry about changing any of your programs all the tutorials out there that you've that you go to to run your projects on these boards won't change you can go do that you just have to make sure that you load the version 4 model 2 which has the updated kernel and that's it that's it everything should run so this is a fantastic board I'm really excited about it in my tests I've been able to see huge jumps in performance boot time let's put this thing boots up way faster them and winters machine does and it boots up about as fast as my Linux machines do so boot time has tremendously improved I think what you'll see in the future is you'll see people modifying their programs to run with the multi-core chip so for right now things will run faster just because you're running on a faster CPU even on a single core but as people start to recompile their programs to take advantage of the multi-core system you're really gonna see the performance jump so I think you're really gonna love this the kicker of this is though and I mentioned this before is that it's $35 still it's always been $35 it's still 35 lawyers but you're getting an incredible bump in performance with this particular this particular platform this upgrade that they've done you're getting a really good performance boost and the price is exactly the same so if you've been holding off that you've been wondering well should I get one should I you know could I ask actually use it as my as my desktop PC or maybe as a desktop PC for for a kid you absolutely can do this now so it's really really wonderful the pros on this thing first of all everything is compatible there's no difference in programmatically except you just have to load the new kernel version when you load your image you'll see that there's a model 2 version and the kernel is really the only thing that's changed secondly the form factor is the same everything stays the same you're getting a ton of performance improvements one core to four core and 512 megabytes to one gigabyte of memory those are the real advantages in terms of cons there's no cons to this go out and buy it enjoy it and you know start hacking on something start creating a project if you were waiting so the performance got better your wait is over go out and buy one of these things today $35 I really think you're gonna love it so once again this is the Raspberry Pi model 2b plus this is Aaron nukem thanks for watching that's Aaron Newcomb and he gives a bye to the Raspberry Pi 2 if you're a maker that's really a no-brainer go pick yourself up one right now and start experimenting now you can always also find Aaron here on the TV network he does floss many days he also does all about Android so just watch twit TV and eventually you'll see Aaron pop up and don't forget he is very heavily involved in the benicio Mini Maker Faire so if you if you feel the maker spirit and you're in the Bay Area why not come out we've got a little something special starting with this new era before you buy we always get products in the backroom that look interesting sometimes but don't really merit a full review we're gonna call it our parting shot and here with our very first parting shot is our very own Meghan Maroney you've got this by robots jeroni thingy yeah throw anything we didn't intend it to be a parting shot although from the beginning when I got this you said it's not so good I mean I said it wasn't for me yeah yeah it's it's a mini drone it can be flown indoors that it's really designed for kids it's it's got a couple of interesting features like the ability to play fighters right you can shoot each other down right but you pointed out that the way it trains people and trains kids it's not great cuz all of the quad copters don't work like this yeah and so a tray can train a child to use it wrong then they get another one and it's just not so great so I went into that but then it was it was fine for my kids for a while and then it's actually this is one of the problems so yeah not flying straight is not a great it's not a great young to have in your product right and we did things like we checked the motor for hairs and that's what happens a lot with these you know they get hairs and the motors buttonhole or let me try it again yeah it's let's see what's gonna go this time all right well well that was the by robots right - because I mean it's not cheap yeah that's the thing I've seen products like this and you can forgive them because they cost twenty thirty dollars I was like okay you break it but this is a little pricey yeah I was like a hundred dollars oh okay that's a problem now now as a mother I know you're always very interested in having products that are safe for your kids that can also teach them things right does this fit in that category at all um not really it wasn't dangerous okay um you know and we didn't put the guides on it because it didn't really fly very well with the guide so it never hurt anyone and and he does you can see I'm not very good at even flying than the ones that are no i I've also noticed this every time you have an impact is battery tends to get knocked yes yeah which is awesome because it means that if you hit a wall you have to go over and pick the thing back up but yeah that not flying straight thing that sounds like a deal breaker yeah it really is especially for kids who are young I mean my boys are nine and they get really frustrated and it's no fun when you spend a hundred dollars on something and it makes them really frustrated yeah so yeah I mean we've had other ones we have the bee copter you know the quadcopter that is gonna be and it's about forty dollars is great see and that's I think that's what kills it it's not that this is a bad thing it's just that for that expense for that price you could get something else that's much much better right and yeah that kind of kills it so I'm not sure if I even have to ask you for this out of a parting shot but it's probably not a buy and it's probably not a try no I mean I like to be nice to everything and I'm you know he tried but I would say no now if we are gonna have another segment on before you buy we're gonna call it Redemption where we're gonna allow manufacturers to come in and maybe they send us a faulty product or maybe they've improved it if if you were gonna take another look at this what would be the thing that you tell by robot that they need to fix before we take another look well I would say for it not to break for the battery for the battery to fit in better maybe a little cheaper if they could I mean we should say you know it's designed for fighting too so it's not you know the with the lasers and everything so I mean those are all great features that had a camera those are great features to keep but I would say a little sturdier yeah that's Megan Maroney this is the by robots drone fighter and this has been before you returned and there goes the battery you you are also all over the TWiT TV network this last week you were really busy because mike was in Barcelona so you had to cover ten shows over the weekend but usually you are our star for tech news tonight which they can find every evening at four o'clock right yeah it's coming up in 20 minutes so yeah and you know for those people who maybe haven't caught tech news tonight maybe they're living in a cave or under a rock what do you say is the thing that should attract them what does tech news tonight give them well just the short bit of the news that you need to hear about in 10 or 15 minutes there you go sometimes 20 depending on how much have to say Meghan Maroney catch her every day four o'clock here at live twit TV and i-5 for the F and I fight for the iPhone I waited on Wednesdays now I want to thank everyone who joined in and especially all of our hosts who gave us reviews especially to Leo Laporte stay in that tub it's a new generation of Leo and I think that he's got the first taste of it it's a Jason Howell with the Dell Venue 8 - Miriam jawar for the Sony Xperia phone - Aaron Newcomb for the Raspberry Pi 2 - you four are before you return product yeah and we'll catch you next time don't forget before you buy has moved to Fridays that's right every Friday supposedly at 2 o'clock you can find us looking at all the latest and the greatest in the consumer world until next time on father Robert

He got a hold of two great hi-res audio players: the Astell&Kern JR, and the Fiio X7. He compared them, and then we had a showdown between the devices based on design & build quality, user interface, and sound quality. Take a listen!

Player|Astell&Kern JR|Fiio X7|NDTV 24x7|Gadget Guru,2020-10-07 10:14:19.928825, so let us go over some of the points that we have been discussing first of all form factor and in this to shoot out between the assailant curve and the fear is not even close this is a fantastic slim beautiful looking form factor this is clunky at the best of times some people complain about the edges in this I think it's okay it's not really going to cut you form factor very clearly this wins when it comes to the user interface and the operating system this uses Android this has its own and again personally I would prefer this to the Android but then maybe that's just me crucial question of course will eventually come down to sound quality how do these sound and how does it compare with what we were just discussing simple music from our iPhone or an iPod and also a new generation of forms that is now available which does come with with these now this for example doesn't have the 3.5 jack is the laical as which has been rumored with the iphone which is going to have people say just a lightning connector this again you can just plug this in like this and hear music directly now how would that compare with one of these two high-resolution tracks but I just put the entire thing to the test starting off and lets us have the same piece of music in all of these these devices so I'm going to hear Coldplay and I'm going to start off with hearing it basically and simply on an iPhone so this is a EC it is what you get on iTunes and let's just hear what it sounds like so here's the thing this is music the way you and I normally listen to it on our devices this is an mp3 it's playing and if you never heard the difference you may not be able to know what you're really missing the minute you shift to high resolution though the difference is immediate it is dark and I can't tell you how good it sounds so you know I have to tell you the minute though you switch to this thing to that same track of music in high resolution the difference is staggering and I know it's a bit unfair if you can't see what I'm talking about but the difference is absolutely massive you'll start hearing details that you didn't know existed you will start hearing little pieces of instrumental music playing down here which you haven't ever heard before it's very quite an experience it's the same difference actually from watching standard-definition on television and watching high definition on television that's the sort of a difference now this is high raise how does this high res compare let's just try and choose between the Asselin Kern and the field so here's the Ashland Kern look personally and sometimes this becomes a matter of personal choice I would prefer the sound than this also to the feel but both sound really good so let's just show you both of these in some details I'll give you my take we feel the best way to conduct a shootout between these two devices would be on the basis of three parameters design and build quality the design on the Asturian current JR is sturdy and sharp quite literally it has edges that dig into your fingers but if you're going to be more of a pocket user that shouldn't be a problem there's a handy volume rocker on the back that can be rotated to control the output volume and I starch speaking of pockets the Pheo x7 is a large and bulky device it feels as sturdy as the a and KJR but it's certainly a handful when it comes supportability however a beautiful blue light that the device emits from the button does make it look oh so appealing user interface a sterling con have fitted their very own interface on the jr. we feel that while the interface is simple and has all the right functions in all the right places it's not the quickest of the lot the touch scroll is quite slow to respond and we wish there were a better way to implement it the Pheo x7 on the other hand runs on Android the OS has two modes pure music mode and Android mode the first one allows for more music Center device performance while the latter allows you to use apps like Google Chrome or use a file manager to browse through your files at length sound quality now when it comes to judging something as subjective as sound quality we believe it's all about the personal experience but we all know which one is Vikram's favorite so here would be my take when it comes to sound quality both of them are really very good you won't go wrong with either of them but given that this is more expensive than the acident kernels and given that a form factor of this is so much superior if I had to choose I would pick this over this but you should hear it for yourself to see whether the sound is preferred one way or the other by you if you want standalone high resolution music players then of course and if you've got the money is about

dialogue the dialogue on analog music reproduction in this episode we're gonna discover one of my favorite digital formats oh yeah I know this is an analog channel but every once in a while I add a little touch of digital ready let's take a look okay guys so today we're gonna talk of one of my favorite digital mediums in my most humble opinion this is the pinnacle of digital audio reproduction and it's something rather old actually what am I talking about DVD audio perhaps you've heard about it maybe someone didn't it's something that as I said if it's old this was mainly developed around the first years of the 2000s so mainly 2000 2001 2002 and then it slowly went down what happened well actually during the end of the 90s a lot of people felt that the CDs were not giving a high quality standard a lot of people are disappointed it was time also to move on the the format was already old in the 90s and different solutions were starting to emerge and there was a huge battle at a certain point between DVD audio and the other huge format that Sony presented super audio CD which actually is transformed but it's still present today in fact we're gonna do a video on it because super audio CD is DSD audio but we'll get back to that today we're gonna discuss about the other format if we have to declare a winner between between the two we can't we can just say that we have a larger production of super audio cities than DVD audios so maybe it's a slight winner but we don't care about that we care about the quality about these discs this was my first Gerry Rafferty can I have my money back which also has two albums I thinks or a series of other songs on it because as you can imagine these are DVDs but not readable you could not insert these in a normal CD player and that was already a huge problem in terms of competitive compatibility well the industry thought that since DVD was become becoming big and it was in that in that period and for a few other years after that might as well try to insert the possibility of having high-quality audio through that through the player through the the DVD player which unfortunately people did not want to do we discovered afterwards the same work is going to be done also for blu-ray players since we have blu-ray pure audio etc even that did not reach enough popularity to be adopted by the different labels and be assessed itself unfortunately because today obvious we all know liquid music is is paramount but as you also know we're going back to the vinyl to physical formats but that's another section if we're talking about digital today we only have streaming or HD tracks high-resolution in that form and we are gonna go more in depth than that as well but I again I want to focus on DVD audio because there's one special element about these special discs as you can see there they have this very strange format this jewel case which is a almost square all the discography for example of Steely Dan if you don't know Steely Dan you have to know Steely Dan they they were one of the first to go full in all the way in to do all their albums in dvd-audio and the quality of these as I was saying is amazing why is this because I think this is my opinion when it was a magical moment when the producers the labels decided to transfer mein albums famous albums as you can see adjust a few albums are were currently released in that precise moment there are mainly reissues and they did I think almost flat transfers I mean there's no equalization or at least very slight the transfers are very high-quality the conversions I have no idea why they're exceptional these recordings here these digital versions are truly amazing trust me guys III know I mean if you get a super audio CD for me it does not reach this type of quality this one for example Alice and Tom Jobim it's amazing it's it's it's incredible I also have the original LP of this which costs a lot of euros this compared to that LP is better don't kill me it's better I mean the dynamic range lightly captured directly from the master tapes because all these were obtained directly from the master tapes is incredible in fact they still go for high prices on ebay but that's practically discogs and ebay are all the only places where you're gonna still find these and again the sound is amazing you have to look though try if you want to try experiment some of these you have to look for those containing high linear PCM audio if you're interested in 5.1 surround okay because that's also in here as you can imagine that these was one of the first formats to have multi-channel 5.1 etc even quad they tried different kinds of things and unfortunately what is the problem here that a lot of people were focusing mainly on DTS Dolby Digital surround no guys we want linear PCM stereo to channel in fact only with stereo linear PCM you can reach the maximum resolution of these which is 192 kilohertz per 24 bits while instead of the other types of surround reach maximum 94 kilohertz per 24 bits so I think you it's worth to take a shot and try these obviously obviously you need a DVD audio not DVD video DVD audio if this is a different logo and capable machine to deal with that and now the pretty rare although I'm sure you can find them on eBay etc for a very low price or high five sharp remember I in that video I discussed all the different resources where to find your online even use at good prices here's a link ok so again there are a lot of blu-ray players today or DVD players they're still out there which are capable of reading the DVD audio codec format because otherwise you can't what happened in a certain point they realized that they were losing a lot of people a lot of customers of clients I mean people were not using these because you need a specific special machine not a normal list in DVD player and that was the downside of all of that in fact very late already in 2005-2006 and said or even later they tried different new solutions like maybe you heard about dual disc we're on one side you had a CD on the other side you had DVD audio just to give the opportunity to listen out also a CD player or things like this which it looks like a normal fantastic John Coltrane album Blue Train this is a special HD ad of this something is already dead where on one side you have one 24 bits 192 kilohertz sampling rate which is for DVD audio and on the other here we broke a taboo which only on one side you can record on digital media here on both sides you have you have audio on the other side we have 24 bits 96 kilohertz because only recently only afterwards they started to put material that is was readable also by normal DVD video machines which can reach 24 bits per 96 kilohertz sampling rate so if you want to go maximum you're gonna need a DVD audio machine if you're if you're in you're good with 96 kilohertz 24 bits you can use your normal blu-ray player or DVD player no problem for example in fact other artists at a certain point that wanted to reach higher quality we all know that Neil Young was really into this and he still is but unfortunately that drifted a little bit away he was really in a high resolution audio he's releasing all his collection all his albums all his recording is in very high resolution he created pono that music player without the high res before anybody else did them that's that's very cool he did this album which I think is very good which came out in the 2005 I think or something like that and he put a normal CD version but he also put a DVD version which is a DVD video and in this case it is a 96 kilohertz sampling rate by 24 bits so and I must admit that the side the difference between the CV and and the other version is incredible it's fantastic it's much much better and when you find versions for example like this one by Steely Dan which is you have the advance resolution stereo 192 24 this is mine boy the quality of digital here finally digital has a purpose I think exceptional dynamic range full frequency response it does have that a little bit of coldness that digital keeps always but we're distant from a normal CD oh boy oh boy this is much much better okay guys one of the downsides of this format is that in order to understand what you're selecting because you can't select the different types of versions the different files you have to have a screen connected you have to turn it on you have to look what you're looking for sometimes it's cool there are other videos pictures going while the music is rolling but I just want to put it in and listen to it and that's also I think it's some reason why people did not buy so many okay I just want to add it one specific aspect which i think is interesting most of the 5.1 tracks on these in some cases also the stereo have a lossless compression MLP which stands for maybe you guessed it meridian lossless packaging yes those who invented mqa his mqa is a lossy although compression by meridian i think that it's something very similar that what they were looking on they were studying me doing research on and there probably is a connection between the two in any case I hope you're gonna try to explore these I think they're fantastic one of the few digital formats that true give me that really give me some vibration some emotions and leave your comments your below let me know what you think about it and apart from this digital stuff guys remember music is born analog bye-bye
158,mOeCt8EL-9E,M. Zillch,UCwtczfxV9HQGDoBtU-jEdVQ,Hi-Res Audio (HRA) Ultrasonic Test Visual Aid v.3.0 (read text below),"I thought it might be useful to some of our AVSforum readers to share with them the same visual aid that some of us already benefit from, namely an ultra high frequency spectrum analyzer, to help hone in on the specific parts of the hi resolution test tracks which might make identifying them easier, so as to then later focus on that specific part of the track, in comparison to the lo-res version.

There are several very important things to know before you use my video as a visual aid:

#1. It is impossible to cheat in an ABX test by using this (particular) analyzer, even if you download it yourself, because the option to use it is blocked during actual foobar ABX testing, so this isn't a ""cheat method"". 

 #2. This is for demonstration and educational use only. Always use proper safety precautions and don't listen to the files at loud levels.

#3 The audio portion of the video is LOW quality and compressed by Youtube, so it is therefore NOT hi-res. To use this video properly you must synchronize its playback to your external hi resolution audio (HRA) playback system. Barring that, you can simply denote the time stamp (displayed on the bottom of the video image itself) to then later focus on that particular song passage after watching the video.

 The video is made of three, hi resolution only tracks, played sequentially. The first and last track are the same: AVSforum member ArnyK's ""keys jangling full band 2496 test tones f3.wav"" [The f3 part denotes it is his newest, third attempt which makes some slight alterations, and fixes some minor bugs.] He provides a download link to both it and a low res version to compare it to, in post#2501 of the thread ""DebateThread: Scott's Hi-res Audio Test"".

 The 2nd high resolution track, sandwiched between identical tracks #1 and #3, is the pristinely recorded song ""Mosaic"", kindly provided by Mark Waldrep, founder and chief engineer of AIX Records. The track selected is the current front runner for ""most favorite"" by people who have submitted their test results to Scott Wilkinson's thread ""AVS/AIX Hi-Resolution Audio Test: Take 2"", where the track is offered for download, in both standard and Hi-Res forms [but with only letter codes so as to not divulge which is which, for testing purposes]. This and his other tracks were selected both for their extended dynamic range and extremely high frequency content, which exceeds the capabilities of the CD format.

 The ""Mosaic"" cut needs no introduction. It is simply one of the best, most finely crafted audio recordings I have ever heard, even through my rather modest audio system. Although both the dynamic range and high frequency extension is clearly apparent, it is done without exaggeration and is completely natural.

 Jangling keys sound, on the other hand, can be a little annoying [even though I'm sure Arny's recording is spot on accurate with his use of high-end, DPA 4006 mics] and are known to have more acoustical power in the ultrasonic range than any conventional musical instrument, so as you'll see the bouncing bar graphs show a very strong signal up there. After 12 seconds of this there is a ""training tone"" at 4 kHz which prompts the listener as to what to listen for should their system be plagued by IM distortion in the next, brief test tone section. Hearing uniform clicks after this tone is expected, however if you hear faint 4kHz tones after this first one, or other noises (besides the clicks common to both the normal and hi-res versions), you unfortunately have an IM problem.

 The last 12 seconds of Arny's track demonstrates what the ultrasonic frequencies sound like when played in isolation from the lower, CD quality only range (which might otherwise mask the ultrasonics). He has kindly filtered away for us the lower frequencies so we might listen to these pure, ultrasonic only sounds as a learning tool.

v.2.0 includes time synch flash indicators for each track with human time reaction correction built-in, or use the video display time code ""0:00"" if you have lightning fast reflexes 

v.3.0 now includes a few, select ultrasonic peak annotations and my attempt to describe the purpose of ArnyK's training tone, including the immediately following (possible) IM distortion generating test tones, indicating an artifact problem with your gear.

like to introduce you to a new product from Onkyo is a portable high resolution music player it song keel DP X 1 so it is the newest portable divisor being made by Onkyo and released to the to market and this product is being introduced the market last year in which 2016 and currently is not really widely available everywhere but you could go online and order it from which what I did is I got it from Amazon and you bought it from Japan into US foot box that will do that please keep in mind the standard shipping from Japan to the US is between 2 to 4 weeks in my case actually it took three weeks to my door so excuse me for the reflection here as the product I'll leave it shiny so I'd like to talk about the package and the design in which this is the box that the device came in with appear to be pretty fancy looking standard box with all the information on that so let's put this on the side and let you into the device itself so it is a pretty slick design portable device is operated based on Android operating units so most of you already familiar with the Android operating unit and it appears to have a really slick design it type up one of the Chi in the market right now so let's take a closer look at the device here so the device I do appear to have aluminum body style with the touchscreen capabilities so let's take a look at the overall looking of the device here hopefully I can zoom it in and get some good angle here so on this side we have a full band for play next previous power along with two slots for memory cards and we will talk about that and later in the videos on top we have two ports that the headphone jack port one is a regular 3.5 millimeter and the other one is a balanced one which is 2.5 millimeter balanced with full post on the other side is the dialing knob for the volume on this version here the volume does have a hundred 60 steps in which is going to allow you to adjust the volume level to your comfortable level and at the bottom here we have charging USB port along with the data port in which if you prefer to use the OTG which is on the go storage you can plug it in here and provide additional storage so this device does have the internal storage which is a 32 gig internal and with two slots that you can put in the micro SD card and it support up to four hundred and thirty two gigabyte among the two so in my case I got two of the 128 gig Michael SD card being installed and it just like any other Android device that is has out the ABS are the interfaces it does have capabilities where you can actually install more apps and use it as you will come with the device is a proprietary app for music playing alone so this is the interface to the app so let me go ahead and talk about the little bit about technical specs so this on GOG px1 does come with dual amps and decks in which is using the Sabri es 9 0 1 8 deck chips and the es every nine six three oh one K amps so it does have dual to em and two decks it provides extremely powerful performance for such a little device here so I'm not going to talk about all the technical specs at those informations can be easily found online so the next step is let me walk you through the music player app along with the navigation so one we launched the app this is going to be the main interface that we're going to have and it's actually it's a really good looking interface it's kind of different from all the other traditional one so on the screen here you can tap anywhere to have displayed or you can tap it to posit to go to the next song you can actually swipe to the right or you can actually click on the arrow button here on the screen and it will do the same and on the upper left corner there is the menu button when we click on this one is actually will show you the playlists of the current playlist that you are playing so if you hit back button down here is going to go back to the interface and we got the EQ here where you can turn it on or turn it off don't let the button right next to it where you can go in and adjust the EQ the way you wanted it to select the album you can actually click back button here and it's going to give you the list of all the folders in one memory card if you like one more time is actually going to show all the storage in which we got the internal storage as the card number one SD card number two and USB storage in which if you use the OTG storage and this is where the music going to be so it has several categories under here with that you can do the folder you swipe it to the left you got a playlist artist album and go on right so let's say if I want to play the music out SD card number one I'm going to select this one it appears to have all the folders if I want to play all songs from all folders I just click on play all here and it will pick up all the songs onto all folders however if I decide to pick a sub bass and then is go into that one folder and we can hit play all here to play that one folder alone so that is how to pick the playlist or the folders of your music additionally you can actually look for song names all these names or what now so the example is here the search button you can click here and I'm going to type in let's say age and it's going to pop up everything with that searching criteria in it including song names the oddest name the album name or what not with that containing that short phrase of searching criteria so once we inside of the plain interface this is where you can actually go to the settings for the app this is the audio setting so there's appear to be multiple functions that you can actually adjust DSP function this is the filter up sampling ma mod or any other setting is all seated in here where you can go in and adjust yourself and you know make it to be the way that optimize your listening experience as your music playing at any even time that you would like to fast forward your music on the screen you can see the highlight area on the circle there you can simply tap and hold on it and move it along to where you want to stop

HiBy are undeniably masters of software! People know that mostly thanks to their HiByMusic app and firmware for Audio players. When we got HiBy R5 digital audio player (DAP) in our hands, the first question that popped up in our heads was: Can HiBy actually make nice audio players? Will 2 analog outputs transmit the best quality sound, what about HiBy R5 screen resolution and chances to outplay iBasso DX150? Find out in our video!

Even their top players look really questionable in reviews their most advanced Bluetooth receiver w5 plays juicy but they paired codec UAT which is ultra audio transmission still refuses to work properly even on medium settings. Among their product line audio player models R3, R6 and R6 Pro escaped from my side but Hiby R5 has been in our hands for a pretty long to create a certain impression. Mine is Bohdan welcome to Tech Fellas so now you'll find out how good or bad that impression is. Before I turn on an audiophile mode just take a look on its body. The player isn't so eye-catching, it's bulky but also compact and incredibly easy to use. All buttons are scattered along the sides and I personally feel tactile pleasure pressing them. There's no volume dial and the power buttons got a damn bright LED that thanks to engineering sanity can be turned off in settings. The body itself is an aluminum frame with glass panels glued on the front and back. Oleophobic coating is only in the front one and it's pretty mediocre. Top and bottom frame inserts are distinctive especially in profile and attractive in their own way. They are made of fairly solid and wear resistant but still plastic and therefore it's only a matter of time when they lose their attractiveness. Although the only digital port here is Type C it helps to manage everything you need which is memory access by USB 2.0 unfortunately, signal output and receiving in USB DAC mode and essentially device charging. In particular the system supports quick charge 3.0. Why there's no charging block at all from the box with audio player for 400 bucks I think on the Apple can answer these after all iPhone 11 supports quick charging but it's charging brick comes in 5 watt. By the way check out this one if you want to see more hidden stuff from Apple iPhone 11 recent presentation. Thank you and have a great day. There are two analog outputs: 3.5 headphone jack that supports playback control via headset button and balance pentagon for those who like thick hips. By the way both can be used like line outputs as well as headphone outputs. I found this quite extraordinary but anyway it's said - it's set. The screen here is 4 inches IPS one with resolution too painful for my reviewer mouth. It's 540 by 1080 for you understanding even iPhone 5 with the same diagonal had more pixels inside. If stop being nasty the screen is actually good enough and isn't too scratchy. Colors are classic for LCD, viewing angles are okay for that class even upon the strong tilt contrasting objects do not lose their details although colors distort a bit. Unfortunately the brightness range is abstract and almost useless here. As for the performance this digital audio player is one of the fastest I've ever used. To be frank I would play games here only for making fun of owners of DX 220 but in general snappy response and smooth work in both player and streaming clients is a big advantage of these DAP because not a lot of players can easily run even such low load tasks. Hiby R5 obtained Bluetooth 4.2 - that works in two ways and by programming means understands almost any modern codec. How strong is its signal I'd define by the worlds ""Fair enough"" because W5 receiver's signal transfer is weaker than expected but still manageable. So to say DX150 doesn't know how to deal with it at all. Wi-Fi in the player comes with 5 gigahertz support but it doesn't bring really worth results. One of the reasons why our DAP is bulky is its battery for 3500 mAh. If you connect your headphones through regular output, it will play music for about 20 hours. In case of the balanced one 12 hours is players maximum. At least with my earphones with 20 ohm impedance. When it's in standby mode the battery will discharge by 5 percent in a day. Getting closer to the sound the main engine here is dual Cirrus logic CS 43 198 with two crystal oscillators low-pass filter OPA 1612 and an amplifier DP 8397. For you to know such DAC you can see Norma SR 15 and upcoming ibasso DX160. And now start in the audiophile madness - the sound from this DAP is sassy pleasurable and fairly not dull at all. Hiby R5 will bring any recording with flows to the maximum stage of comfort and delicacy almost without the influence of headphones. Such effect is brought by wise treating of high frequencies not killing them but noticeably clamping. This makes the sound a bit darker so for example jazz gets somewhat constrained flavor. What surprises me the most is that hardly noticeable cymbals on the background don't become a noise and I can even hear them somehow. Considering that explicit sounds are frankly crushed in amplitude and what used to bite our ears doesn't do that anymore, that makes me think that not everything is so simple in R5 tuning. The same thing applies to overtones if the highs were roughly cut the players sound would be artificial muddy and too defective by the way how it's realized here is some kind of a magic. Mids are emotional expressive and not waxed, if I had to talk with allegories imagine a big flashy Hedgehog it's like a hedgehog but not prickly a big one but it won't hurt you by any means. There are no issues the reflection of the contrast between sounds of different volume but the soundstage I wish would be better. After all hiby R5 it's not so analytical and subtle source so why is there need to limit yourself in soundstage. I cannot call mids very crisp and sharp. They're mostly fluid and musical. You will clearly feel how massive become acoustic instruments and male vocals. Literally after 10 minutes of listening you stop caring about that slight lack of air and begin enjoy the sound from R5 kinda like from the expressed taste of matured whiskey. With all the picture bass here is certainly not dry it's raised slightly crawling into the middle that makes drumming shock really noticeable even at not high-volume. The texture of lows and deep bass are not easily reproduced by a player but they could the feeling that no one was going to focus on them. Well engineers see better! The main goal of local bass is to add some Drive and make you dance in a music with the most delicious sound. Like any player with its own character hiby R5 has its own preferences. Such styles like instrumental jazz soul and close to them I would prefer to listen on something else. Absence of blooming and sparkling treble might ruin the whole picture for you, however electronic, pop, not very fast metal and rock these are the main bros of the hero of our review. The choice of headphones is as simple as possible - R5 will gladly work with everything that the same person will plug to DAP. The fact is when connected by the pentacon with the standard load of 35 ohms the maximum power per channel is just some kind of miserable 564 milli watt. At the same time there's very low background noise and an insanely quiet click on the relay that you can slightly hear every time pressing the pause. As for the firmware it's Android with almost perfectly working and so familiar to us Hiby music app and Play Store with Google services. The system is frankly naked you won't find what you won't need but some necessary things have been added like bypassing the sample rate converter that prevents the Android beast from spoiling the sound. The system is well set I didn't notice any glitches and crashes during the usage. Summarizing the stuff hiby R5 is one of the finest audio players that I had a chance to try out, it's pleasing by many reasons ergonomics comfort hold stable work response and most importantly the sound Some better players will have significantly higher costs. For instance DX150 will cost you 150 bucks more when SR15 will ask you twice as much as price of Hiby R5. I'm personally waiting for DX160 and what do you think which device will beat Hiby R5 and if you like this video then why not to support our channel by subscribing to it hitting the like button a ringing the bell to stay tuned for more cool content.

The A&K 380 series was called “the evolution of a masterpiece” so AK’s marketing division decided to make the switch to A&Ultima for the AK380’s successor. The most important to keep in mind is that the new SP1000 will replace the AK380 as their flagship, the AK380 itself will be phased out. The SP1000 was redisigned from top to bottom.

The A&Ultima SP1000 is the first Astell&Kern player to feature an octa-core CPU for outstanding response and performance. I played with the DAP in Munich and it is incredibly fast to work with. AK also added a few new sliding options with shortcuts which are very handy. The new screen – a High Definition HD5 display – is larger than the one on the AK380 and the volume wheel now is a multi-function Wheel. The gorgeous SP1000 comes in a stainless steel or copper housing.

The audio player is available now through Sony's extensive distribution network, and is available in five colour options, namely Black, Blue, Pink, Red, and Yellow.

The Sony NW-A25 has an internal storage capacity of 16GB (expandable via microSD card - up to 128GB) and supports high-resolution audio formats of up to 24-bit/192kHz resolution. Formats supported by the player include mp3, wav, aiff, wma, aac, he-aac, flac, and Apple Lossless. The device also has a 2.2-inch TFT-LED screen that serves visual cues for the device, as well as FM radio capability.

The player is USB 2.0 compliant for charging and data transfers, and is also Bluetooth 3.0 compatible with A2DP and LDAC compliance for use with wireless headsets. It does not come with bundled headphones, but allows for a frequency response ranging from 20-40,000Hz when used with separate headphones. The device also features certain upscaling and encoding technologies meant to improve sound quality, such as DSEE-HX and ClearAudio+, which work with the NW-A25's S-Master HX digital amplifier.

It notably also has a digital noise cancelling system, supporting certain environments such as buses, trains, airplanes and offices. This is a useful addition, as the device can be used to turn ordinary headphones into noise-cancelling ones, and will represent serious value to potential buyers. The Sony NW-A25 has a claimed battery life of up to 30 hours when used with high-resolution audio formats and up to 50 hours when listening to compressed audio formats. It can also be used to view images and play back videos.

With the launch of the NW-A25 in India, Sony is on a high-resolution spree, having also recently launched the SRS-X99 high-end speaker for Rs. 49,990.

everyone lands here and welcome to my review today of the mega mini by hi-fi man this is a mid-level player that's a great example for proving that you don't have to spend a lot of money to get a high quality digital player however because this player takes more of a no-frills approach it's not going to appeal to everyone especially those who prefer more features over better quality performance so in this review I'll not only talk about the strengths of the mega money but also describe situations where a different player might be a better choice now currently this player costs about $250 but I'll include links in the description where you can check the current lowest price as well as any additional information so included with the mega mini is a charging and syncing cable and some basic documentation now regarding the design this is one of the best aspects of this player and although it's not necessarily a head-turner it's still sharp looking and the functional elements are what make it fantastic to use on the front there are four easy to press buttons which allow you to navigate through your music and the different menu options then on the left side of the player there are two volume buttons for turning the volume up or down on the right side you have your on or off button and then towards the bottom of the player there's a headphone jack a micro SD card slot and a micro USB slot for charging and syncing the device the entire body is made from aluminium and includes a robust finish that makes it feel more expensive than it really is on the top half of the player there's the display which is great for what it's for everything is certainly sharp enough and it allows you to read the display even in full daylight then moving on to the features the mega mini doesn't have any onboard memory but it does have a micro SD card slot which can support up to 256 gigabytes total the operating system is very solid and provides a simple and intuitive user experience however I notice the performance is affected by how much battery life is left meaning as you get towards the end of your battery life menu speeds and responsiveness are a little bit slower but aside from that the interface is well laid out and you can figure everything out without needing to reach for a manual now an important feature for a high-res music player is the ability to play any file format and in this regard the mega mini truly shines this is a major convenience as you don't have to worry about converting a bunch of music files to use this and you can use the mega mini just as easily for lower res mp3 files as you can for your higher quality music now getting to the sound quality the mega mini gives you a taste of what you can expect from higher end music players without the high end price tag overall the sound can best be categorized as clean and open it's not cold or sterile yet it offers incredible precision that makes all music genres sound great so starting with the low end for anyone who enjoys a super clean bass the mega mini will be a real treat to your ears because you get an extremely clean presentation that's almost unheard of at this price point even when listening to bass heavy tracks there's no audible distortion or muddiness and when paired with very revealing headphones everything sounds clean and coherent for example the electronic version of Canon and D minor by Josh Viet II is filled with tons of fast bass that can often sound blurred on lower quality players but with the mega mini even fast base hits cleanly and doesn't leave any excess base behind and then it's controlled bass also translates well into more subdued genres like classical and folk so when you're listening to a heavier classical track like the moonlight sonata the piano notes slam down with a real fluid Authority now conversely listening to the same piece of music on a player that doesn't handle the bass quite as well and the notes end up sounding more we core unconvincing but again here with the mega mini they sound more euphonic or pleasing to the ear and as a result you just get more of a sense that the music is coming from a real piano rather than some cheap electronic keyboard now it's important to emphasize that even though the bass here is very well executed it's still well controlled which means this probably won't satisfy anyone who's after more ear thumping type bass and because the presentation is more focused on being accurate clean and fast these characteristics mean it may feel a bit lacking for anyone who prefers a larger body or longer decay to their base but overall the mega mini really hits the sweet spot as far as bass goes because there's neither too little or too much and what you get is of such high quality then moving on to the mids you get more of that clean and fast sound that you hear in the bass on the lower mids the authority of the bass makes things like cellos and male vocals sound more dominant but as you move towards the upper mids female vocals also sound clean and coherent for example when you're listening to my heart will go on Celine's boys sounds like it's soaring because the way her voice is presented she just sounds so clean and effortless so for anyone who really likes the mids the mega-money won't disappoint as you're getting both a clean and substantial mid-range and then finally we get to the treble and this could be the area where people have some trouble when it comes to audio because to some people elevated treble sounds pristine while the others it can sound discomforting the good thing here is that the treble on the mega mini is neither of those things like both the bass and the mids the treble maintains a very balanced sound and approach however if you're using more detailed headphones there is a slight shift towards the treble being a little bit snappier than what would be considered perfectly flat but this slightly elevated treble doesn't distract from the listening experience instead it adds a little bit of extra sparkle to the music that makes some songs in particular sound even better like when you're listening to within from Daft Punk it sounds especially brilliant on the mega mini as the sparkle and cymbal crash at the beginning of the track sounds as clear as can be yet the extra Sparkle never sounds overly fatiguing either so as a result you can expect to discover new sounds in your music with this player yet at the same time it's not going to cause any lower quality music files you have to sound awful a good example of this is when listening to something like good riddance by Green Day because even though this is a lower quality track the song still sounds good and not as if it's being taken apart and because the mega mini is able to strike such a perfect balance between detail and smoothness the result is that both audio files and the more casual music listeners will be able to really enjoy this player now soundstage isn't something that necessarily comes up as much when you're talking about music players but in the right situation the mega mini definitely stands out so keep in mind this will be affected by the headphones you're using and the type of music you're listening to for example with some normal clothes back headphones and listening to something like contemporary music you're not going to notice much of a difference if at all but with some open headphones and listening to something like Rondo alla turca by Mozart and it becomes very noticeable you get even more of a sense of being in the middle of a large Orchestra and it's truly surreal how good the sound stage is here again typically portable sources tend to sound more closed in but that's certainly not the case with this player so even though the mega mini really shines considering the level of sonic performance it provides it still won't be the perfect choice for everyone for example if you're someone who relies on or likes to have more features to work with such as an EQ then this may not be the player for you as its priority is to give you better performance over more features and along these lines if you want Bluetooth capability or to be able to connect to a streaming music service such as Spotify then the mega-money won't be a good choice for that as well but otherwise what the mega mini does excel at is delivering a high level of sonic performance in a no frills package I like that it's simple and intuitive to use and that it appeals to both the casual music listener as well as the audiophile so whether you consider yourself a serious audio enthusiast or if you just want to start experiencing what high-end audio is all about the - mega mini would be an excellent choice so hopefully this review was helpful for you if so leave a thumbs up I always appreciate that and remember to check below in the description and include any additional information especially where you can get this app for the best price but otherwise thanks so much for your time I really appreciate you guys watching and hopefully I'll see in another video
171,DCXWx4lYHbQ,TodayIFeelLike,UC9cTxESo7MiM0Zg2lIQiEjg,Fiio M6 High Resolution Music Player With Touchscreen Bluetooth And Airplay,"Good: The Fiio M6 has both built-in storage and a Micro SD card slot so you can expand the 2GB of internal storage with Micro SD cards up to 2TB for loads of music, podcast and audiobooks on your M6.
Good: The M6 allows you to use wired headphones for the highest quality audio but you can also use high resolution Bluetooth for great sounding convenient wireless listening. This is one of the reasons why as a photographer I love this music player when I'm out shooting. I can connect my Bluetooth headphones and listen without having an audio cable getting tangled with my camera strap or snagged on my gear. Also as a photographer I often connect my camera to my phone to control the camera, or transfer images and video via the camera's app and when I do that my music playback is interrupt on the phone. However, when using the Fiio M6 I don't have to worry about that I am free to use my phone as I please and still enjoy my music.
Good: The size and shape of this device makes it a very pocket friendly device. The M6 is small and thin and it has nice rounded corners that make it comfortable to slip into and carry in your pocket. Devices with sharp edges have a tendency to poke you and become uncomfortable in your pocket after a period of time.
Good: The Fiio M6 runs a customized version of Android so not only can you have files from your own personal music library but you can also load apps from music services like Spotify and Amazon Music and play songs from those services over wifi or offline.
I have seen some other reviews were people have complained about battery life or playback controls with the buttons but as someone who uses this devices for 2-4 hours at a time I have never once ran out of juice while listening. However, because the M6 does run Android you have to remember to turn off the device when you are not using it or the battery will slowly drain just like a cellphone or tablet does when in standby mode. Also, as someone who is used to using a smartphone I find the controls very similar to iPhones and Samsung devices so the M6 is a comfortable and familiar device to use. So bottomline if you love high quality music playback, or if you are a photographer like me and you want a separate music player from your phone for either quality or convenience then the Fiio M6 is a great device. The M6 gives you high quality playback both wired and wirelessly and it allows you to access your music the way you want to.       
Bad: The Fiio M6 runs a customized version of Android which means you can sideload some apps that are whitelisted by Fiio like Amazon Music and Spotify but you can't install other types of player apps that I really love like Audible or VLC. The player will play audiobooks but you have to either download them in or convert them to MP3s or other compatible formats. 
Bad: I have yet to get the M6 to work with my Macbook Pro. This isn't a big problem for me because I store all of my music on a Micro SD card anyway.

10:14:19.929222, hey everyone this is Larry welcome back to today I feel like calm today we're gonna take a look at the file m6 high-resolution music player this is a seriously high-resolution dap with bluetooth let's go check it out alright let's go ahead and jump right into the good and the bad of this device and the first good thing up that i want to mention is that this device the file m6 has both internal storage and it has a micro SD card slot so you get two gigs of built-in storage that you can put your music on there or if you want to put it in expanded music library on your device you can actually use a SD card a micro SD card to load your music in audiobooks and podcasts on there that way you can listen to all the stuff that you want and have all of your music that you want to take with you on the go on that SD card and they both work really nicely together alright so the next good thing that i want to mention about this device the file m6 music player is that it allows you to get the highest resolution playback using wired headphones but you can also get high resolution playback over bluetooth now this is really important to me as a photographer because when i go out shooting the last thing that i want is to have a pair of headphones wrapped all up and tangled in with my camera strap i can't tell you how many times i've been out and shooting and my camera strap gets tangled up with my headphones cable i end up having to take off my headphones and my camera and untangle all of it it really just becomes a mess so with the file m6 being wireless for having bluetooth i can use wireless headphones i don't have to worry about any of those cables getting in the way it's just very convenient and very very comfortable to use so another nice thing about the m6 music player is the size and shape of it now it's nice and small it's thin but i really like that it has rounded edges which really makes it nice and easy to pocket this little music player so devices that have sharp and you know just sharp corners they have a tendency to poke you when you put them in your pocket they sort of poke your legs and after a while they become not comfortable to have in your pocket you don't have that problem with devices that have rounded edges and the file m6 has nice rounded edges and it's small and light which makes it comfortable to keep in your pocket and carry with you on the go so the last good thing that I want to mention about this file m6 music player is that it runs a customized version of Android now this is really nice because you can actually add apps that are white listed by the company for this device so you can use apps like title and Spotify and Amazon music and deezer and a number of different apps that you can put on here and then you can listen to your music from those apps so it really is nice and it can be a way to use different music services with the with the file m6 alright so I've been using the file m6 for a while now so let's talk about some of the issues that I've run into it during that time and the first one is that it runs customized Android now customized Android is both a good and a bad thing on the bad side for me is that you can only side load those whitelisted apps that are allowed by file now this was a problem for me because I love to listen to audiobooks and unfortunately you cannot side load audible now I really wish they would whitelist that out because audible is probably the best audiobook app out there and it doesn't work on this device I would really love to listen to them instead what I'm forced to do is to download my ebooks run it through a app that allows me to convert the audible files with mp3 and then I have to then put the mp3 files on my my microSD card and I can listen to them that way so I can get it done but it would be much easier and much nicer if I was able to just install the app on my device now this next bad point about the m6 is I have yet been able to get this thing to work with my MacBook Pro I have a 2018 MacBook Pro and I've installed all the software like you're supposed to except I still cannot get this thing to work right now when I plug it in my computer actually sees it however I cannot drag and drop in it and access the memory of the device the internal memory of the device now this isn't the biggest problem for me because normally I use a micro SD card anyways because I want the expanded storage space so it's not a big deal but I would actually like to be able to use the internal memory if I need to and I haven't been able to access it yet while getting ready to film this review I watched a couple of other people's reviews just to see what other folks had to say about this device and one of the things that they complained about was a battery life now I do have to say that for me the battery life isn't really a problem some people complain saying they only got about two days with the battery life out of it now this does run on Android so you do have to be mindful to turn the device off when you're done using it because just like a cell phone or a tablet it will drain your battery while in standby however I found that you know I use this device usually about two to four hours at a time I usually take it out when I'm shooting and so for me it's not a big problem I take it out I shoot with it when I come back home I just throw it on the charger for a few minutes and get it back to 100% and I'm ready to go so now if you're gonna use this for extended periods of time you want to be mindful that when you're not using it if you turn the device off so that you don't drain the battery now some other people mention that they had issues with the handling of the device where they didn't feel there was enough buttons but for me I actually felt this device was very very easy to use and very familiar because it does run on a customized version of Android it has a touchscreen it looks very similar to using a smartphone and so if you've ever used an iPhone or a samsung phone or any sort of Android device then this is going to look very very familiar and be very comfortable and easy for you to use alright everyone so there we have it that is a look at the bio m6 and bottom line this is a fantastic music player it sounds great it's small and pocketable it really is a fantastic device it has bluetooth and I'd like to use my Bower and Wilkins p7 headphones I have a lot of great headphones these are my current favorites as far as over the ear headphones and these have never sounded better than when using this little device now I've used these with my tablets with my computer's with my cell phones all kinds of stuff this little thing really pushes these to deliver the best performance that they can now I hope you guys enjoyed this video I'm gonna leave a link to this product in the video description so that you guys can check it out on your own and get more information or pick one up if you like it and again I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please give it a big thumbs up and please subscribe to my channel and follow me on Facebook and I am Larry but today I feel like calm thanks for coming back to see me come back and see me soon and until next time love peace and hair grease

https://www.amazon.com/OPUS-Premium-Portable-Mastering-Quality/dp/B01M03NULV/ref=sr_1_4?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1483009096&sr=1-4&keywords=opus+audio+player",28,8324,30.0,55.0,8.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oOhmgzG6_F4/hqdefault.jpg,OPUS Audio|DAP|audio review,2020-10-07 10:14:19.929270," it was at this moment Jackson knew he  up okay this is uh this is a review for the opus audio number one this is a rare version this is the CNC I think that's what they say aluminum chassis ones the regular opus one was mostly released in ABS plastic and this is an aluminum frame it's stout it's nice it's it's beautiful it's absolutely beautiful I just checked Amazon and Opus one original version is going for about four hundred dollars which is this deal this one is still going for $8.99 which is double that price and then they've got the new one which is going for fifteen in Japan this one was on a earphones and it was touted as a limited only fifty available in Japan and it was the equivalent of 1,500 last week so these are not common the one that I've got right here and op amps in it are different so the advertising campaign for this item was aluminum chassis with improved op amps that's that's their sales pitch and you know do often make a difference well you can switch them out of things and yeah they do so this would probably be slightly different sonically from the more well-known opus number one it's it's beautiful it's absolutely beautiful the high res audio is etched into the aluminum this isn't like a stick or like painted on it's it's it's laser etched in as you turn it on this side it's got Nick's previous play/pause I'm pretty sure turn it and on the top you've got the power button you've got balanced out 2.5 and then you've got 3.5 regular headphone out on the opposite side you've got a plus/minus for the volume you've got a storage section for your whether you call it MSD or TFT whatever and then you've got USB for data transfer and charging and then we'll rotate this back around to its sexy side it looks sexy everywhere but this this is really really a beautiful beautiful item I'll be honest with you I'm not a fan of the that number two because of the the way that they've got the trim around the edge and also you can see the screws and that's a personal thing I'm gonna I'm about to get into that in a second you lift it up and in and on the back would like a lot of high index it's pretty much like glass on the back this thing is a super print magnet and there's a case that comes with it with some waving back here you've you really got to use it it's not even an option which is a shame because you you don't get to look at this beautiful this it's it's like art I'm gonna get out of super zoom in and talk about the item okay so this is the audio piece number one it's the metal version I already showed that in another part of the video it's got the power button on the top push the power button and I've got let's up on three playing right now or I'm on Led Zeppelin three this is an Android based device so if I swipe down I got line out balanced out EQ sleep repeat or shuffle if I tap the Settings icon I come into screen audio output timer USB language input date/time storage initialize update and information type information and I got model one and this is build 2.0 0.03 this is was released I believe like around the 9th of December so they've been pretty reasonable when it comes to updating the firmware and if you get this as you can see I'm going through pretty quickly the problem is devices even though I'm holding it my hand and it looks fine I can see through this camera lens that it's not looking great the quality of the screen is not great however when it's in your hand and you're using it you don't seem to notice that at all in fact I was kind of surprised that this looked as good as it did because the people that take pictures ever run into the same problem and that is it it looks like it's got a really bad screen not bad but compared that everybody's got phones now with a very high quality screen so when you compare it to that it doesn't it doesn't fare very well you know why talk about a screen so much because it's the interface with the device and it's also a touchscreen it does have physical buttons on it by just the volume and I got that line it kind of goes up and then it's got the next track I guess which would be I think that's what it does is check I'm on immigrant song and that's off to Roy Harper Braun you our stomp this is an awesome album to test stuff out on because it was like I think LEDs up a really peaking right here they all got together at a place in France and just jammed out there's a lot of stories on the net about the making of bullets up and three and I know all about it like I do about Pink Floyd the sound of this device is absolutely fantastic and there's a kind of a problem that I'm running into right now and that is because the company itself and see those finger marks on it I basically touched it twice and I'm not going to put a screen on it because if I do then you know it'll be not look great on a video after this I will put a screen on it but I won't now so you're gonna see fingerprints which is driving me mental crazy but it can't be helped the op-amps of this device are not the same as the plastic version which puts me you op-amps make a difference man there's a thread on hit by belief for people that roll off amps and there's there's there's people who use sound cards there's people who use amps and portable and also home and they use the particular one that they use because they can switch the op amps and because they believe that they have sonic properties that are unique to each one which would be more likely than cables making difference and all my cave is a custom but I do it because I like the quality of the look and it won't be the weak link in the chain having a you know mass-produced cable that came stock isn't gonna interfere with my audio choice so if I get something custom-made I'm chances that it was done better at higher so I paid for that doesn't make a sonic difference I don't you know I don't know I've seen Brooke Lowe's graph and he did some multiple cables and it looks like the only difference is the volume the frequency response is absolutely identical but it looks like some of turning the gain and the whole frequency response just moves up a little or moves down a little boat like the impedances difference or something I'm not sure so do op amps make a difference entire communities are built around the fact that they think it does and if this contains op amps that are not the same as the original Opus one and the advertising from opus that claims that it has better sound because of the different op amps then it's a different device slightly than the regular Opus one so comparing it or including it is it's a little bit of an oddity here it's not like a they gave it another number so that you could have another tag on head fine you could forgive it its own one review another people because so do I put it in there because I don't think it's the same sound as the other ones and it's claimed by the company not to be such so it's not a opinion it's what the company says in their advertisements and I they seem legit with what they say I am a phone based with an external damp person you know I got pH a three is my main unit I've got opus number eleven has my ultraportable I've been through the Mojo I've been through just most everything that's on the market right now I had got not even to mention that company I had something in recently to have just about bass and treble and I stick with that because the quality of the screen is huge the quality of the screen is fantastic the speed that's two gigs around to have us just one dab to have one portable thing that doesn't need anything else because I just I really can only put one thing in my pocket I chose this one I chose it for a few different reasons one is its uniqueness two is because I actually had a chance to hear it and compare with some things and people were alluding to its you know ability to retrieve detail and present a stage that was huge on par with top of the line items and you know what is hype and what is real is very hard to to get it turned out that it was like the Mojo was mostly real and hype is just like the additional frosting on the cake this is a really impressive item the EQ let's see if I can get in there got a heat the fact that that screen has fingerprints but there's nothing I can do about it if I go into this and I go into audio and then I go into equalizer and I pick this one when it could be presented with something like this which is 10 bands 31.5 up to 16 and if I touch it I can increase it it's pretty neat actually I like the one actually turn it off and then turn it back on because the startup screen is pretty cool and then I don't know if any of this is gonna be caught on video because the last time I did a video with this it didn't even show the startup screen so let's see if this does it now I used to do theme mods with the x5 and this is not the same structure because the length of the startup and the quality of it is on a higher level than the the structure up like the x5 or the sound of where esters are I know how those are built those are basically images and like gifts pretty much and it starts up like this talking about the treble in the bass and the mids of a device is it's difficult Dax are not supposed to have too much of a influence however they do sound different I think that the es sounds different and I'm not getting rid of my PHA 3 this has fantastic detail retrieval this is notably superior to the i5 which I had in its you know the speed of its navigation for me to be able to go and do stuff is much easier and faster than it was and it's slightly bigger font and then it was with the i5 bike and though they were a fantastic company to deal with the device itself was not as impressive as this one the stage is what really gets me with this thing this has this this makes everything sound like it has a huge stage these are the ex8 hundreds on there taped which is to enhance the sub-base graphs have shown that the the mids and treble are absolutely not affected by the vent covering it creates driver flex which is not good for drivers so I'm talking to somebody on YouTube right now saying you know my set is not not damaged but the driver flex by modification is clearly not a good idea I'm also using the ex1000 balance thank you to Lee at the Metro electronics for the cable so that I could experience balance which sounds spectacular songs that I listen to typically like Pink Floyd on the run I did a I did a video before and I talked about how there's an audio with a woman who's talking about have you touched the screen you'll get so it's a flack pathname composed of genre go back Zeppelin Floyd that's not the crap okay dark side of Moon on the run okay there's a part in this song that I use and it's the woman who's announcing the arrival and departures and it is a sonic rally coal and I've had people say I'm gonna go check that out and they never came back and said anything because it is a you can kill hear what she's saying or you can't and and that exists in the late base all the way to the early trouble it's a woman's voice and it's over PA so it's occupying a pretty broad band of frequencies and you can catch little bits of it you can catch you know about the beginning half and then the last half you can't catch anything up at all or you can catch all of it and that's got a lot to do with the drivers but it's also got to do with because I used I always use the same when I'm you know checking devices because these are with the sound influence really really is enforced the final stage when it hits the driver and again goes to your ear whatever these are doing is really going to color whatever this does so you got to always use the same drivers when you're comparing stuff and I'm sure people do but I'm doing that so when I listen to this and balance I listen to this tape I've listened to the other stuff also I listen to the K&amp;I v I listen to the file you know x2 or what what that one that I had recently the pH a3 the Mojo and listen to that woman in on the run make her you know boarding pass for key announcements and noted the difference in that and the how much I could hear I can hear it very well on this device it's it's not base light it's not it's not trouble enhance it sounds mid it sounds mid forward slightly and I was listening to a Led Zeppelin three song and that's the way and there's two versions one is called the rough cut and one's called and for the beginning I was thinking this is sounds way in my face and then the next thing was see if I can get in there and then the next thing was that's up in three so I was not aware at the time so it says right here rough mix I didn't know that at the time and I was saying what is that and then I boom everything was smoothed out the original real version of that's the way but the referes and it's the it sounded rough this this is fantastic with detail is this worth the asking price now remember this is double almost what the plastic one is because it's uncommon the plastic one is being bundled with lots of items and totaling four no I don't I don't think you would want to pay double just to get metal in different op-amps I would myself I would pay double for that because I don't want to have the same thing everybody else has and if somebody says also I wanted metal and if somebody says you know the sound has been approved because we use op amps and I have friends that are in you know base and they use tube amps and they use other amps and they say you know I like this one because I switch out the op amps and I've become accustomed to believing that that's probably got some sonic effect so they say that this one's better than the other one then I want to buy that one so but the problem that I'm falling into is here is if you wanting to buy the plastic one the original Opus one and you listen to what I say about the stage and the detail retrieval am I talking about the same device that you're looking to buy I don't know according to the company maybe not so what the hell is the value of this this video you know what I'm saying if you're thinking that so my is I'm doing this right now I'm thinking myself who is this for I guess this would be for the people that are interested in the metal one if you want to buy the metal one I can tell you that it sounds fantastic the screen is better in hand than it is in video or on picture and other items are priced around the same or more and I don't note any difference or improvement Sonic wise this is really beyond this we're getting into kind of placebo and enjoy your hobby level stuff I wouldn't I wouldn't claim you know a Kay's got this velvet thing that they say is in their thing I I think that's that's like pretty close to a DSP if not and I also never hear it when I listen to a Kaede apps and it's not because they're expensive because people they couldn't make that device if people didn't pay for it because that's that's the way the consumer market works so I'm not going to complain because 8k has expensive stuff people pay for it so hey make it but the velvet thing that they said that they've got that enhances the sound quality I've never heard that I don't I don't buy that I think that's a sales pitch would I pick this over an a K you damn right I would I did actually I paid for this I didn't pay the regular price and I got a deal but I paid hundreds of dollars so I didn't get the deal that you might think I did and I could I could undo that if I wanted to but I wouldn't because it's fantastic it's really nice it's absolutely beautiful I wish it was not such a print magnet but you know oh well so the opus number one metal you know militia version or whatever it's called is absolutely outstanding it's a beautiful piece of art I wish I could look at it and take the cover off but then everything would be covered with prints if you put that laminated thing on top and you got it in hand then the prints will be much less prominent but I wanted to do a video without you know having another layer between the screen and the lens so I opted not to use that so when you see the prints we usually don't in my videos or you do when I freak because I can't stand them and I highlight them I'm like a look at that's crap but the devices screen is understate it it's actually quite fine the the stripped-down Android UI is very nice and the sound quality is just absolutely spectacular it's very very nice it is the one gap that I will own no I'm sorry that's a lie I'm gonna keep the column because I use that from my base bomber but as far as I kept or table I want to listen to a good I'm gonna take a trip I want to bring a good player and I don't want to you know pay attention to you know weight or something cumbersome and this is my device I'm the owner of an opus number one metal version and I'm quite happy about that awesome awesome device I like it a lot do I rec it in this price range I don't wreck things I just say if I like it or not and I like it ASG 2.5 s were they worth the money which would be the same as this roughly no way is this worth it yes it is yep like it and that's the video the video that really didn't do anything because I got to the end and I'm saying this probably sounds different than the ABS plastic one because the company claims it does so who is this video for I guess it's for the people that are looking to buy the metal one and want to know is that better than the plastic one I can't honestly say I think it is but that could be placebo because the one is quite impressive and for the price that they're asking now which is like $400 $4.99 that's absolutely a steal that's that's that's very very very good price for a very very good item it was this worth paying a lot more money just because it's got metal and different op-amps I don't know I didn't listen to the two of them that much to make a comparison I just don't I like metal better and it looks like art when it's in your hand and it sounds like Gartland it's in your ear so I dig it do I wreck it if you got the money no I'm saying you gotta pay to play that's way it goes good stuff like it Happy New Year stuff okay we're out of soup ISM this comes with a case I'm pretty sure I don't know anybody that doesn't have a case I think they always kind of package it with kind of like a deal or something and without getting fingerprints on and stuff the case is very very very snug once it's inside here it's really hard to take out so I think I would have liked a black case but this is cool so that is the case and that's how it looks the case I think it looks better without a case but I'd highly recommend who am I to you know reckless to anybody and I'm not anybody direct anything of this price level or anything to anybody and either as anybody else but let me give you a little for those of you who you know think you know who these people that we don't have degrees we're not a you know acoustic scientists we who are we let me show you who I am I won't interrupt this video I do this every year at Christmastime so we're about to get into shaky stuff so bear with me this is Dan we're going out or open the door close the door these are all the parties that I do over the years this is a massive flag and I got a rope thing here let me keep speed before coming in I built those doors action Who am I I'm a guy that has parties with cotton candy machines scares the crap out of kids we have kickball games it's Christmas that's a crime it's Christmas that's primary that cooked and we cut it oh that's it like that that's 18 pounds of the high level stuff Halloween of course and then we got like another Christmas which is a different design you hear that humming sound that's basically like fives actin cleaners outside my place you guys have no idea who tells you what's good and bad I figured I'd show you the kind of effort that I put in to you know doing Christmas and stuff I don't do anything a little bit or kind of at all"

Altri prodotti FiiO da AVShop su Amazon: https://amzn.to/2Mn3TjG

Fiio X5 3gen (FX5321) è la terza edizione del Fiio X5 noto player audio ad alta qualità di FiiO. Per i possessori di X5 di prima e seconda generazione salterà subito all'occhio come a livello di design sia profondamento cambiato questo X5 di terza generazione. Spariscono infatti i tasti sulla parte anteriore per lasciare spazio ad un display che va ad occupare buona parte della parte anteriore. Anche a livello software molte le novità con la doppia modalità di funzionamento il tutto supportato da Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. Ma la cosa che rende davvero interessante questo X5 è il doppio DAC AKM AK4490EN, uno per canale. L'AK4490EN è un DAC high-end a 32 bit di nuova generazione che supporta tutti i formati PCM e DSD. L'esclusiva architettura a doppio DAC permette un filtraggio digitale e funzionamento a 32 bit a bassa distorsione.  In termini tecnici, il doppio chip arriva a -112 dB di distorsione armonica, 120 dB SNR e decodifica 32 bit/768 KHz. Al suo interno troviamo anche due oscillatori al cristallo separati di tipo OPA1642 sono utilizzati per i filtri passa basso DSD/44.1/88.2/176.4/352.8kHz, e l'altro per le frequenze 48/96/192/384kHz . Mentre due OPA426 Texas Instruments per l’amplificazione. Questo approccio garantisce bassissimi livelli di rumore ed elevata precisione nella riproduzione musicale su tutte le frequenze di campionamento, eliminando gli artefatti derivati dalla conversione. Grazie ai due OPA426 si potranno raggiungere i 300mW a 32Ohm e quindi sarà possibile pilotare anche cuffie di medie dimensioni. (Impedenza cuffie raccomandata: 16-150 Ohm). Decisamente interessanti queste caratteristiche, ma andiamo a vedere nel dettaglio questo FiiO X5 3rd gen nella nostra dettagliata recensione in italiano. Buona visione su Meck Hi-Tech!

here on mac and here we are today thanks to son we can try another device really very much interestingly it is a multimedia player we have already seen in passed on channel leaks a second generation you remember the release enrollment tenants to go see the decision is also the the amplifier portals really very interesting the 3 also this we have allowed but that estimate does I leave you the link below but let's go in order and let's see the contents of the box of this third generation x5 son as already you could however see which of you at the second generation x5 is already changed a lot aesthetically is also as we will see at the software level let's go then take out the package we open a moment here we obviously the small bag where our multimedia player was hidden inside we also had a chievo silicone cover already pulled out because I work applied to our device of good workmanship and quality I must say sometimes very well and protects the player well the pin to go April the two trolleys miss the two trolleys not because we are there there are sims as we are usually used to say but because this player actually hosts two micro sd see here on the side to expand the internal memory that of his it is already 32 gb and therefore already its not bad at all we have the usual manual manuals mi.to also put a cover in Really very stylish synthetic leather is really, really cool to wear in one utility to be prepared to ruin it but I must say that the situation also slowly hand is good quality and also the appearance is really very very pleasant we have the usb micro usb cable to go to recharge the device it is also true that you can attach it via the micro usb port below went to connect to computer then see it as an extension with a usb key to go and load the music inside directly through the computer and then we have this cannon inside that contains another adapter cable ok let's put it aside now let's go and see our device in detail our multimedia player well first of all the quality is really a lot good it is true at first sight is the truth is beautiful pond a little brochetto is not certainly wearable indeed dear friends to say this device is not made for sports so I went to hear the music to run for example but it is by no means for music lovers and for the travelers as well as tech buffs like we are here on mac hi tech build quality is really excellent we won for how much it's about the back that we have an award-winning titanium black coloring nal in aluminum I must say that it is built really very well meanwhile I'm going to wait for them here is one of the first problems in the sense one of the few rewards of gravity of this son x5 that you do not know but ethically when you are lit mentions a bit starting then 1 prize and then does not see which part they resume comes off in short, trust me, pressed the yes button for 5 seconds it will turn on this blue led when it is started anyway take it a couple of seconds five seconds like this and then let go of them quietly he will leave on the left we have some frets are really good quality really well made beautiful finishes of this player and the third generation 5 we have the play stop button we have this button to go silk retracted forward back and then here we have this really beautiful wheel too this well defined a socialist see knurled good condition and to some short shots so you can really go to the detail of the volume below we have a double output for the standard tremezzo headphones plus an ata for the balanced two and a half headphones we have a micro usb here on the side is here in addition we also have an output a line out is a coaxial output if we deem it appropriate to use it as you can see then already here we have a arrangement and i must say really good quality zahavi advance of this really great excellent excellent especially for wire multimedia player as far as the audio quality is concerned, what this device was born for then we have the front part that all display unlike the florists who we have seen in the past of the first second generation of his gunshots all the physical buttons in front and a mega touch display has taken hold display in the meantime I'm going to immediately make the brightness to the maximum ok so maybe you see a little more 4.97 inch ips tft display is a 400 to 800 touch resolution 233 ppi inside we give you immediately its features hardware those harder 6 that then we go to see more human ones in detail dedicated precisely to the audio part we have more than rockchip 3.188 quad core cortex a9 to 1.4gb 1gb ram 32gb internal memory expandable as I told you of which the 26 available practically at the start of the device we have as android operating system in fact this son stands out is based on android 5.1 then lollipop version is in fact here is one of the more things interesting I stop for a moment that dying card so that it can be done immediately see what the interesting thing is in fact this child can go in two software mode the first is pure music as you can see from this icon here or we can go to android mode if we go into android mode look magic astonishment will start practically a version of course but of the android distribution in the version precisely 5.1 what it means here means that you can go install all applications that you obviously want with limits of the case I remind you that below not we have a spy 8 to melee tends to do anything or we have a rock ship 3.188 precisely therefore it is quite essential because of debby use it is certainly more dedicated for audio reproduction where precisely this film 5 from the better in any case I could go to the street from the play store that is installed then you can go and install any application you see this side cpx youtube you can start applications without problems in the meantime I go to connect with wifi or wifi and bluetooth are also available on the civil flowers in third generation 2.4 wifi by gates bgne the bluetooth instead it is in version 4 with certifications from qualcomm apt then turn it down to low latency let's go and see a little while I am gone online we wait for it to go on wi fi that chelsea hooked quickly you saw why they practically go to watching any video quietly is like having a small phone led to a small not so much because its on average dimensions as I said are cluttered we have 66 mm wide by 144 beauty and a thickness of 15 mm then a centimeter and a half I must say that they brought it is not easy and heavy enough why we are around 190 g it is not very comfortable to carry but I must say that you are music lovers in a damn design or else of the weight this device is really very very interesting of game where we have the option to use the android version you see here we have all the various applications can even the most market where it could go install several applications precisely delfio market even if they are all practically in Chinese important thing to say that language There is no Italian but English has promised in the next eliezer of firmware to also update languages ​​so it should also arrive soon the Italian language is available we telegram the appropriate install whatsapp of course you will have to be connected uefa in a sim you cannot use the 3d of your sim card because it has no note and support for sim cards on the micro sd and therefore you must always use the wi fi to surf or chat through your favorite chat programs let's see a little to the point of information we have lolli tmo 511 labile that we have tried the 1166 day practically as soon as we turned on so excellent support too more even more over the years, however, it has accustomed us to show that it holds to his products he updates them quite often he tries to always fix the big problems big problems I have not encountered on this x5 maybe he has a little something to improve but I'm sure he will do it without any kind of problem we suffered from the options as well quickly we have the bluetooth wifi as we have seen we have all the part of if you to go enable inline and remote or to go to enjoy volume at low level we exit to go to set modes for the low pass filter is our multifunctional output if anything a coax car we speak out here too we can go to choose between double and two p the high low gain and the sound balance left or right let's say these are the characteristics quite barillary 3 thousand and 400 thousand battery and for now it will allow you to practically reproduce music for about 7 hours demi tester fiom says 10 oct I got to make 7 is true a fairly high volume perhaps even with quite large files of high quality so they are aimed at 7 hours cd charge in about three hours if you have the cv chargers available at two amperas less than two hours if you have a 12 volt charger one perennial so even charge types anyway are not at all hurt but let's move on to see some cool stuff after this really long hardware premise design and let's see the player player mode that is possible turn up both in the android version through this no keep the player di pio pio music is called or if you go to the mode I'll show you directly pur mode music modes activated directly to the application music and then you will not have to go to do anything pato in a swipe when we are inside the play to music you see a swipe to the right we exit going to set a sleep timer for the app music now pressed the one below ok you can go to choose between 10 20 minutes up to an hour and a half because the musique è will automatically switch off possible to give candle fares internal memory then to go searching for multimedia files then mp3 but not only as we will see below in the description leaves you all formats supported by this x5 thread like we will see them really supports many and especially heavy ones too great quality then to go to select them disk analyze all the our system or only a part through the selection of the leaves to look for it is also possible to say to update automatically the media library or doing it manually is possible go customize the display and our home screen is possible go set as i saw these are the shortcuts they bring back settings of the audio that we have seen before quickly see here we have a whole series of gain that always brings us into this screen and you can set the height which you can also do through the togo above quick I find quick that you see also here we have practically the same options we saw in the settings menu and the same options we saw in the left side menu then filters so we have a special earn out decide how to make it work the gain in this case sees passes directly without going to the settings screen, etc., etc. we have the output of setting the balance we have seen before has the possibility to go and customize album images as we will see if also the visit to automatically download the possibility to decide what is the custom volume then customized to set during the revolution keep it fixed assumes you will need it to recover from position or from the last song you left when you stopped there ability to go and do playback through folders years go see the album the album poster when it's the lockscreen and then the most interesting part is the viper effects we have so many several not all are enabled even more is working on it I must say that they work very well much better than the equalizer which is native to this one application you can precisely go to pump down go to compress go to qualify a whole series of options that those who are party to music surely will appreciate then we have the alps in line the barra delle applications I also show you the version you are using in this moment is version 3 3 1 let's go with order now let's go to actually seeing the succulent part we waited for a lot to do it up to me let's say we got this screen where we are told what our recent songs we have played are the most played songs we also have the songs recently added in short you see we have a shortcut to go and just see more things recent and the ones we have heard the most then we have these three icons that we will need to go and see the playlists we created you can go to create playlists indefinitely so in this case no create two so on the fly to demonstrate how just take more you see given a name you want of db and believe a playlist obviously in the playlist then you can go add all the songs you want we go back because once we go to reproduce something it will come to us represented the screen of the album cover that we are by playing it is possible to change track simply by doing a swipe left or right to over this part of the disk the icon central that will allow us to go inside our memory later having swapped our media files to see what they are inside precisely in our library and therefore we all have cataloged by title by the artist or we have cataloged by album or we can go see to hold you see the genre is taken from the tags of your files so I'm not here I was very good because I have four different ones and yet it's always about pop so I decided to put everything in our playlist allow for example an entire album or an ordinarily one playlist just swipe to the right we have specially from among the favorites precisely will add to a playlist like then see bisceglie the bat the idea is born what is the playlist or you can go directly to play through a through bluetooth through a bluetooth point device such as it could be for example a bluetooth speaker another thing we have the ability to see instead just as well as inside of our sd cards then in an internal note first cdc card with da sd cards and navigate right inside our fixed memory and I must say that playlists are very comfortable, I liked this structure a lot unlike the former second generation one is very quick to find the songs so I definitely have to promote the work he's done more regarding the management of the multimedia library clicking on the cover of the production album, however, we will enter the detail of the song we are playing so we have all details such as the title where does it come from who the artist quality in this case of the track we are listening to doing a swipe we can seeing vu meter here also gives us the output power we have an album cover making a tap we will go to see the liri or the lyrics of the song I have to say here is a bit lacking as the music researched is sought I do not know from which site it is not well specified in fact pressing these continue here you can go to download the text of the song let's try for example with this one even if you see more often than not it gives me lyrics not found since probably the artists are not international so it is a bit difficult to actually find the lyrics of the songs then we have various possibilities then look for the album cover and you could go and delete the lyrics that you have downloaded them from the album cover if you downloaded it and zoom in and zoom out and just when it sees the text for tame to see it bigger screen export 0 5 seconds playback but not asking whole practically in sync with the sound néstor come back back cancel will close the screen we then have the button for above back to the previous page I forgot to tell you that above you have an about that speaks global search within the device of yours memory 15 little man to 100 that a mixed song for example you see in the test immediately by clicking I can go directly to play the song that part below an ability to go and connect directly to dlna server then you can stream your music through the dot servers of training and of course as he saw me when we let the delusion of android for example, it will be able to create spotify, therefore also in that case through the wi fi hsdpa streaming your queen music online really very much convenient pity that it has no microphone that does not have a system speaker so you won't hear anything except through headphones from the side this is good because through the headphones I have to say it feels very very good there is a excellent balance between averaged bass in sound quality performance on the most ad good aero and parking you have seen really interesting updates ne have already arrived so also excellent child support as well as against against this son the 5 second there are so many sense that if you go buying such a product means that you are definitely lovers of music certainly not sportsmen so size and weight go by a bit in the background if you sider runners obviously I recommend you rather then leaks a second generation that weighs less is lighter and smaller definitely more portable but the most interesting thing I forgot to say this son x5 inside is equipped with two dates at km ak 4490 en1 bear channel the hood 4.490 n is a digital to analog converter 32 bit of new generation that supports all pc mb s formats of then we really are at the highest quality the unique double duck architecture allows a digital filtering and 32 bit operation with very low distortion and I guarantee you really feels very very good we point two opa mille race two site which are used for low pass filters while two opa 426s for amplification this guarantees very low levels of noise and high precision in music reproduction on all sample rates thereby eliminating those derivative artifacts precisely from the conversion from digital to analog in descriptions I leave you the really great purchase link this device is a little expensive yes it is true the quality plus you pay we are above 400 euros it is 440 euros to be exact from amazon has a little expensive if yes, however, the audio quality really worth all the money it costs it could have been better we got you in the it could be more up maybe the apps could be improved some features could be added that are missing but I must say that I am sure that child plan and will implement all requests that users will do good dual operating mode maybe more for nerds than to fascinate music lovers but online general is this option that you can freely choose to use or minus for this recession quite long enough depth a greeting from Matthew and his son the 5 god money god money io de na from the trio of son dena for mac hi tech Hello"

something that competes with the a still and current a K 240 which when this was reviewed multiple comparisons were made with the a K 240 very favorably so that's this one I'm gonna go ahead and open it up let me go ahead and do that this is one of those push types open it push that out we'll get the box it's a lift top take that out you've got the device and it's a biggie this is a big device and it's heavy to have the gear that it has in it and if it's as powerful as it said it is I suppose it has to be big that is beautiful and that's the back that is very very nice design in the front mmm look at all that real estate that is nice damn that's beautiful rotate it over on the bottom we've got we've got the line out we've got the USB micro-b for data transfer and charging and then we've got your headphone out on the side we've got a sliding trapdoor micro SD it's got 64 gigs onboard and you can expand this I bet guest as big as your card goes maybe 256 or more you've got the physical control buttons which are looks like previous play pause next and then you've got the power on the top you've got kind of like a rocker volume switch I've noticed that the more powerful a-class amp devices seem to have this kind of a volume and I'm not really sure why the top of the side of the device doesn't have anything on it so you've got a very very very large screen back has a slight slight bump to it little angle see the riser to keep all the circuitry and it's a very robust device now let me go ahead and start it up I have already started this thing up see if this is gonna do it for me oh we want to go zoom did you hear that no idea what that is okay - allottee high-resolution music player RM - and now we've got all of the bit rates and stuff flying at us like star wars movie it's pretty cool though I like it that's about as good animation as I've seen and that's pretty fast too if that's it and that is it I customized the start screen for the Maxell commercial guy that was it was very very easy slide out now touch this button and I can go to I installed Spotify see if I can get in there easy enough Wi-Fi zone am i right I'm right okay there we go oh and it's my boy Tupac okay so I got Spotify with no problem mmm absolutely no problem I'm going to here and just fly that out of there and then get back here and that is space analyzer look I do what that it moves it slide this down this will give you any activities that you doing settings take you into this is this minds me of I prefer Android because of the version that it's based on um storage tell me in my storage battery tell me what my battery's doing about device just so I can see build number V two point five point six point zero is what we're on right now let me get out of there now they have a all they have a are music player as you can see right there that red one and then they have a are music player pro let me go ahead and hit the pro now when you're looking at this you can see this is you a PP that they reconfigured usually you a PP is used for adapting external device by OTG but recently some some gaps have been collaborating with them to make and this is the the speed of this device is is actually pretty impressive there's I'm not having any issues with the album art loading and this is good size album art god this is beautiful this is a beauty beauty beauty beauty oh well let's go to the classic let's go down and we'll try time now something that I noticed is that this will not play unless I have headphone plugged in I don't know if that's a so for example if I push play I don't think any okay this plane seemed like before it wouldn't work unless I was jacked in but in fact I guess it's doing it so if you familiar with you a PP you're very familiar with this now let me start that again I didn't know that it had this on it I knew that it had and BAM there we go I knew that I had the other player because I had seen it before but I wasn't aware of this this is not a review video because I haven't really listened to it enough to give you a review but this is kind of like an unboxing so since its I'm doing an unboxing did I unbox it yet not really take this out you've got your little cradle thing inside that you've got explanation there's nothing else in there you don't have a screen protector or anything like that you don't need one so far as I can tell I'd rather have this just the way that it is inside the box you have regional adaptors for whatever country that you're in so I don't know what the country dad is or if that's for an airplane perhaps in American in Japan we use this one and then in in Europe I don't know uses this one comes with this little your wall wart basically I'm an American living in Japan but I'll go ahead and blue back and slide that in and I'm good to go connects by USB I got the USB cable right here so I'm ready to go as far as transferring data through the cable charging it with the charger doesn't matter where I live in the world apparently these diesel do it haven't seen a dab that came with stuff like that yet I have listened to this a little bit last night Wow really really nice like the kxm another one of those devices that I'm just stunned it doesn't have a bigger fan base and I know that this is because they don't do tours and they're very tight with their equipment because when I reached out and tried to get stuff from them they were not having any of it so I had to you know go out and get one and we've you will be coming I'll also do a comparison with the x7 because they're both large they're both Android based and this sounds really good from what I've heard so far but this is not a sound review so this is the unboxing kind of and a little demo of the device and go back home and next will be a sound review and I'll do a full video and then a second video will be this compared with probably the Opus 2 and also the file X 7 second generation so look out for that ok

number three in its case I'm going to do a review of the device probably in about a week or two after I really give it a good listen to I listen to it very briefly and have awesome impressions of it II listen you like stuff right away or you don't I like this right away opus has a house sound apparently and if you know what I'm talking about Sony for example Sony has a kind of sound and I didn't know that I liked it until I realized that I've got the ex1000 AE X 800 and the ma900 and I would never sell any of those and I have a pH a three and I like most Sony high-end apps so I guess I like the Sony sound and there's other things that I don't like to sound up and I know it right away when I plug this in I knew this was either going to be a polite you know hey this is the newest thing and the you know or I was going to start raving about it and I'm raving about it because it sounds awesome no EQ no problem although it's got EQ and you can you've got 5 presets that you can save it sounds just fantastic now let me get into what is the thing about the three Wi-Fi Bluetooth line out same stuff that it had before but what you've got now is streaming now I hit streaming it's got Spotify already on it and it should take me to my stream and there we go or online do I need this you know streaming for me is about 10% of my listening and the other 90% is listening to the device so this opus number three has the 10% covered and the other 9% it's a I don't need an EQ to listen to music type of situation so it is very nice I'm going to do a review of it probably like I said in a week or two after I get good listen to it it is really really nice and opus does have a house sound because I love the 11 amp tach I love the 1.5 metal and I love the two I just couldn't hear a huge difference between the 1.5 and the two honestly to this day I still can't say I really really heard that much of a difference but I did like both of the devices and you know lo and behold I like this too so whatever that Opus sound is that they're going for I apparently like it a lot it sounds really really nice so look forward to a review of this coming out soon really nice do a little close-up of it inside the case it is trimmed to form very very nicely you can access the I love blowing music click I don't know why I just love that fit like a glove getting this thing on and off is not easy talk to the device and like that okay this is a one centimeter zoom it's made out of aluminum it doesn't have it's a got no color whatsoever it's basically a block of aluminum now looking at the top of the device again a beautiful device everything they make is like art you've got the balanced out at the top you've got the power and the sleep button then you've also put the headphone out looking at it from the top down then on what would be your left hand side of the device you've got your next previous track play pause on that side on the bottom of the device you've got your one SD slot and your micro USB something to take a look at why are you looking at this right here I do a lot of videos of these and the tolerances for some stuff including expensive ones are sometimes a little bit iffy this is a one centimeter zoom and the gap between the micro USB in the frame the aluminum frame is is you couldn't fit a piece of paper in there that's up tight that is arm these guys do a really good job when it comes to how they present the device it screams quality all the way around and then again that's the bottom then you rotate to the opposite side and you've got the same thing that you saw on the previous side with the volume at the top which I'll show you later so this is the bottom of the device except the micro USB it's got a perfect tolerance because the one uncovered SD slot you've got basically they call this diamond-cut in America because people like their trucks and stuff they get the step ups and they call diamond-cut so I guess that's what you call that you get the buttons right there and then again on the top you've got headphone out balanced out power pause and then right there on this side you can see the bottom of the volume wheel and that is the one centimeter close-up it's it's a beautiful device everything they make is beautiful really really nice if it just looked nice this just I'm going to listen to this and I mean I have not actually even listened to it but I've loaded it with music so I'm going to listen to it now okay this is the unboxing you'll probably be watching this last because this is people who want to see this concede is people who don't can skip it because it's the end of the video so you can you can leave now it's number three got the specs on the back it's in silver on grey so it's really hard to read sounds long so look about you got a nice box plus number three high res audio take the top off and you get the unit it's absolutely beautiful as all of their units are take this out buddy knows how I am about to screen so I don't want to touch this and had a cover on it I already took the cover off inside the box take out the lining focus number three this is uh this is a warranty card user's manual and fair cover it comes inside of I don't behind you decipher this stuff does somebody else isn't into a video and you guys take a look at that inside the box and you need to device now this is I'm said to be an optional item so look inside the box and you've got opus in between genuine leather case and then below you've got the cables the case came separately to me it's noteworthy because the original cover was a kind of a gray and it was also not real leather and I ended up I don't know if was whether or not didn't smell like real leather it definitely didn't look like because it was gray this one on the other hand is genuine leather and it's black and it smells like leather on the other one never did so this is a nice I like this black that's cool so this this is an optional item that comes with it and then the device would sit inside and look like that actually looks pretty sharp and black with the difference I need to cut all the way in and that's what it looks like don't forget the little chicken roll wheel you can rinse into the volume you'll click and I like that it's shot these guys are really good when it comes to like design everything that they make is kind of a like artwork it's very very very very sharp so if that's the unboxing it also comes with a USB not type-c the regular USB cable so and it's right here you guys want me to pull it out mm sorry not going to do it and I'll do a head go ahead and do a close up it you probably would have seen already by the time you see in this

player|review|audiophile|DSD|lossless|balanced|headphones,2020-10-07 10:14:19.929674, how's it goin everybody David here from primordia reviews and today we've got the Shandling m5s high res portable music player this thing retails for about four hundred and twenty nine dollars it's only the second Shandling dat and I've tried but this is their flagship model it has dual a K 44 93 EQ Dax it runs on channelings em touch operating system supports DSD playback up to DSD 256 it has Wi-Fi it has bluetooth with L DAC aptX AAC it's got two way Bluetooth so it can transmit and receive Bluetooth it's got a 17 hour battery life anyway enough of that preamble there's the back there's the front let's open it up because I'm keen to have a look at this thing whoo hello that looks fantastic let's pop this out it is really nice that feels great it looks far better in person than it does in photos this one and it feels nice too but we'll get back to that for now let's get on with the unboxing and see what else is in here and you get a lovely braided USB type-c cable nice little cable is that all we get oh there is some more okay you get user manual and warranty card that is a really bare-bones package this the bare minimum that's quite surprising but anyway let's have a closer look at this beauty I can't remember the dimensions off the screen I might pop them up you've got your forward button play pause your rewind or previous button here is the channeling wheel on the original m5 they've had a dial on the front in the top corner but lately it seems they're putting the side wheel on all of their devices on the bottom there is USB type-c port 3.5 millimeter headphone out and a 2.5 millimeter headphone out eventually I'm gonna have to take this case off I'll be back once that's done and the reason I wanted to remove it is to show you the where the SD card micro SD card slot is that is the micro SD card slot quite difficult to access and look at that isn't that pretty so on the back you've got this sort of tip tempered glass back which is clear and you can see the Shandling logo below beneath it but that is that is a very very pretty little device feels but good in the end there's a nice weight to it feels very robust and sturdy as well anyway I won't switch it on now I will go and give this a run through this will become my daily driver for the next week or two and then I'll I'll be back to report my experience with it ok guys so I've been using the Shandling m5s for a few weeks now and so far I have enjoyed my experience quite a lot quite a great deal here are some other depths in particular water for size comparison is the sony in wzx 300 the acoustic research a rm20 sound aware m2 pro ATC HD ADP 20 the eye bass odx 120 and the com6 and of course the focus of today's video the Shandling m5s first of all just going to talk a little bit about the build quality this thing is fabulous in terms of build quality actually out of all these steps here this one feels the most premium when it's in your hand the the quality of the materials and the way it's built is just amazing actually the where it transitions from the aluminium to glass on the back of the chassis is just flawless it's amazing feels fantastic I'll just switch it on you of course it's running the em touch to version 2 of Shandling's own proprietary user interface their own software ok let's have a look at the settings real quick this is the main screen this is the home screen so you can browse all songs of course it just gives you one long list of songs limited using that high res files it gives you a list of all the high res files and it's the same kind of thing you can you can browse by artist you can browse by folders here is the playback menu where you can set your max volume the default volume the resume mode gap was playback the EQ I have people have complained about the EQ saying that it's not very effective to ten band EQ I wouldn't know I don't use EQ so if you want to find out more about that you'll have to do that somewhere else high and low gain settings here are the digital filters you've got your usual sharp roll off slow roll off etcetera channel balance the play mode and folder skip option now in the system menu you have update music library wireless setting where you can turn on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Wi-Fi file transfer now this is a very handy feature which allows you to copy files from another device on the same network brightness screen brightness the idle timer sleep timer USB mode which can be set to USB card reader or external USB DAC I did test this on my Windows 10 PC is an external deck and it work perfectly there are also no sync issues with video everything's perfectly synced you can set the clock the lock screen double-click to wake up which is the side button here double tap to waken up default is single click you can lock the buttons oops here you can lock the buttons you can lock the buttons only or the volume only or both these buttons that is DSD output mode USB audio output you can have variable level or fixed level you have a choice of three different themes the first one the default one is a colorful theme theme too is sort of more simplified like that change that back to the colorful one enlarged album heart now this what this does is on the nail playing screen after 10 seconds of inactivity it will remove why don't I just show you instead here go to a high res play a high res file now after 10 seconds you will see the playback controls disappear the album art will enlarge hopefully otherwise I look a bit silly there it goes so that's pretty cool some people will appreciate that personally I'm leaving it off for the moment select a language about the device reset to factory settings default factory settings and system update which you can do from the SD card or over the Wi-Fi network and back to the narrow playing screen oh I missed here's basically more just music browsing options you can create a playlist or you can add files to your favorites search by composer search by album and here's where you can browse by album art but you've also got the alphabetical search feature here as you can see the OS is very responsive it's very smooth there's no stuttering or anything once the album art sort of loads the first time it'll be there so you can yeah see it's nice and smooth no complaints there recent files recently played files frequently played files and recently added which is mm files music you've recently added to the SD card now back to the now playing screen you can add a song to your favorites here change your play mode here and if you tap on the screen you get these options I this takes you this is a shortcut to the playback settings and you can use this button to add the song to a playlist or you can delete the file if you swipe left it takes you to the lyrics screen obviously I do not have lyrics for this song and if you swipe again it'll take you to the file information and will tell you the the bitrate the sample rate things like that so all pretty good the screen yeah pretty nice nice colors it's not the most detailed or whatever but you don't need any more than that some people won't why the fact that the lower part of the front isn't used for the screen if that bothers you go for an Android device or something like that is an Android device something like the payaso D X 120 which uses the full screen about the OS I like it it's basically the same as the I be so mango iOS which I'll show you here a right swipe take you to the main settings screen and main settings screen there versus this personally I actually prefer the mango OS I think although they're so close the only real difference apart from these screens here is you don't have to go back back again yeah the only difference is when you're searching through the lists here the m5s has this sort of quick search feature which you can via which you can search alphabetically this one you just have to scroll through manually but apart from that they're very similar actually these devices they're the way they operate is also very similar the only real difference is this one has Wi-Fi and bluetooth because it runs on Shandling's in touch to software it doesn't have native Spotify or title but you can because it has bi-directional Bluetooth you can hook it up to your phone I tested it earlier using it with my phone and playing Spotify it worked perfectly I did a firmware update over the network it worked perfectly connects to my Wi-Fi no problems at all now the battery life on this is fantastic it's rated at 17 hours and I found that during my testing that's about pretty accurate I listened to flat files at moderate low to moderate volume I was getting that time out of it main selling points of this step the build quality the battery life the ease of use it's very simple to use the speed of the operating system and and obviously the sound I will talk briefly about the sound here but I'll go more into detail about the sound in my written review but I will say it does sound fantastic if you are familiar with the Shandling house sound you'll sort of know what to expect it has a fairly neutral sound signature with a little bit of enhancement in the base area it's gonna slightly subdued but very Airy treble and soundstaging is very good that's going to depend a lot on your earphones or headphones but the sound stage is good but more about that in the written review output power you won't have any problems driving just about any in ear monitor I was actually playing I was actually using the - and Sundara with this before and it worked perfectly on high gain of course but I was on about 60 to 70 volume and had a fair bit of headroom there but I don't listen to music that loudly but just so you got an idea that's about all I have to say for the moment great dat channeling in 5 s definitely worth checking out if you're in the market balanced output Wi-Fi bluetooth immaculate build quality beautiful physical playback buttons everything just great all around so yeah if you liked the video do stupid things with those stupid YouTube buttons below what do you think about the m5s leave a comment below what's what daffy you using what dap you excited about do you have an m5 s do you want to get one let it let me know in the comments and I will see you in the next video whose

p front we are trying to give you tube to digital and that can be done but you have to have exclusion the year 2000 turn of the century internet everything came a very musical revolution important on a planetary level that turned everything around I'm from the generation napster, that is, these guys changed the industry, they changed the way we distribute the music, the laptops were opened and the signals and quality of emotion started to worsen and I waited quite a bit sometimes it is privileged more how much than qualitative the quality is no longer it weighs a lot what people are looking for is portability today. you can hear many different things having them in a very small device that happened to do and the effective way to sell now but also and lose a little and the quality of noticing any there was some low that when compress mp3 disappears nerd I try not to listen to mp3 I don't do it out of necessity obviously it's full of lemaitre as for example we have all these panels this software or web sound and everything transfers to a channel this key red that the mpt compresses all these channels and quality is lost and at the moment of listening and adjusting or removing things that are bad, you will perceive badly and leave getting used to that the stress that produces blurry signals is the same just like sight, hearing is a sense that gets tired and we are at a point in which our generation who enjoy the ease here in an mp3 is already being giving account either for or for a social theme for a theme of taste or for a accessibility issue we are returning to vinyl that era that it was very plastic in that there was a lot of digital effect and a lot of that sound disgusting that is the sound of the beginning of digital technology starting to passing through today is a cross between analog and digital and is very interesting livelihood before was much more valued the delicacy of the sounds and also add to this another problem that it is already much more sound than is the uar that is like the space race for generating unusual volumes of content between the song the devil that is there and is that we all want that we want the vinyl we want the heat we are looking for the quadraphonic man who had pink floyd we are looking for the sound quality that can could have emerson lake and palmer i like it and i know people who likes music values ​​listening to details of the recordings and we give ourselves that time the productions and you believe that you have to be a musician or be that is not easy not one wastes a lot of time studying time traveling one gives something nice for the other to water and that has a positive gesture and one creates atmosphere where you put one guitar behind the other and add a cello string that make you excited and that makes people excited but people do not know it is fine but I think that little by little people go valuing this is this being so meticulous and being as delicate as a painting and what desire that people could be somehow in these sessions i then I wish everyone had shortages like these and I wish everyone enjoyed the mixes as I do in my space and if there is a device that can help how to bridge the work of the studio and what comes after people It would be fantastic that is how people can be with us while while we are recording many many people can buy the discs and enter which is another higher quality and it exists and people do it because they are already understanding that he is going to gain much more richness in the sound and he is valuing it that is already happened as well as the goldman who were the most now there are reducers there are res audio which means high resolution I would love that the work that the studio is doing hopefully and people I would have listened as I do studying the entire list that I hear I like this artist I want to hear it in full but I want to hear it well and people listen to our work as we imagine it s my sun"

Here the video unboxing of a product I've been excited to get It's the Audio Tranport Dock for Hi-Res Audio Walkman from Sony Model: BCR-NWH10 It's Made in Malaysia &amp; it's a Japan market exclusive I don't know why but it's sold only in Japan Let's have a look around Design matches the Hi-Res line, very simple &amp; B/W This side shows the multi connections available Some Japanese content OK, let's open it Firstly, there is the accessories box And the dock is just below It's well wrapped, like a gift :D So here it is! Very minimalist cubic design, Dock is made of metal: aluminum, quite heavy And the central part is made of rubber type plastic Probably to avoid scratching the walkman while docking/undocking There are 4 rubber feet About connecting options The dock has 3 features 1rst: charging walkman with WM-port 2nd: Audio/Video/Picture files transfer from Computer to Walkman 3rd: Audio transport via USB Digital Out Due to Walkman limitation, Audio transport is up to 24/192 We don't know yet if Sony will allow DSD output via ZX2 in near future, let's wait &amp; see oh yea, there is also a slider to switch from Audio transport mode to PC mode Don't forget to switch mode for either function Let's see the accessories now Everything is in the box You got a user manuel Let's take it all out You have 3 spacers, I'll talk about it later A USB/microUSB cable to connect the dock to Sony portable DAC/amp such as PHA-3/2/1A And finally the AC Adaptor. Everybody wonders if it's a worldwide one And the answer is here: YES its is! 100-240V / 50-60Hz So you can import it and use it everywhere The AC adaptor has a common connector You just need to buy the local cable you need Of course the box contains the cable with the Japanese outlet connector Now the spacers You get 3 of them There are 3 sizes, from thicker to thinner The thickest is for Walkman A10 The middle one, for ZX1 And the thinnest is for ZX2 due to its thickness There is a little bay And the spacer has an insert Docking is quite easy The dock is compatible with all Sony Walkman that have WMport For example, the Walkman X Since it's not a Hi-Res Walkman, only Charging &amp; File transfer is possible Transport mode is not possible Transport mode is for Hi-Res Walkman ZX2, ZX1, A10, F only Since the dock is powered, Audio Transport should be working with all DAC From Sony, you can use it with the DAC UDA-1, Hi-Res Wireless Speakers SRS-X9/X99 And of course, portable DAC/amp such as PHA-3 Here a deskstop set up which allows you to enjoy the sound of the PHA-3 while charging the ZX1 The dock is compatible with PHA-3, PHA-2, PHA-1A That's all for today!

202,37cKfwaO0LE,John Darko,UCQIcXQ2n0sa-7CD0NtqnrrA,Do I listen to hi-res audio when reviewing audio gear?,"No, not very often -- and not because I don't hear slight improvements in sound quality with some DACs but because I'm driven by pragmatism, not idealism. So few modern music titles are issued in hi-res but EVERYTHING comes out as 16/44.1, either on CD or via Tidal/Qobuz.

204,x5994RQMf7Y,Steven Hoang,UCh0Vyv-JLrsgsggaERoquSQ,Onkyo DP X1 Hi Res Portable Music Player Overview Part 2/2,This video is to provide an overview of the Onkyo DP-X1 Hi-Res Portable Music Player - Part 1/2,28,5653,8.0,27.0,5.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x5994RQMf7Y/hqdefault.jpg,Onkyo|DP-X1|Music Player|Hi-Res Audio|Lossless Music|DSD|MQA,2020-10-07 10:14:20.302715, so moving on we're going to talk about file support which is this divide here support a really wide range of file type in which other a flag a lack ways mp3 and many many other ones that listed under their technical specs that you can find so one of the really important functionalities from the device as file is it has the DSD conversion we just stand for direct stream digital so it does give capability to have a real-time DSD conversion in which is going to convert any mp3 files a flat files a lag files into DSD quality types of audio files so you can have your listening experience as the highest level so the next thing is the battery life from the manual it shows that the battery life could last up to 12 16 hours however in my case I found that I will get between 10 to 12 hours of music playing even that the device is not being used for any other purpose for example seeing this is the import device you can actually play music surfing internet or playing any other games or apps at the same time however in my case the device is just in the plane mode hundred percent so it is pretty decent very life for given that it's such a powerful device with many functionalities built in so another thing I'd like to show you is from the top you've Reece wiped out here is kind of like a fast menus or quick menu access in which is going to give you the access to adjust your brightness up screen access enable and disable Wi-Fi Bluetooth so there are some other features here cause stand alone mode and airplane mode so what are those two the standalone mode in which you would like to experience your music to the highest level in which you can turn on this mode what it does is turn off your screen it turn off any other app or any connections such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to prevent it from getting any interference just to focus on playing your music alone and it's also in crease your bearing light him that way one downside of it is you're not be able to see your screen or do anything because it will turn off everything so the only option for you to use at the time is the side button here where you can play pause next or previous your track and the airplane mode it skylit works similar to the other mode however it does not turn off your screen but if you prefer you can actually still be able to turn on your Wi-Fi or Bluetooth at the time the airplane mode is on and the other one is auto rotate in which if you leave it on you are using a web or something when you turn the device the screens are not going to rotate just like any other smart devices like iPhone or Android phone and whatnot so there light out mode what happened is for the light light out and the headphone jack be using the same port so if you connect this device to any other receivers or any audio device this line mode should be turned on what it does is going to make your volume at the highest level in which it does have a 160 steps volume you can either adjust from the dial here or you just tap on the line here and raise it up and down and it will do the job and our output select is the last option here where is going to allow you to select your output either using a balance port and/or a CG right so it it gives you the options of how you want your output going to be so overall in my own opinion this is such a beautiful sexy device that I would like to own in terms of the performance is pretty great it's got a slick design the build seemed to be pretty solid when you hold it it does give the really solid feeling and fancy looking so to protect this device from being slammed scratch and all I actually purchased a pouch that appeared to be made by Onkyo as well if you search for a cover for this divider there is not many of them out there is really few and it appeared to be this one I had to import it from Japan as well this is the leather case where you can just slide the device in here and it's going to sit nicely and snug great so let me go ahead and show that to you so this is how it look after being put the cover on and it's pretty nice only one complain not complain but it's actually what I found is not perfect is we can see the gap here so let me see if we can get the clearness here okay so once we put it all the way in it still has a little gap here that's sticking out so I would prefer to have that kind of light flush with the top part but in this case it's not that way so pro and con this device has so many Pro to talk about in which is pretty powerful device slip these eyes and everything so we already talked about it so the cons on this device itself I felt that that part to point that I would like to point out the first one is also being complained by other user is let's see here so the headphone port here as we can see on the screen is actually not really fit tight with is casing so what happened is there's there is the gap of the hole and the jack port is self so once you plug your headphone jack in is give some play in which this can we go a little bit so in the long time what happened potentially it could lose some connection inside and that that is a bill report by many users in my case I don't have that problem yet but that potentially could be seen seen it actually does not have a tight fit here that I can move it a little bit here the second point I'd like to point it out is the four buttons on the side here they are really nice but however the age of these buttons are extremely sharp so if you run your finger through like this you will have the feeling that your finger got caught by those ages it just has the same feeling that you run your finger through a knife or something I mean it's not as sharp as a knife however is pretty sharp in my case so how overall is a beautiful device I enjoy it I definitely would recommend you to get one if you are into music and portable portable device thanks for watching

lossless music you'd want to buy WAV files around to buy high resolution music then doesn't make that much sense because your iPod will play a simple mp3 file as well as these built but if on the other hand you love your headphones and you really want to see how good music can sound then this is the way to go and also remember when it comes to the price point if you're assembling speakers and amp and a CD player and trying to get really good quality music from that it's gonna cost you a bundle of money with this you can hear perfect sound with just a really good pair of headphones doesn't cost more than ten twelve thousand rupees and one of these it costs about thirty five thousand rupees or there abouts one second and then and then of course you got to buy the high resolution music okay so all this is interesting for sure it is the future but which is the real future we'll compare these we'll also throw in the Lego phone to find out if a mobile phone with the digital music could actually be better than this because one of them when you see digital music although this is a digital music I think what you got to say is high resolution music which is therefore not mp3 or even it so we're gonna be commuting the exact same file at a lakh or exactly the same file on all three let's take a look so let's just go over some of the points that we have been discussing first of all form factor and in this the shootout between the assailant curve and the fear is not even close this is a fantastic slim beautiful looking form factor this is funky at the best of time some people complain about the edges in this I think it's okay it's not really gonna cut you form factor very clearly this wins when it comes to the user interface and the operating system this uses Android this has its own and again personally I would prefer this to the Android but then maybe that's just me crucial question of course will eventually come down to sound quality how do these sound and how does it compare with what we were just discussing simple music from our iPhone or an iPod and also a new generation of forms that is now available with does come with with these not this for example doesn't have the 3.5 jack this is the laical as which has been rumored with the iPhone which is gonna have people say just a lightning connector this again you can just plug this in like this and hear music directly now how would that compare with one of these two high-resolution tracks well it just put the entire thing to the test starting off and lets us have the same piece of music in all of these these devices so I'm gonna hear Coldplay and I'm going to start off with hearing it basically and simply on an iPhone so this is a AC this is what you get on iTunes and let's just hear what it sounds like so here's the thing this is music the way you and I normally listen to it on our devices this is an mp3 it's playing and if you never heard the difference you may not be able to know what you're really missing the minute you'll shift to high resolution though the difference is immediate it is dark and I can't tell you how good it sounds so you know I have to tell you the minute though you switch to this thing to that same track of music in high resolution the difference is staggering and I know it's a bit unsafe if you can't see what I'm talking about but the difference is absolutely massive you'll start hearing details that you didn't know existed you will start hearing little pieces of instrumental music thing down here which you haven't ever heard before it's it's really quite an experience it's the same difference actually from watching standard definition on television and watching high-definition on television that's a sort of a difference now this is high-res how does this high-res compare let's just try and choose between the acelin Kern and the field so here's the Ashland gun look personally and sometimes this becomes a matter of personal choice I would prefer the sound and this also to the feel but both sound really good so let's just show you both of these in some details I'll give you my take we feel the best way to conduct a shootout between these two devices would be on the basis of three parameters design and build quality the design when the estar and current J are is sturdy and sharp quite literally it has edges that dig into your fingers but if you're going to be more of a pocket user that shouldn't be a problem there's a handy volume rocker on the back that can be rotated to control the output volume and I starch speaking of pockets the Pheo x7 is a large and bulky device it feels as sturdy as the a and KJ are but it's certainly a handful when it comes to portability however a beautiful blue light that the device emits from the bottom does make it look oh so appealing user interface a sterling con have fitted their very own interface on the junior we feel that while the interface is simple and has all the right functions in all the right places it's not the quickest of the lot the touch scroll is quite slow to respond and we wish there were a better way to implement it the Pheo x7 on the other hand runs on Android the OS has two modes pure music mode and Android mode the first one allows for more music center device performance while the latter allows you to use apps like Google Chrome or use a file manager to browse through your files at length sound quality now when it comes to judging something as subjective as sound quality we believe it's all about the personal experience but we all know which one is Vikram's favourite

which I believe is a combination of HiFi and i/o for you know bits and bytes ones and zeros but file is a company that's well been around for a while now actually and they have a whole line of product through the years at all centered around - yo so headphones in your headphones DAC processors and players and so much more and what we have today is their m9 dap or dop or digital audio player a hi-fi digital audio player this is actually their brand new and their it just came out and it has a lot to offer so this is something i'm gonna check out later once we've done the full review on this because we're gonna have a whole story at POC network dotnet we're gonna start off today with an unboxing which just kind of shows you what's inside the box what our initial opinions of what it looks like and to point out some of its features then you'll go to the website for more so first let's go ahead and pop this thing open and see what it looks like now you have on there products you have this unique barcode this little sticker here on the side that has a little scratch off on it which is really nice because it allows you to verify the authenticity of their products to make sure they're you're not that you're not actually buying into any kind of knockoff that's being sold somewhere else well you know for a fact you're getting true file quality so once you've opened that up you'll find a box within the box that has all the content in it and you're immediately brought to the player itself it's really cool it also has it comes in its own little plastic case here this protective case which is a neat kind of an add-on there you don't have to buy a case for it or anything like that just go helps to shield it from getting scratched or damaged well it slides in and out of your pocket or other forms of storage there's a lot of girth to this thing there's a lot of weight to it it's really nice you know there's a lot going on inside of this thing there's a touch screen display on the front we already accidentally turned it on as I was pulling it out of the box it immediately brought you to a menu where you select your language we chose english so we got that out of the way so we don't accidentally press anything we didn't want you have multiple different options right right off the bat here including feo music file management gallery technical support settings kkbox titled Nettie's music and move MOV move and I believe there's additional options maybe even I want to say Spotify that's in there but it might be an add-on yet maybe you have to download it it does have Wi-Fi it offers bluetooth you have multiple different options running across the site here you have a power button here which is what we accidentally turned turned it on with running it out of the box you have a volume wheel right here which sets the volume of the device you have a well kind of buttons that don't really have anything printed on them which looks like it's just probably a selection and then an up-and-down option here and then you have a micro SD and now that we notice it this is not a plastic case it's actually a rubber case so a little extra protection since it'll actually absorb more than solid plastic on the bottom here you have a USB type-c connection that's actually two ways so this is used for charging the actual player with but it can also connect to a computer and be used as a USB DAC for music coming off of the computer which is just makes it one step cooler you have two headphone jacks right here you have your typical 3.5 millimeter for headphones and you also have Orb line out and you also have a 2.5 millimeter balanced connection there as well there's just a little like I said there's a lot going with this little guy there's definitely some some weight to it some girth front to back you know there's a lot of hardware inside here that probably makes this as cool as we assume it's going to be so we're gonna go further into the box here for accessories and then we'll talk about a few more features in terms of what it has but you have a USB type-c to USB connection here and again this would be for charging it so connecting it to a computer and charging it or you can connect it to a wall adapter for a little quicker charge or you can connect this to the PC and just use it as a USB DAC amplifier you have a converter here that goes 3.5 millimeter to coax because it actually offers its one thing I forgot to mention that 3.5 millimeter actually offers a digital coax out ability for devices again that support coax you will have to provide your own coax digital cable but this gives you the adaption to go from the 3.5 to coax connection the only thing else you'll find in this box are the instructions you have various different you have this Quick Start Guide for example that is it might not be as quick but it does come with multiple different languages so it's probably gonna be a little bit quick but there's kind of a lot don't be too alarmed by this thankfully like I said there's multiple different languages here you only have to pay attention to some of it which is if you're looking for English really just right here all the other stuffs alternate languages so it doesn't matter where you are in the world they want to make sure that you are not gonna run into any issues with their player here it's that again is your Quick Start Guide here you have born for music and happy notes on using Bluetooth enabled devices so using this as a Bluetooth player you can stream to wireless headphones and what's really nice is this you know this is an all-around device and we'll get to that actually in a second but it supports all the same stuff for the most part that it does with wired connection as it does Wireless almost bluetooth is not perfect don't get me wrong but it's it has your back you have a open-source licenses little document here just talks about stuff legal stuff and you have a warranty card to talk about how long it's warranted for so about those features this actually supports hwa apdex aptX HD and L DAC which are all lossless bluetooth codecs and is that way when you were actually using bluetooth headphones you're still getting really good quality out of the music you're listening to from the player itself obviously a wired pair of headphones that are really nice you're gonna sound better than bluetooth because again bluetooth is not perfect not yet at least but it's really made to have your back there no matter what kind of headphones you're listening to it's gonna deliver the best music possible coming from a small little player like this I already mentioned the fact that it's a USB DAC amplifier as well on top of everything if you want to use it connected to a laptop or a computer you have that coaxial output option for digital out and you have Wi-Fi so it connects to your network it has for the year updates so any firmware updates or anything to the machine software updates to the machine to the player will do will happen over the air and on top of that that's what also feeds the streaming services like title on top of everything when you're not and when it's not plugged into an computer and being used as a USB deck and you're actually just using it as a portable player with a full battery charge this will give you up to ten hours of listening on a single charge which is cool it'll get you get you through a full day a busy day and without having to worry about running it back to an outlet somewheres to charge it so there you go this is the file m9 dap or digital audio player so from this point forward you're gonna want to go to our website go to POC no or.net we're gonna have a story about this coming up that's going to go going to go into great detail about what we think about it what we like about it and share with you anything we found during our testing of it so POC network dotnet and if you liked

Hidizs AP-100 High Resolution Digital Audio Player. The company’s flagship DAP is based on the Cirrus-Logic CS4398 and has a collection of nicely laid out components, circuits and filters.

It plays many lossless formats (PCM, FLAC, WAV) and has software support for DSD as well.

This unit is the next step to fiiO X1 and the XDuoo X3, competes directly with the fiiO X3 and the XDuoo X10, and goes as far as taking on the fiiO X5 at half the price.

protruding outside everything's protruding outside which is nice back button so we have this on the front forward rewind skip tracks volume back button we've got the SRC source button here and we've got an EQ button here which is nice these are screw ends yeah on top we've got right think the line out and the headphone out ports jacks I've got the power button up top and this must be the lock button yes surely must be the lock button and down here we've got the the first as the microUSB of course you can see that in the middle is the memory card slot and we have coag's in coag's out you know on the silver since it's written in white it's hard to actually see because of my phone's flashlight anyhow let's go ahead and power it up now let's get things up and running nice the screen is deep inside not very up close to the top which is good the resolution feels very nice the buttons that salted clicks yeah feel solid yeah the resolution is actually as nice as I saw in one of those videos for this device so you did say that you just have the play button and the Settings button so in the Settings button you've got the play mode I think you browse up and down with the forward rewind keys play mode just loop lyric display off storage mode storage but there can't be any other oh ok so DAC yeah I found out that they updated the firmware the older versions of the staff did not support the deck function but with a new firmware update it now does support the DAC function which is very reassuring now ok the screens gone off alright we're back on I think there's a screen off timer replay remember play position on/off that's good gapless playback on my favorite channel balance user-defined EQ volume limit auto shutdown time language backlight brightness let's see how much that is okay this is Fulbright they're like three or four quarters this is the least bright this is good brightness guys I can see very comfortably and clearly what I'm doing here even with this flash and the face of the death okay gotta do something about the timer back like time okay we go here I just a time fifteen seconds it was ten was good to at least a minute yeah that should be enough to change theme I can change the theme alright blue must be the last okay blue green blue green okay these two teams here that's fine blue is actually pretty fine with me anyhow hello control I do not know what that is I'll find out later update music library we store factory defaults the menu is pretty detailed as detailed as it can be for a digital audio player and I'm very hopeful with this device powering down now I disaster I'm very hopeful I can feel the weight of this device for a long time now you know I've just been running things off my phone so this is my first major tap and I look forward to enjoying this and surely in the next video I will get back with my feedback on the quality and the performance of the device I'll attach below the description there are possible links for getting it I got it from Aliexpress everything these days I get again I get it from Raleigh and I get the best prices there but you of course could find something that could be worthwhile on eBay I did say see this there as well so for us or North American buyers eBay might be a better option maybe I did see this on Amazon as well you guys can save on shipping but not not me I'm not in North America so that's it guys thank you very much for your time do wait for my second video just blow in the comments do leave your feedback like the video hated the video you want me to improve my setup talk about other things in a video just let me know okay and you can post down your questions I will surely address them and I'll also give you feedback on how it really performs so thank you very much have a great day"

I backed the R3 campaign through Kickstarter and it was well worth the wait!  Everything about the R3 is high-quality, and looks, feels, and operates like a device costing well above its asking price.  Stay tuned for an upcoming review video comparing the R3 to the R6.",28,3657,6.0,37.0,5.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W3UWfEaLMFI/hqdefault.jpg,HiBy|High

10:14:20.303178, greetings zombie nation thank you so much for tuning in and joining me for another unboxing from hi-bye this is the newly released r3 high-res digital audio player I was one of the Kickstarter backers for their campaign and received some pretty sweet goodies along with it including this awesome little carry pouch and a frosted clear hardshell case hi-bye had initially released the r6 through their IndieGoGo campaign and I backed that and did a unboxing video for that as well put a link right here you should definitely check it out and right off the heels of that they released the r3 via Kickstarter and I definitely wanted to pick that up as well the r6 uses a dual DAC whereas the r3 uses a single ninety 28 Q sabre chip it still has some super awesome features such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth which is also optics supported so you can take advantage of that higher res Bluetooth output high by definitely does not cheap out on their packaging details as you can see it is understated but very classy everything is presented very nicely and in some really cool little compartments that remind me of old-school Apple as you can see the first thing that greets you is the r3 unit itself and just like the are sakes it's got this cool little overlay of all of the buttons and inputs so you know exactly what is what and once again hob I went ahead and pre-installed a tempered glass front screen protector as well as a flexible rear back plate protector which is fantastic so that takes the hassle out of that as you can see on the bottom it's got a USB C charging port which is fantastic and a single micro SD card slot pretty standard you the button up and down for the volumes the buttons feel quite nice too on the other side you've got the power the track skip the track everyone and the play/pause button up top you've got the three and a half headphone jack as well as a 2.5 balanced so you can run balance through it which is pretty sweet and I love the awesome little glossy black high by Baxter green the r3 feels fantastic in the hand I initially wanted it because when I purchased the r6 my intentions were to kind of use that as a home rig and the r3 more for like traveling to take to work and go out and about you can throw it in the pocket and the weight is just non-existent alright digging in a little further under the top flap you'll see how I threw in another white hard shell protective case definitely not a fan of the white one I like the clear because you can see more of the unit itself I wish that they had supplied a soft silicone case like they threw and with the r6 but hopefully that will be available to purchase separately as the r3 kind of gets more out into the world nonetheless the case is super cool and it protects it in everyday use alright inside this nifty little box hive I threw in a high by branded USB C charging cable it's definitely not as nice or premium as the cable that came with the r6 but that also reflects the price point difference between the two models I do want to quickly say that one of the coolest features about the r6 and it happened to be the model that I chose to purchase was the fact that you can get it in a stainless steel body which is fantastic and I really wish that they had offered that option on the r3 I mean I understand that the lower weight is definitely a plus but man can you imagine having this little thing made out of stainless steel would be fantastic all right anyway inside the main little hi-bye box you basically get a rundown of that little overlay that was on the screen kind of telling you what the ports are etc etc anytime you get printed literature with a product in this day and age I think it's a big plus really cool high res audio sticker sheet I don't know how I guess they give you the option you can slap it anywhere you want which is awesome and then you get this sweet little certificate of whatever possibility as well as an extra tempered glass and a flexible screen protector for the front and back which is another awesome big plus thank you hi bye thus concludes the unboxing of the new high by our three high res audio player hope you enjoyed checking out the video definitely recommend picking one up I will be doing a review comparison between the two models so please be sure to stay tuned in the near future to check that out as you can see here is a quick size comparison between the r6 and the r3 I love both each for their own reasons and I'm very excited to share my thoughts about them with you if you enjoyed watching this

225,YakcEg9xen4,The Specialist,UCjDRpLebUTzvzk_UA6VzOrQ,Sony ZX2 Hi Res Audio Player vs Sony Walkman Review,Sony ZX2 Hi Res Audio Review with Sony Walkmans,27,3577,7.0,18.0,11.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YakcEg9xen4/hqdefault.jpg,Hi Res Audio|Sony ZX2|Walkman|ZX2,2020-10-07 10:14:20.303208, everyone today I'm going to show you a demo of the Sony's ethics to walkman before we get to that x2 I would like you to rewind the clock and in fact I'll rewind the clock and I'll show you how Sony have now progressed almost to the point where they are right now showing and is it x2 so nothing well today so I thought I would just do a videos sitting at home so let's get down to it first of all and we look at those ethics too which is here it's a fair bit of money to spend to be honest or so most of my thousand pounds so inside the box and you open it up nothing you don't get anything a piece of paper normal instructions you get a leather case you get one of these pieces as it x2 and and that's pretty much then you get a cleaning cloth with it and this is it so you just spent a thousand pounds you've got an empty box it's got absolutely zero nothing no headphones you just till I get a power lead with it which it here you get no docking station you get nothing at all just this power lead to charge it and start listening to it given the fact that is gold-plated gold inside and everything but Sony don't give you anything else other than those it x2 now what I want to show you right now is if you look at this logo here some of you may not understand what that is is actually a trademark for walkman which actually it says if you look read carefully right below it it says there walkman at the bottom of it right now this logo is you can actually see here originates from going back in time in the 1918 1990s here this is the Walkman which is effectively I guess I play and if you see something similar to my similar there are about the same look another Walkman there it is again see if you see their Walkman says it there is nice also on the Sony discipline discipline it was used to be a disc player not me just pass re open that up and this is the same thing there so basically Sony have a trademark and they call it hope anything which is a portable audio player is known as a Walkman for them which is fine now the reason why I'm showing you this is this is desert x2 beautiful device and total waste designed of course but now that I want to go back to what Sony initially intended Walkman was designed for Walkman or them portable because they play a report with audio player coming back from the 80s 90s and 2000 onwards and what they allow you to do listen to audio tapes while this devices in your pocket and you can listen to it using a remote and there it is so it's an inline remote and your headphones will then be plugged into this here and your earphones are here so you insert these in your ears this clips on to anywhere outside and your shirt sleeve wherever and let's remain in your pocket he also has a whole button you stop these buttons from being pressed and you can control everything your remote so effectively you don't take desire your pocket stays in so you can change the songs whatever without taking this out so if you're on a bus you're in a car you're walking jogging whatever you don't need to take this out he always stays with you because it's you know the beauty of listening music is you don't want to take it out but as it stands and these were the old audio players now if you look at another one this is a Japanese model same thing cassette player here an audio tape here's the over here to close it and where you go you can hear the whole button is up there because they designed a flip now what this falls are same again you listen to this you have set this in there and again you have remote again by Sony as you can see so and you play it so you can read play this I don't know if you can read this says play on it right that would play that so effectively once again you can keep this in your pocket and you can listen to it and do whatever you like this is Sony now what Sony now I've made after the years and years of years of development is always things going to get these used to be the analog players which is still are the best of its kind no matter what you say these are the best players out there still today to take if you want to record something call from CD and door cassette and the quality here you cannot match the quality its best as long as you use a metal get set them as metal cassettes were the best at the time when they were released because all yarrow always been an issue since the Winans have come out that everybody was running after quality to get the best true quality out apart from using a vinyl how you can use an audio compact audio player that would give you the most amount of time most amount songs and you can listen to it so here we are Sony of now 2015 2016 they have now made Sony ZX now what I've asked Sony that where is where all the headphones in this I've spent a thousand bells on this device and there are no headphones so I have to now go and spend another three hundred pounds which I've invested again into Sony's best topknot earphones which are the xba I P force as you can see for driver headphone for earphones I say these are beautiful they do the job sound lovely makes you feel that you're there for once again you are spending a fair amount of money to get some audio to your ears and Sony are not helping the support on this device is useless the support for Sony is in Cairo in Egypt everyone you speak to your question about this device they don't really know much they all read scripts that all talk about reading what they see on the screen nobody has the device in the hands they don't they haven't been given a device to play with so the only player knows about device is yourself so if you got a question you have to figure it out yourself write the device it sounds good there's all I can see from now is like having an Android Samsung s6 phone with you which allows you to just play audio and then when you go into the audio player Sony has their own customized player it's not the best they have dry too so you can see if you got various albums they will come up here but it's not the best those of you familiar with using a life ipod alive tuned you probably understand that that's little easier to navigate this thing is not the best to navigate yourself around I mean I for aged high res audio CD digital scene he might was asking to listen to and it sounds great but I had a few question that Sony is that why is it that I can't use this to chain my songs or if I want to use a cable to listen to my audio why is then like this for this I can then use this here and listen to my songs while this is in the case and just leave and I can just leave it in there and I can chain my songs so you say Leon made one the information from the sake that comes out it just as action I'd say this is just audio that's what it is nothing else there's no other information that comes out this jack so you can't is anything else they haven't made a headphone connector like this that you can use in here and it will give you more information and you can use a remote or some sort see how it made a wireless remote for it and nothing can use pretty much all you have is this device that you have to hold on to while you're listening to your songs or just let it play it's nice little device it's very well made but then again it's just a PCB in a metal casing here you would then understand once you start listening to it but it does great it really does this really good piece okay but the fact that you can't do anything else with it other than you can't install headphone jack and also if you obviously for example appears heater and you have another cable like this hanging around because cables the more devices and gadgets you buy the more cables you're going to have a sign you haven't made life any easier for anyone because you can see I've got two cables you they pretty much look the same right now if you have them things together would you know which one is which I don't think so so you try one that doesn't go in oh no honey Ellen reader oh yeah that's the one so you got use two cables they haven't made a uniform standard he uses bluetooth you probably already know and Wi-Fi to play songs if you listening to YouTube it's not this the best when it comes to organizing Souls you have to do a lot of work they have a software things called goes goes to do something you can download song on to that and then pass on to here also takes a memory card here which I already have used so if you put that in at 128 gig memory card clip Curtis that in begin and they already has 128 gig in tunnel memory takes on another hundred twenty-eight gig SD double the memory right if you want so whenever you insert the card it should but it would always pop this thing it's loading the moment hello this is just a normal Android leaving I think is background you can flip it through there's nothing unique about that other than it sells it's an audio player obviously you would expect that why they have managed to all the icons and all these things in it useless because you're buying is an audio player here we are we have an audio player he's doesn't have an it doesn't our remote till our wireless remote he can charge at the battery life he's alright Jose's the best 4000 bounds would expect a lot more to be honest personally these things over priced right she'll be in the region of 400 violins tops or they want to has about 850 or something is useless he's actually I mean people buying them because I was SD is that excitement of listening to higher as audio on the latest gadget it's hungry when you turn it on for the first time he says that it's got some capacitors that need to be warmed up something so you can wait for them to be warmed up it takes a good few hours other than that this is the Sony sixth it's made of metal alloy body a bit of leather at the back support is he is actually useless so if you ever buy one of these just make sure that some kind of warranty oh so close if you're hoping was funny to fix something you got no hope because they haven't got a clue are the talking I was from the founders only for ages in fact I asked them can somebody call me back to discuss you know about you know what the accessories are coming up his device I said they don't know nobody called me back so here I am making this video for all of you guys thinking of buying those ethics to think twice notes fortunately it's not worth it device is not with fast or anything it's non slow you know it's I mean how many times would you listen to an audio song in a portable device like them see for an example isn't an eyeball you always have this volume control on the remote in doesn't matter one of those you can't even use Sony's own earphones these are these they've got their own volume control and I can't use the volume control for the device just doesn't work fact I'll show you it also when you use you cannot let him here so you pull that out now if you're using bluetooth it doesn't matter if your jacket is in or out it does give power to the bluetooth so bluetooth you will use bluetooth as a primary device honest it would not give priority to this check so you have disabled bluetooth if you use one of those if you have a device paid for bluetooth it sounds great like I can say comes with his own leather case the leather case has cutouts to control the button obviously the case is nice is leaving jimmied up leather how long it's going to last tie water honey colored one-year warranty so once that's up you're pretty much carrying a thousand pound pocket gadget in your bulky that's just gonna wait to go down at some point you'll be stuck with it sony always charge your fortune to repair it because there is no extended warranty plan with Sony records to this device so you want it from Amazon Luiza Anjali's will give their own warranty obviously but the old benefactor try to give their own warranty Sony only 12 months that's it so here we have the sewing zx2 this comes up to yourselves you wish to buy our questions feel free to ask I mean there's also some talk about them eyeing a limit volume limiter so let's see what William limiter is there is some kind of a setting he has sailed here we go wall you name it fix little hunt off that's pretty much it so I was saying that there is two versions out one that has the limit and one that doesn't have the limit so I didn't know that Sony don't tell you that's tumors in the one version but it seems that there are different versions of floating in the market one which has got a limit which one doesn't mean there's a lot of audio configuration and setting our lighting in this I always pick a clear audio you can see and that just keeps the sound large nicely coming through the website that you have to use is Cuba's it's a very good website about high-res songs su-yong to download I response and go for account with Cuba's you can buy some nice songs if you like it does make the older sounds are nice I mean Bluetooth sound songs nice as well it is obviously ironware high-end product but they don't offer much to be honest with us so much for anion product especially when it comes to support very disappointed with this support for sony Sony have to say something I hope they do are looking at this video here the poor support is very poorly the people all the people are entire and all they do you look at the script every time you ask a question about the device they look asked they haven't got a clue a little you know what this is this thing is you don't even know you know what it does all they look at the do screen read the script come back to you talk to you about it that's it it will be nice over there specialist people oh yes by the way they have specialist people but they're not custom of hazing so I heard a lot of questions about the device initially anyway I got round and start using it so it's a shame it doesn't come with much information as in the Box the manual is always in zero everything is pointing to a website it's amazing it's a trial and error you're fine stuff yourself use it yourself and discover it yourself so need I want to tell you much and they don't want to even know if they're going to make things any better for this to ice me usually ones used to come out with walk like this there's always used to be like what's coming next some used to come with an earphone only so you didn't get your mode with it and come with remotes and used to be great I mean these are the longest-lived audio players 3he a cassette player right now is 2016 these were around I think probably early 80s indeed maybe if not before still the slim ones I'm talking about mother think once these limos are the latest technology Auto reverse changes a cassette around you don't need to take anything else and it plays and the sound is amazing and doesn't have any a pls no volume limiter anything at all it's just lasers ohms exactly other company it's brilliant even to this date highly recommend one of these he welcomes payout here's another one the view absolutely beautiful forget these devices I mean this is the olden days we'll all about how to build some quality product with pretty sound how to give the customer everything that comes with it and this is how they actually made everything they actually everything in this particular one has a mirror finish look at this he also plays television had a built-in TV tuner Rosie that up time and wrap TVs unit in a Walkman now the built-in radio beautiful absolutely beautiful you can detach this and one so you have also takes a slimline battery take it out the back yes coming back to zelich's to now the question that reminded me about talking about the battery is where is the battery in this well guess what it is like an IVA is inside all right les all right in a brawl at all fair on iphone there is a way to hope and he can replace the batteries fire well on this particular device do you send screws I don't mean it is waterproof no screws so how in the earth do you think if the battery is about to die fidget obviously will at some point you will start to see metric unit deviation on the charging so far zero last 30 hours and it allows you do 928 then it dropped turning at some point and then you as my walkman doesn't last long what I do with this he they're gonna sell it of hearing up Sony thing kind of based on the price of this product they'll charge Raleigh at least 200 please the battery if they can replace the battery because if they did is guaranteed to have some got on damage all they gotta do is replace the screen all together because this screen is gonna come based on what they're they work it's unlikely they're going to come back the same cognition the way you send it so I very little owe for this to ice future but it's a very short-lived two eyes one of those was only make a statement that they made something really nice and people want to use it that's it but the only way device that's going to last he has to be designed

quick review of the dude oh cool da 150 this is a really interesting wireless Bluetooth speaker because it claims to be high res audio certified it's a little stamp that you see embedded onto the surface of the fabric material off the speaker and it's the same certification you see on expensive HiFi mp3 players and it claims to have more detailed audio playback and resolution it's actually the first time I've seen a high res audio speaker typically they only come on audio players mp3 players things like that so I expect the sound quality here to be excellent the price point though is still very inexpensive you can actually find it on Amazon for under $40 which isn't bad at all and dude oh cool also sells a very budget oriented high res audio player as well that you can pair it with the entire package can be found for you know under $60 so if you are a audiophile and you want to get something really low-cost this could be something to take a look at alright so it has a fabric design that is very much in line with the design philosophy of new smart speakers like the Google home mini things like that you can see it is a stereo speaker with two three watt drivers and a battery capacity of 1200 milliamp hours which should get you around six hours of audio playback before you need to recharge it and it takes about two hours to completely charge up the packaging here very simple and just charges up using a micro USB well take a quick look at the speaker in a second down below here we have the instruction manual and on here there's also kind of a quick warranty guide this tells you how to pair it up what the various controls correspond to on the side compartment you have access to the charging cable and a optional auxilary cable as well and there's also an optional strap that you can attach so that you can hang it and easily take it with you when you're traveling or on the go but there is no auxiliary cable provided that 3.5 millimeter cable that you can plug directly into an audio device or into an mp3 player it supports this feature but you would have to supply your own I think this is kind of a strange omission because for high res audio and the best audio performance in general you do wired connection as opposed to Bluetooth just because when something is wireless it tends to lose a little bit of the detail of the sound so it seems to be kind of an interesting omission a strange omission in fact for a high res audio player but we shall see more about the bluetooth performance in a moment all right so the design of the speaker is actually fairly attractive again everything is made out of a cotton fabric both on the front and the back so it feels a very premium and well-constructed indeed we have the high res audio certification at the bottom here next to the dude oh cool logo and there's also tactile controls for changing the volume playing and pausing your music and answering and rejecting a phone call because there is a built-in microphone on the side here you have just a rubber construction two loops for the optional kind a strap soft touch rubber that prevents it from sliding around on a surface and on the back this is the passive radiator there is a USB port because you can use this as a power bank which is pretty cool to charge your phone and there's also the axillary port micro SD card slot ports if you have a SD card loaded with music it will play it back and also the charging port micro USB on/off switch none of these ports are covered up by rubber so this is not a waterproof speaker make sure you don't get it wet and you should be fine [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right so pausing the music there the audio sample actually sounds pretty clean and fairly impressive as I play and also pause the music you can hear that in between there is no static or Distortion the speaker is completely silent a lot of times on lower cost less expensive Bluetooth speakers so hear some music Digital interference so some humming or you know hissing in the background on here it actually sounds again very clean even at high volumes low volumes and pausing in between connection status also seems to be pretty good it uses Bluetooth version 4.2 and I got a range of roughly 30 feet or 10 meters in my testing otherwise the speaker packs definitely sufficient volume we were only about 70% in that test but it filled up the entire room without any problems so for smaller rooms for a car for taking it with you to share with a few people in more than suffices and it will definitely be no worlds better than any smart phone or laptop speaker base was also present as you heard in that kind of bass drop moment in the sample audio clip it's found on the back of the speaker you can definitely hear and kind of feel the table start to vibrate a little bit so it's good it's also not earth-shattering it could be a little bit more prominent if you are a bass head at the same time at PAX overall a fairly balanced sound I would say it does a great job in terms of mids and when it comes to highs it looses a little bit of the detail but overall really not that bad and certainly is one of the better sounding Bluetooth speakers I've tested at this really portable size so here is a iPhone 6s plus you can get an idea also the same size as C seven and eight about the same size as that on the front so a really portable unit when it comes to whether or not it justifies the high res audio kind of logo at the bottom I think that it's good it certainly it does sound very clean and it does give you a sufficient detail when you're listening to you know pop music electronic music in addition to watching movies it's also not going to be quite as you know it may be immersive or impressive sounding as high res audio certified earphones or you know connected to a high res audio mp3 player certainly is harder to really tell because on a Bluetooth speaker there are so many other variables first of all it's connected to the phone and then of course you should find a sample that is in high resolution if you're just playing back a regular YouTube clip you don't hear that huge difference with that being said as far as Bluetooth speakers go again it ready sounds quite good I found that when I plugged in a axillary cable so when using wired connection the sound quality did improve slightly I could hear a bit more details between the highs and the lows so for the best audio quality you could go there if you're playing back let's say classical music or something that requires a bit more careful listening but overall it does a great job in terms of volume and overall performance especially for the cost again I would say that to the Powerbank functionality also does work if you're in an emergency spot and you want to charge up your phone for a few minutes in addition the microphone on here also did a good job in our sample test calls however it isn't noise cancelling so if you're outdoors and there's wind or other people talking it struggles a little bit more at this price I think that this is a great value for a Bluetooth speaker overall I'm a fan of the look in addition to the sound although it isn't necessarily going to be the best speaker I've ever heard nor is it necessarily the the best Bluetooth speaker I've heard because I've tested larger units with bigger drivers a pack you know maybe more bass and sounded more impressive at the time there's something so small it does a good job the high res audio of course gives you really high expectations by default but then keep in mind that as a Bluetooth speaker you have to make sure that you the music you're playing back on the phone that you're using to play back the music is also kind of going to have to match that specification for you to get the full effect so thanks for watching this video here OS reviews this has been the dude oh cool da 150 wireless Bluetooth fabric speaker thanks for watching here at OS reviews

headphones which which take a lot of juice I think there's 35 ohm headphones it's not high impedance and there's enough juice here to listen at normal even somewhat loud listening volumes the controls are good this has not a touchscreen but a nice color screen that has a fairly useful interface lots of good stuff to gapless playback that's something Neil's polo player doesn't do it also has a 7 channel equalizer with presets and boy look at all the buttons friend up this not only is there an on/off button but volume up and down previous channel next track back and Settings button and the scroll wheel unlike the ipod actually Scrolls you can even hit the the big fat click wheel so in some ways there's actually a duplication of functionality but that's fine I find it very easy to use very easy to find what I want the screen displays album art in color also bitrate information I think this is well made this is a you know kind of a post iPod portable audio player I saved the best for last the final x1 is $100 $100 now that doesn't include storage in a way I kind of like this idea it uses microSD cards and you supply your own SD cards up to 128 gigabytes so I bought a SanDisk hunter 28 gig microSD card for 100 bucks so $200 total for storage and the BIOX one nice though you can have multiple SD cards one for your workout one for chilling you know and that's that's kind of cool certainly enough to store as big a music library as you'd want a hundred dollars for this so let me give you the pros and the cons but for that I think I need to retire to my relaxation zone after a workout it's so great to relax in the hot tub with your tunes and the x1 comes along with me thanks to that silicone wrapper it's not waterproof but at least it keeps splashes off of it and notice it's even powerful enough to drive these high impedance high five man HD 560 headphones at a reasonable level that's pretty sweet probably shouldn't wear those in the hot tub though let's take off the silicone wrapper and give you the pros and cons on the pius x one pro well it stands right out actually it's beautifully designed this is aluminum the functions are easy to use we're in the post ipod ER people pretty much understand how one of these is supposed to work I love the return of the click wheel it's kind of rubberized feels great the big button makes it very easy to use it doesn't have a hold button but when you press the on/off power switch if you turn off you don't see the screen but also the buttons become inactive so it doesn't really need a hold switch it I like the software I love the equalizer the gapless playback Dark Side of the Moon baby awesome and it's great that I can do both line out and headphone out one Jack the USB micro USB port means I can charge it with pretty much anything and that's both charging and data which is I so if you don't have a micro SD card reader don't don't worry you just plug it into your computer copy your files on to it 11 hours battery life and FiOS says they're gonna get to 15 with a firmware update that's more than enough for me on the cons there's only a cowl I left out the most important Pro the price a hundred bucks on the cons of course it does include headphones but for 100 bucks you have a little extra to buy some high-end fed phones you're not gonna want your Apple earbuds in this you need some good high fidelity in ear monitors to really get the most out of it it also doesn't include any memory but I think that's great it gives me the flexibility to buy one or more micro SD cards to fit my needs and with 128 gigs of storage and the player I'm still only paying $200 that's half the pono player okay maybe the fiyo x1 doesn't sound as good to those golden ears as the pono player I really can't tell it sounds great to me and it could play back all my files even the high res ones it's a definite buy for the fiyo x1 so I'm gonna chill out relax listen to some tunes and send it back to you father Robert you you you you you can tell them make it in here can you

Sylvania i he / very kindly sensing their HP one high-resolution audio player for review thank you very much I hear and I think this one also is going to be very useful with samplers and I'll show you that just a little bit further down in the video let's take a look and listen alright let's see what's in the box this is the unit there is a USB cable and finally the users manual alright he's a close-up of the unit on the top here we have the power button and a reset button there's a dial here 3.5 millimeter outputs a micro SD card in here USB port large display and three buttons and what is a high-resolution player well it's high resolution audio certified display is certified by the Japan audio Society for high resolution audio and basically can read high quality files typically you will listen to mp3s but this one allows you to play WAV FLAC AFF DSD and several other high-quality formats and this player comes with an eight gigabit card already inserted and it's got a playback time of 20 hours really long time let's turn it on there you go you got the settings here and then you can use the dial to move I'm sure there is an equaliser folder view category music settings place settings my favourite and he goes back to the equalizer another question is I'm sure what would you need something like this when everybody has something like this well this one has a high quality amplifier and this one doesn't necessarily have it so if you're primarily looking to hear music in really high quality this guy will be very helpful let's grab a pair of headphones and compare as far as usability the play is really easy to use there is a dial and then several menus so it's really easy to navigate and when you connect it to the computer automatically gets discovered as a drive and you can simply drag and drop your files to the player the player does come with three high quality pieces of music demonstrations so you can hear what he can do but of course you will want to load your own WAV or AIFF or flag files for this test is very simple I'm using a pair of really good headphones these are the biodynamic DT 990 these are hard happens to drive 250 ohms but they really sound good they are excellent for mixing they're they're flat so we will connect them both to the iPhone and to the HP one and do a comparison and for this comparison we're just using on one of my songs which is a close to meme I'm going to stream this one from the iPhone just like in a typical situation a user would so just connect the headphones to the iPhone and then I'll do exactly the same thing by playing close to me as a high quality file this came straight from the mastering so it's really high quality wave it's anything we'll just plug it in so yeah there is a quite a difference between the two files obviously one is compressed especially by mp3 YouTube and the other one is uncompressed and one thing you need to remember on the player there is an additional set as you get out of the factory it's set to level leveling so there is a set to increase the amp level from a zero to fourteen and if you set it to eleven twelve you can definitely drive the 250 ohm headphones so yes as far as quality having the full resolution file that you can listen to in headphones it's really good so for situations where you don't need the the smartphone you don't need the phone the apps your only your aim is only gonna be to listen to high-quality music yeah this is a really cool device especially since it's so small looking comparison to an iPhone access Mac's know if you can see the difference here but it's really tiny in comparison but there is one more ace up the sleeve of this little guy because I came up with an idea where you can use it with sampler let's take a look and so this is the way that I found that I can use they I hey / with sampler this is my trusty roll-on w-30 sampler you just connect the I hyper to the input of the sampler and I loaded banks of sound for the sampler in high quality resolution this is the bank a and if I press play you can send the whole stream to the sampling input and sample all of them and then all you need to do on the sampler is to use a tone copying function and chop each sample appropriately so I came up with a bunch of really cool sounds and so this is one way that you could use the paper hp1 for a music related project but yeah as a playback machine is really cool if you don't need the smartphone features which probably is not a bad idea these days to take a break from being always connected to the Internet and social media and just focus on listening to high-quality music again thanks to hyper for sending the player I hope you enjoyed the video I'll leave you with a quick techno song that I made using the high quality samples from the paper into the sampler thank you for watching as ever and I'll see you the next time [Music]

hello friends my name is Basim and I'm welcoming you for the hi-fi audio India review which I'm going to give you the review for this is the device for the day it is called Anki Oh gran Beach and the model name is DP - cm x 1 and it has a high resolution logo there and this is the beautiful device I will tell you about the design first of all because the design many people think that it is a little heavy first of all this is a previous model which is audio plate which is just an audio player is the similar model they are introduced but this time they added a smart phone such a functionality and that's why it got a little thicker because it has 2 Bowl one boat is for the smartphone thing like Snapdragon and other thing and the another Bowl is for completely for then for audio board which has 2 DAC and two amplifiers from suburb so they used it you can see this here but I'll show you your first thing you can see is here God oak is finally done as high-resolution audio and another one is it has a twin duct and tuned amplifier actually so and I really like the design it is a 5 inch 5 inch headset it's a 1080p resolution and it has a 16 megapixel camera rear camera and 8 megapixel the front one and it has it has 3gb ram 3gb RAM and 128 GB inbuilt storage Snapdragon 650 processor is used and 3000 mAh battery and also it supports fast charging so that is the specification so let's talk about the audio quality ok I have tested I have tested this smartphone with 2 headphones one is a Chinese brand this is called this is called DQ SM so dukale some has has a 2 balanced armature and one dynamic driver and it has the 3 filters which is based trouble and neutral so you can change it on the top here on the top here you can change it the filters so I have that in mind in this leather pouch ok and another one is also a Chinese band but it's a more popular brand and it is called one more one more one more high resolution quad driver in your headphone which I really liked it I mean ie this is very very small headphones very lightweight but the quality of this headphone I really liked it I mean it is the best after using so many headphones this one I think this is the best one so let's talk about the audio quality but before that I will tell you the the function or the smartphone function we have the regular function we have is there like going to the menos and application access camera and everything the regular thing is there but when you go to your audio player you can change the settings as per your listening experience or as per your taste so I will show you some of the functions which I like this is called digital filter which is really nice I mean I mean I liked it it has sharp slow and short I usually go for sharp one and you can set it in volume and the volume field in settings also but here you can also get after that it has up sampling mode up something more it can be adjust your maximum frequency from 96 100 and 384 kilo Hertz but 380 kilo Hertz is only for the USB 96 and 100 you can set it for for sure for those song which is not 96 or 192 like you are listening mp3 but you still want an audio audio quality of at least that kind of frequency so it it could upscale the frequency to that mode and and here is another absurd sampling mode on and off you can switch it off and switch it on okay like in the previous field I'll show you that you can set the frequency and you can switched off the frequency from here this is the function and there are so many other function which I did not use it but the good thing about volume knob is it is a good design and when you every time you increase the volume you will see on on although by you even you're watching video or you're talking to someone or anything I mean it will it will give you this color every time so okay it's a good thing I am thinking that it's not a smart phone and I cannot compare with any other smartphone because it's completely different hardware because it the main purpose of this smartphone is for listening music so I'll talk about the sound quality the sound quality I feel is really really nice I don't have much to compare in my mind I've used feos audio player in a past and Sony Walkman and LG v10 also used an LG be 30 I'm currently using it so after listening those devices I feel that the capability of this device is completely different it has more detail audio it comes with good sound sound stage and it comes with every small detail that you might not hear it in many of your players I'm not sure if you spend more money and you'll get more expensive one might get more than this quality but for me I was happy with the quality especially getting audio output from their 2.5 mm because you know that the 2.5 mm does not get you the get a problem like 3.5 in it doesn't mix up the signal so left sound is completely for the left and right sound is completely for right so that's the best thing about the smart phone and the battery life is very very nice I was surprised when I was using 4G same Jo same the in India we have 4G SIM India Gio which I can use it and it works really fine the rest of function the mobile function is really nice and I don't have any complain about it and the good thing is that the firmware update I'm getting it I'm still getting it there are two former update I still call it after purchasing this product I hope I will get more in future I'm not sure about this firmware update will update the OS or maybe in future but the regular problems bugs and all that they are fixing it like there was a due to issue going on and now it's fixed so this is my review for Onkyo Granby and I'm also selling this smartphone in India yr LX I'll put in description you can check it out there and if you have any question please let me know thank you and please like and share share my video and subscribe the channel thanks for watching

Prior to watching this video, please check out Lachlan’s critique of 24-bit audio. In it he distills the important bits about Hi-Res bits.Before we begin, let me be clear: there is nothing wrong with believing that Hi-Res audio sounds better, or that you get a better experience out of it. No, stair steps do not represent discrete sampled signals, and no, you won’t ever hear music at 120dB of dynamic range. But if you receive joy from listening to music recorded or mastered or merely upsampled into Hi-Res audio, good on you. 

Beyond theoretical benchmarks and personal anecdotes, there is no evidence that hi-res 24-bit audio delivers any audible benefit to the ear, especially at human-safe listening volumes. As a semi-objective reviewer, I call out audio gear that fails to perform up to its hi-res marketing promises. Largely, that is the purpose of the audio/data portion of this website. The latest dedicated audio device to fail is FiiO’s M6. The most famous to fail the test is Sony’s NW-ZX2…

10:14:20.303580, [Music] if listening to 24-bit audio makes you feel better or if a particular 24-bit remaster is verifiably better master than its 16-bit analog have at it but blanket claims that 2400 do is better than 6 to me audio are useless without first defining what you mean by better internet for up brim with bold claims praise and stupefyingly misleading recommendations as a semi objective reviewer a color audio gear that fails to perform up to its high res marketing largely that is a purpose of the audio data portion of my website the latest dedicated audio device to fail this is feos m6 the most famous to fail the test is Sony's nwz x2 the de-facto opinion is that 24-bit audio is better and that high res sounds better evidence for both assertions is for lack of a better descriptor mystical at best for my part I am sorry I have failed to consistently remind my followers at touch my apps or headphone you know pet phonics or mamaj head fight and now for Tucker lounge that on paper 24-bit audio delivers incredible performance but in actual use 24-bit music is restricted by too many external variables to be of much if any non marketing or post-production use consider your listening habits do you listen to music at low or high volumes do you listen to it in in quiet or loud environments and because Duds do exist through what equipment do you listen to it i'm an IM guy myself ultra sone great o noble fit ear and the like might be in my ears any day of the week when it cools down finally in tokyo all wear headphones something like an ES 10 or perhaps addition 8 or something like that but no matter the headphone I set my music to safe listening levels I do this because I'm a music lover and I want to keep my ears healthy enough to enjoy music for a long time still theoretical advantages of 24-bit audio over 16-bit audio are dynamic range noise stereo separation and distortion typically each of these is described in the logarithmic on a decibel scale in other words the louder the better files with higher bit depth may possess higher dynamic ranges this is completely dependent of course on how and where the original instruments were recorded and how well the recording signal is reproduced in playback theoretically a 44 killer 16-bit audio file can possess the diamond range of 96 decibels and a 45 kilohertz 24-bit audio file can possess the dynamic range of 133 in a perfect universe instruments reaching those values would be trivial [Music] but that's not our universe and we can't forget about noise introduced by the recording and mastering environments noise introduced by your your playback equipment and of course noise in your listening environment even in a perfect universe a true 16-bit audio experience would necessitate listening to music at at least 96 decibels a volume at which the Government of Canada will limit your daily maximum exposure to two hours after which it is thought to cause hearing loss dyed-in-the-wool 24-bit audio supporters would have to listen to sustained volume levels of theoretically perfect recordings louder than that notice any difference to Redbook 16-bit or they would have to listen to theoretically perfect recordings louder than a hundred and twenty decibels to notice a difference against the theoretical limits of dithered 16-bit audio at those levels you would lose your hearing in short order speaking of which to varying degrees hearing loss is a reality for most of us are we even capable of discerning 96 decibels of dynamic range to begin with our MAA is is useful in illustrating qualitatively objective differences from device to device at least against a bit limited to theoretical benchmark it won't tell you how a device sounds or even if you will like the sound of that device it does show how well a device conforms to the limits of a suite of theoretical test and therefore indicates potential output quality of a device or recording it's not pro it's not the best amateur thing around but it's easily available and results from RNA stuff are easily basically for the following RMA a results unmatched the below devices to the maximum volume at which I'm comfortable listening to effects twins selected ambient works 85 to 92 through an iPhone for it the headphones were a pair of audio technica es700 beam is particularly quiet I had to bump up volume more than I would normally on a newer recording on the iPhone 4s that volume was seven steps from maximum then using a calibration signal I matched the volumes of an iPhone 6 and a KJR M s a K 102 the same iphone4s level my ADC was a lynx helo after ensuring a mean output difference between all devices was no more than 0.5 decibels I tested the same 24-bit audio signal through each device let's check out the dynamic range of a 24-bit file when played back at comfortable listening levels does it crack the 16-bit ceiling [Music] when calibrated for normal listening levels not even the exemplary MS a K 100 comes close to hitting the 16-bit ceiling it's also interesting to note that no device gains a definitive upper hand across the board this is in spite of massive differences between the devices weren't tested at maximum volumes [Music] unlike recorded music whose loudness and dynamic range vary with the passage our MAA tests only for theoretical upper limits of sampling frequency and bit depth at which the signal was recorded at normal listening levels my target 24-bit audio file called target 2444 whose potential dynamic range is 133 dropped to a tested maximum of 90 point 5 decibels this is far below the 96 decibels theoretical dynamic range limit of 16-bit even in a perfect world where perfect instruments were recorded in a vacuum by exemplary hardware and then played back through equally perfect devices 24-bit audio would still have to be enjoyed at volume levels way beyond my threshold for pain and I imagine yours this of course raises the following question with ears ringing could I or anyone for that matter distinguish the difference between 16-bit and 24-bit audio 24-bit audio is a wonderful tool whose theoretical limits push the development of better and better playback and recording equipment but as far as I see it it offers no real-world benefits to the listener beyond what placebo transcribes our brains are wired to believe narratives it's part of our evolution but willing patterns of self-deception can be problematic in mundane Juris suffice it to say your favorite 24-bit music isn't a record of the theoretical limits of the format and it won't be listened to at volumes which demonstrate those limits if played back at normal listening levels 24-bit audio cannot go beyond or even close to 16-bit ceiling what are the actual advantages of 24-bit audio over 16-bit I reckon they're basically none now there is the chance that a high res file will be better recorded than it's lower 16-bit raised original or the original album that came out that was then remastered that's possible and in that case that thing probably does sound better but at the same time a 16-bit remaster of the same should sound just as good through the same playback device at the volumes you normally listen to music finally of particular note high res audio players playing back audio at comfortable listening levels offer no demonstrate benefit against a good smartphone at least on a test bench let's just say they don't offer technically better sound quality do they sound better to you they may I tend to prefer a good high-pass filter which most smartphones lack at least at the DAC level so there is that but then again there's bound to be an app that just about approximates that experience thank you guys for watching another video if you

Listening to Hi-Res music allows you to pick up on the subtle details and nuances that you would hear in a recording studio.
This video helps you to understand what is different and how it enhances listening experience.

Sony High-Resolution Audio products let you hear music as the artist intended.
http://www.sony.net/Hi-Res",28,2553,3.0,74.0,0.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CHXoMIsOgaA/hqdefault.jpg,yt:cc=on|Hi-Res audio|Hi-res music|High quality sound|Premium sound|As the artist intented|ハイレゾ|HiFi music|HQ-FLAC|audiophiles|sound engineer|Technics,2020-10-07 10:14:20.303624," Anyone who has ripped a CD to an MP3 file and compared the difference will know that the music loses something in the process - a liveliness and realism that makes it much more enjoyable to listen to. Music producers and artists have long been aware of this, so they capture their recordings at the highest quality possible - in most cases, a quality that makes even CD sound flat and lifeless in comparison. But until recently, these master recordings were simply not available for the average listener to enjoy. But, as music-lovers ourselves, Sony created High-Resolution Audio products to give you that next best thing, next to being right there in the studio or live venue with your favourite musicians. So, if you're a music lover, the simple fact is you'll love High Resolution Audio. But in this video, I want to drill into you some of the fundamentals of sound to help you better understand why high resolution is such an important innovation and how we got to this point in the history of audio recording. Stick around - it's a fascinating subject. Music, like all audio, is vibrations in the air. An instrument, or speaker, creates high or low-speed vibrations which our ears capture and translate into a huge range of pitches and tones. At its most simple, a fast vibration, or high frequency, creates a high pitch, while a lower frequency one will produce a lower pitch. Other characteristics such as the shape and energy of these soundwave vibrations then determine the type and volume of the sound. Capturing and storing this audio for later playback has come in a variety of forms over the years, but it can broadly be broken up into three types: analogue, digital, and digitally compressed. Despite being less convenient than digital formats, a good analogue audio recording is valued even today for its natural, realistic sound. Analogue recordings, whether on magnetic tape, record, or even wax cylinders, capture and reproduce the sound vibrations directly. The needle on a record player is literally bumping along microscopic grooves, and those tiny vibrations are simply amplified into the electrical signals that drive your speakers. It's a good system, with few steps between the audio being captured and being reproduced. But it requires physical and sometimes fragile objects for storage - not ideal for the large music collections we all have now. A digital recording starts the same way as an analogue one, with capturing those vibrations, but these soundwaves are then converted to a series of coordinates. When a digital audio file is played back, those coordinates are used to reconstruct the soundwave back to an analogue signal which your speakers or headphones can recognise, and reproduce. All things being equal, the quality of a digital audio recording is determined by two things - the sampling frequency, which is how many of these coordinates are captured per second. And the bitrate, which is how accurate each of these coordinates is relative to the original audio signal. When the CD was developed by Sony and Philips, a lot of thought went into what specifications would allow it to deliver a good listening experience while being reasonably practical to use. The result was a sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz, or just over 44,000 samples per second, each captured at a bit rate of 16 bits, which determines how precise the height, or energy, of that coordinate is. Together, these two things determine the frequency range, or the range of pitches from low to high, and the dynamic range - the volume from soft to loud - a recording can contain. That 44.1 kHz sample rate gives us a range of reproducible frequencies of around 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz - roughly the capability of human hearing. And the 16 bit bitrate results in a dynamic range of 96 dB, easily enough to reproduce a live orchestra from solo piccolo to full noise. So, the CD remains a good format, but its physical dimensions and the inability to stream or download means it has been rapidly replaced by new compressed file formats. With much smaller file sizes and no physical size, compressed audio formats like MP3 or AAC are the way most people enjoy music now - whether via streaming services or from files stored on your device. A compressed audio file offers unmatched convenience. A good way to think about compressed music files is by considering a drawing on a piece of paper. If you fold up the paper you can fit it in your pocket but, once you've done that, it's impossible to fully restore it to its original state. How small the file is, is determined by the data rate. It's common for streaming services to offer audio at around 120-300 kbps, and most tracks you purchase and download are around 250 kbps. That's about 1/5th the file size of a digital track on a CD. Of course, not all digital file formats are the same either, so a modern AAC file sounds better than an older MP3 file even if it's the same file size. Think of it as more careful folding. We now understand that most digital music starts out sounding pretty good - at CD quality or better - but it is then compressed so that you can stream it on your smartphone or download it quickly to your computer. The real question then is what you're missing out on, and should you care? So here's uncompressed music... and a typical compressed stream. In that short sample, probably playing through your basic speakers or headphones, you might not hear much difference, but this is what you're missing out on... While compressing audio doesn't change the basic sound of a music track much, it does change how you feel about it. The more detail is contained in a music track, the more real it sounds, and the greater your emotional response to it. We've all been moved by music at some point - it's a powerful tool used by film makers, retailers, even call centres - so delivering all that detail to your ears quite literally changes how much you enjoy it. And that brings us back to High Resolution Audio. High Resolution Audio goes beyond even CD quality - offering higher sampling frequencies and bitrates. It's like using that really nice glossy photo paper for your picture, instead of regular printer paper. The use of higher bitrates like 24 bits rather than CD's 16 bits means you have more dynamic range, so you can accurately capture the tiniest subtleties - like the tap of a pianists fingernails across the keyboard, or the subtle break in a singer's voice - as well as all the impact of a drum solo. And all without compromise. The higher sampling frequency of perhaps 192 kHz, 5x that of CD quality, means a much wider frequency range is captured and reproduced. When matched with an appropriate amplifier and speakers or headphones, audio frequencies greater than 20kHz are reproduced, including ultra-high frequency harmonics - the subtle components of a sound which help to give especially acoustic instruments their character. We all know the experience of sitting in the audience for a live performance, and we know the experience is not the same as listening to a CD recording of it later. High Resolution Audio isn't just about hearing a difference, it's about experiencing a difference - the music may be the same, but the feeling and presence that the music conveys is what changes. We're lucky that recording engineers have known all this for years, so they've already captured audio in their studios at the highest resolution available to them. What Sony is offering with High Resolution Audio products is to reproduce that audio in your home, or headphones, exactly as your favourite artist and record producer intended you to. And a music lover couldn't ask for more than that!"

quality,2020-10-07 10:14:20.303647, hi this is Mike from Mike's unboxing reviews in how to and today we're going to look at a selection of dax from shark in keep watching to find out more okay so in today's video we're gonna look at some audio dax from the company shark hoon now these have been sent to me free of charge for review purposes and that is no way gonna influence my recommendations or otherwise so let's go through the three that we've got so first of all we've got the mobile dak PD now the mobile tank PD is designed really for plug into USB type-c devices but you can of course use adaptors if you wish to but this one really is designed for your kind of Android devices you can plug in a trrs headset into the jack plug and then you can still actually power it so you can get power delivery up to 60 watts through the USB type-c port so if you want these people that likes using headphones whilst your phone is charging this is gonna be absolutely perfect for you so essentially all three of these do the same kind of thing they're all supportive of the high res audio standard and they are accredited or certified by the Japanese audio Society so these are very good quality devices indeed but fortunately that isn't reflected in the prices and the prices please very very cost effective now for what is effectively a USB soundcard or standalone sign card these are very very good prices so the PD version you're looking anywhere between 15 20 pounds depending where your purchase in the standard version just a mobile back anywhere between 10 to 15 pounds and the as its named DAC in play the gaming DAC pro s anywhere between 35 to 40 pounds again depending on where you're shopping and what time of year is etc etc the prices may change I will put some affiliate links in the description below so you can check mate for yourselves and me you've gone up slightly may have gone down slightly if they do or try and reflect that in the video notes but essentially that is the price you're looking at paying so this version the gaming DAC pro s this is designed more for your PC gamers of course you can still use it with an adapter OTG adapter that kind of thing with Android devices no problems at all there but this is the one really aimed gamers this is one I'm currently using at the moment which is attached to my laptop I'm using it in conjunction with some creative pedal speakers which are relatively cost effective speakers around about 15-20 pounds or so a 2.0 setup no subwoofer just two desktops beakers plugged in via USB so they don't get the greatest of power but surprisingly by just using this simple USB device on the end of the input cable just plug I into there plug it into your laptop and you are ready to go that is it couldn't be simpler all the drivers are self contained within windows such as a matter of finding some music and playing it now one thing you will notice with this straightaway is the amplification the amplification is literally off the chart is insane with the windows volume set to run about 30 with the headphones plugged into them a headphone jack on the side of the laptop listen away to some music no problems at all plug this in on the same volume and I almost scared myself to death it is insanely amplified so I had to turn it down to around about sort of 6 or 7 just to be kind of at the same volume level so that give you some idea of the amplification I would say well I would say it's probably four times as loud as standard so there's a serious serious amount of amplification which is not so noticeable for use empowered speakers but if you're using something like some in-ear monitors like these are from status these are status in-ear monitors these aren't amplified in any way shape or form they're literally just headphones they plug in but the difference on these is absolutely phenomenal I cannot stress enough how much of a difference it makes and I would strongly suggest if you're in any way unsure of how good these actually are order them from Amazon try them out for yourself see what you think of them and I'll be amazed if you find them to be any different from what I've said obviously with Amazon you've got a 30-day returns so if you don't like them you can send them back but I'm pretty sure for the money and for the performance you get of them you're going to be keeping hold of them and it's gonna be something that you can easily slip into your coat pocket it's your jacket or whatever it is Keeley's with you at all times just to make sure that when you are listening to music you're gonna get the best quality same though going back to the best quality sound these all support high res audio so these will do 96k no problems at all again depending on your audio source and what's plugged into it may drop down a little bit they have actually got built-in hardware equalizers as well this is more so for the mobile versions rather than the USB but they've got built-in equalizers as well so you can choose between a kind of like a bass heavy profile high-end bass and travel or flat profile or just like a vocal profile all of which you can do just from the press of a button which is really super simple to do and there's three steps the fourth step goes back to the flat profile so really super easy to use so that's probably enough for me waffling all about it the real proof of the put in is obviously going to be in the list into it so one going through now is I'm gonna play the music from the YouTube audio library the moment I can play with the charr kun game in DAC plugged in so you can get a good listen to what it's like then I'm gonna unplug the speaker's plug them back in and then I'll let you be the decider okay so the first one we're gonna try is this is just from the audio library this is a track called dwarf star [Music] so listen very carefully I'm gonna unplug this now no software so you got remember what this sounds like [Music] so I'm gonna pause it there and initially I don't want to influence your decisions and obviously I haven't heard what this is locally I'm added to the video yet this is as I'm recording it but from my ears definitely there was a big increase in the kind of the range of the audio come out the frequencies etc it was definitely slightly louder as well I'm pretty sure that has the case on what do you think careful a bit later caps not in definitely a bit later the same stage is definitely wider and that is the whole point that this this device is designed to increase your same stage to give you more depth to give you more resolution in your audio and also if you're using headphones or non powered devices it's designed to boost up quite a considerable amount even with these pair of speakers which are getting their own amplification it still gives it that little boost as well just to give you that little bit more out of your audio which are getting for the price of it is fantastic if you were to get a PCI Express or if you're crazy enough to get a PCI sign card these days maybe even a USB one you're going to be looking at considerably more money than this for that kind of setup creative labs all the G same glass for those kinds of things you're going to be spending more money than this so this is super convenient super easy to store we don't even have to take your PC apart and obviously if you've got a laptop it's difficult to put sign card in so you just plug this in and you can take it with you anywhere so hopefully you've you'll agree with me that it sounds really good and we try a couple more tracks now just so you get an idea of what the same quality is actually like [Music] Sly's without attack [Music] yes okay so I think that definitely proves it that there is definitely a much wider same stage there hopefully it's come through on the microphone unfortunately wearing a loud mic so you probably aren't getting this as as good as I'm getting it but it certainly does seem pretty good and it's definitely later the same stage is far improved and it's definitely later so that is the game in back Pro now this has got a slight sound to noise ratio of a hundred DB which is pretty decent the specs are actually on the box we'll do some close-ups of the boxes so you can see what the deal is also again I'll put some links in the description so you can go to shocking site and you can check it out for yourself so that is the that that can play version the instant upgrade for your audio just take a look at the mobile versions now these are designed really for kind of like your normal headphones in your monitors that kind of thing now I've actually tried this with a set of Apple headphones and various other ones and it works exactly the same way this is very very simple all you get is a adapter cable effectively so this can plug it into your Android devices or other devices with a compatible adapter and again this is the sort of thing that you can keep with you all the time it's a very simple compact device so as it says high res audio on the back of this one there is actually an EQ button so all we do is press the EQ button and there's a very very light click there and you can cycle through the hardware EQ modes in there which is really nice feature so you don't have to worry about going into your phone and changing setting so if you like a more bassy Sanremo headset then just press the button it's easy to do so let's treat all we do is that plug that into your fan and your weight off to the races now here's my Android phone so we'll plug in so you get an idea I did actually do a video on how to enable USB audio on Android devices if you want to check out you can check out from the link up here I'll show you how easy it is to do but that is pretty much it so as long as you've got a USB type-c device you can plug this in so whether PC a phone all sorts of Android devices you name it you can pretty much plug it into it Apple devices I'm not entirely sure off again you can check that in the links and they'll give you if there's I'm pretty sure that this C Mac OS I'll update that if there is a if I'm wrong on that I'll let you know in the comment section but I'm pretty sure this works with Mac OS as well so as Android Windows and Mac OS I'm pretty sure and Linux I believe as well okay I'll put links in the description and clarify that anyway so that is the the standard edition thus the mobile back the game essentially it's a USBC sine card with equalizer headphone amplifier and trrs microphone input so actually that's something I didn't mention with your earphones if you've got ones with they've got control buttons on for like play balls volume up and down those features still work so it passes through goes through into the USB see and still works on your device so if you are if you want these people you likes to keep your device hidden and you want to be able to fast forward for your tracks or adjust the volume or playing pools if someone's trying to talk to you you can still do all that stuff using this adapter so that is the mobile back I sub look at the mobile back PD now essentially this is the same kind of deal USB see sign card which the game works with most supported operating systems this one's a little bit simpler again a little bit more convenient possibly so King USB type-c connection you've got a EQ button on the top so nice little clicky button for you to change through your various EQ presets and we do is plug in your TRS microphone it sort headphone or headset suppose it would because it's my claim an ear things anyway I'm digressing so you plug that in and then that gives you a pass through so you can still plug in your USB type-c charger straight into there so you can get up to 60 watts of power delivery through that connection and yes double checking it is sixty watts so again similar sort that deal so is say external sign card USB type-c hardware equalizer with three presets as we discussed before the output voltage if for those who that are interested is 1 volt the impedance is between 16 to 250 owned maximum power is a hundred milliwatts signal-to-noise ratio as is with the rest of the range is a hundred DB and total harmonic distortion which may be appropriate to some of you is zero point zero zero three percent so that is pretty low and it says the sampling frequency is 24-bit 96k low hertz so there's the specs for again the specs are very similar across all of them there might be very many differences I believe that that can play actually the output voltage was two volts before I remember rightly I can't see on there I'm sure it is on the website but yes so that has got the higher output but all of them do boost so they will give your audio a lift especially on your Android devices which have gotten Ettore asleep poor headset outputs so use one of these and you'll get a boost in your audio so that is pretty much it for this kind of unboxing and quick overview of the shocking Mobile tax and the gaming DAC pro from me personally in the game of that pro is probably well I'm gonna use most because I'm mostly windows-based and on a laptop PC whatever you these days is really off very rare that I actually get to listen to music on my phone so maybe you will give those way to some lucky subscribers keep watching the videos and what are saturday night live streams to find out if that is going to be a thing so I've been Mike this is my unboxing reviews in how to and hopefully we catch you in the very next video or saturday night live stream thanks for watching

convention in New York this past November 2015 and then repeated with some additional materials to the Chicago section of the Audio Engineering Society on November 24th 2015 so here is an outline of what I'm going to cover I'm going to start with my motivation for doing this work I'd like to spend some time discussing the consumer electronics industry and the virtues of high resolution audio that they have been promoting I would then like to present the central theme of this presentation which is a different approach to the perception issues I'm going you´d into the details of the elements of my study I'm going to talk about the specifics of the judgment techniques I'm going to cover creating and validating the tests that I've developed that I'll spend a little time discussing some of the individual testing comments that have been obtained after that we're going to give you enough information so if you wish you can build your own test system this will include the the hardware and links to the software downloads that I the test files that I talked about and finally we're going to cover some other factors I still believe are open questions that are critical to this particular issue and we'll do a summary following that so - my motivation high-resolution audience become a topic of much interest due primarily to the availability of audio equipment and recordings that have performance attributes that are beyond the established CD often called the Redbook CD which touts a twenty to twenty kilohertz bandwidth and a 90 DB signal-to-noise ratio so a question that's often raised is are there benefits to be gained with higher resolution audio the benefits most commonly expressed are those of a wider frequency response and a greater dynamic range such as how much is needed and how much can we perceive but there are other perception factors to consider which we will get into let's look now at the consumer electronics industry and what it has been doing to promote high resolution audio this has been a subject that started several years ago at the Consumer Electronics Show which one mate might argue was an effort to sell more versions of the same song but with higher technical quality and that it would also motivate people to buy better technical equipment as well as the better recordings now the RIAA created a new logo and a definition for what is a high-resolution recording and they said it's a digital audio program with the sampling rate greater than 44 point one kilohertz and a word length greater than twenty bits and as you can see this is the logo that they came up with prior to that the Japan audio Society has created a logo to be associated with hardware supporting higher word lengths and greater sampling frequencies and that included 40 kilohertz for amplifiers microphones loudspeakers headphones and 96 kilohertz 24-bit or greater for recording and playback equipment this is the logo that they came up with you tend to see both of these nowadays on different types of products so the degree of audible improvement attributed to these two parameters has been widely discussed and debated but people seem to want definitive answers I've chosen to take a different approach to the issues rather than attempt one more definitive study to find yes or no answers to these questions I focused on a new approach that I believe to be of more value to the creators of consumer and digital audio entertainment the focus has been to develop a number of easy to take tests that will allow individuals using their own or recommended electro acoustical equipment to obtain some answers for themselves consideration is given to individual hearing capabilities and listening environments as part of making these assessments let's look at the elements of my study I've chosen to break the audible performance attributes of digital audio recording and playback systems into three parts the first part deals with dynamic range which is related to the word length of digital signals and that judgment is involved with one test that I will present number two deals with frequency response which relates to the sampling frequency and these judgments result in two tests and three other tests dealing with audible in band artifacts of meeting artifacts that are within the normal audible band twenty to twenty kilohertz associated with the design and performance of the necessary anti-aliasing filters anti imaging filters and clocking schemes use in such system this presentation however covers work on parts 1 &amp; 2 with a bit of speculation on part 3 let's start with some of the specifics of the judgment techniques and let's look at some of the necessary equipment for making judgments here we see on the left that one needs some program material that represents what is considered high resolution audio files and these would be files in this case that have a 96 kilohertz sampling rate and 24-bit word lengths and this will allow us to explore frequencies up to 40 kilohertz and I dynamic range of 90 to 100 DB these will be played back on a device that's capable of storing them and playing them back properly and then we're going to feed that to an amplification device which has the necessary dynamic range and bandwidth to handle the signals and from there we're going to split our playback into two areas ones going to involve some loudspeakers the other is going to involve some headphones and these also will have to be quantified regarding their capabilities and finally most importantly there is the listener that's you and the listening environment that you're in so the combination of that and your hearing acuity are going to be all put into play on making some meaningful test judgments let's start now with the dynamic range judgement this rather complicated figure is the key or heart of the dynamic range test I chose to use music as the test because it has high face value and the logic is something like this I start with a short excerpt about 20 seconds of a musical track played it what we call reference level that's a level you set to be as loud as you wish which would set your loud level that's followed by a repeat for the same period of time at an attenuated level which in this particular graphic is 15 DB lower and then following that is a repeat of the reference level again the playback is best we feel I feel through earphones and so we're playing back from a player we're listening with earphones and your task is to decide can I hear the lower level signal and then if you look to the left you'll see that the different tracks 1 through 19 involve that attenuated sample being dropped progressively in 5 DB steps so your task is to decide when you can't hear it in the attenuated form and that's going to give you a number which will be representative of your own dynamic range sensitivity along with the equipment that was used and of course your hearing acuity here's an example of what a 15 DB dynamic range test might sound like so first you will hear the 20 seconds or so of the program material and then you'll hear it reduce by 15 DB and then it will repeat at the normal level again once it took the monkey far ride in the air the market thought that everything was on the square once it took the monkey far ride in the air the monkey thought everything was on square next we're going to turn our attention to frequency range judgments before we continue here is some background material that I think will be helpful in understanding the perception of frequency response most everybody has experienced the so-called audiometric test which produces a audiogram the audiogram is shown on the right the test subject is in a booth the operator is outside the booth controlling what's called an audio meter and usually this test is a pure tone audiometry test in which tones are played at different levels to the test subject the test subject responds when they can or can't hear the tone and then based on this a plot is made of the minimum level heard or hear a ball at these different frequencies in this case up to 8000 Hertz the red and blue represent right and left ear so it's somewhat of an upside-down looking graph and to interpret it we can look say at a severe hearing loss situation where the hearing level in decibels has to be 70 DB which is noticeably higher than for a normal hearing person which is in the range of 0 to 20 DB and this is above the hearing threshold looking further into the testing of hearing acuity various researchers have done work on these hearing thresholds for tones above 8 kilohertz which gets into the the range and concerns of the high-resolution audio discussion and as we can see in this case we have a listener sound source we're looking at the left-hand picture at different angles at each year or in front and what is going on here is pretty much the same thing a known sound pressure level is generated where the user's head would be and the user reports back on what they hear and as one might expect the levels have to be made higher and higher and higher as the frequencies go up and up so the graph we see on the right is sort of the inverse of the audiogram which you've seen and here you can see that a young listener for example would have let's say a 0 DB sound level for perception at about 4 kilohertz but when you get up to 20 kilohertz it would have to be as high as 90 or 100 DB and at some points there is no audibility so this shows that for most all people that as the frequency goes up the threshold of hearing has to be raised in order for a perception to occur now the problem with this is it doesn't tell you really much it just tells you that as the frequency goes up we don't hear as well some people are better some people are worse so I'm looking at what I'm looking to do is to find a test that is more meaningful on an individual basis so this has led to a new group of frequency range tests the first of these tests which I'm calling test 2 is a bandwidth test and it uses high-pass filters what do we mean by that we mean that we're going to take a sound that we have graphed in the middle upper picture and we're going to provide the full bandwidth which is the blue and then we're going to inject a high-pass filter in which we give you less and less of the low frequency content and that filter can be stepped up in one kilohertz increments all the way to 30 kilohertz now the signal that I've chosen to use which the graph shows is that of a recording of a chime a percussion chime that you've often seen as part of a drum kit and that's been recorded as I will describe in detail shortly and playback from a audio player as we see in the upper right through a amplifier that can pass the full frequency range in bandwidth and reproduced using a select tweeter that's feeding the test subjects which in this case is myself at about 8 inches from the source and we're using a sound pressure level of about 90 dB so the way the test works is that you first hear the full bandwidth of the chime now we're looking at the graph below the center graph so you see the the the amplitude signature of the full bandwidth chime and that's in this case one kilohertz high-pass sample and then after that finishes you hear another version of the sample with the filter in place and in the case of this particular side there's a 20 kilohertz high pass example and you see that the amplitude has been somewhat reduced because the full energy has been reduced and after that there's a repeat of the original sample so when taking the test you progressively step through all these variations as shown in the table at the left where you move the high pass filter up in one kilohertz increments and at some point you'll report back I don't hear anything and this will give you a reference frequency range here we see an example of the time plot when the bandpass or the high-pass is at 5 kilohertz and we'll play a sample of that so you'll hear the chime with the full bandwidth then you'll hear it with the 5 kilohertz high-pass and then you'll hear the full bandwidth again so we've just talked about test 2 which was using a high-pass filter this I feel is a very sensitive test because all you're hearing is just the high frequency content by itself without any other bits of music or any other related sounds but in reality if you are listening to a audio system what we're talking about is what happens if we limit the high frequencies using a low-pass filter and that's shown in the center upper graph where we again see the full chime which is actually the dark blue curve and then we see progressively the red purple green etc curves were we are moving the filter to higher and higher frequencies and in the graph right below it there's an example of first seeing the full bandwidth chime and then seeing a low pass filtered example in this case at 5 kilohertz and finally followed by full bandwidth so here's the idea when you first hear the full bandwidth all of your listening skills will come into play when you hear the low-pass bandwidth you will at the first listening here's something that sounds very bad limited and not high file I cat all and noticeably restricted but as the filter moves up and up in frequencies you'll reach a point where the full bandwidth and the low-pass bandwidth essentially sound the same in other words you don't need more bandwidth and again these tests are available in 1 kilohertz steps which you see on the left hand side where we have a 1 to 2 kilohertz and then it goes all the way up to 30 kilohertz again reproduced by the same loudspeaker amplifier and player so the thought here is that most likely you will get a different answer than you did with the high-pass test because of a phenomenon known as masking in other words the lower frequencies of the of the chime are masking the higher frequencies so that most likely the answer you get here will be a lower number than you did at the when you were using the high-pass filter so here again is an example of what these things sound like the first thing you're going to hear is the full bandwidth recording of the of the of the chime followed by a low-pass demo and then the full bandwidth again this will be sort of like listening to full bandwidth and then AM radio or FM versus AM radio to use an analogy so let's summarize what we've talked about so far by using these three tests one two and three listeners will have determined for themselves under listing conditions of their choice a dynamic range measure and a bandwidth measure for which they can perceive no further improvement now they can use this data to help them determine the benefits of these two aspects of audio reproduction relative to the claimed capabilities of high resolution audio let me now talk about how these tests were created and how I validated them so that I felt comfortable and confident that the tests that are being presented were accurate and meaningful here we see the setup for the chyme recording and as you see I'm using a Latin percussion bar chime which is often used by percussionist with their drum kits etc and at about 12 inches from and I placed a quarter inch flat pressure measurement microphone with the protective grille removed I'll speak to that issue in a minute and it's a quarter inch condenser microphone made by a company called G Ras that microphone goes into its power supply and then it feeds the tascam dr-60d 24-bit PCM digital recorder a little bit of detail about the the microphone the microphone you see on on the left is modular in the sense that if you look at the lower left corner you see which is called the ëthe of the electronics or preamplifier for the microphone in which the combination of the capsule and a protective grille screw on also you'll see that the protective grille can be removed and the microphone can be used either with the grill on or off and to cut to the chase the calibration of the microphone with the grill off and which is the which is the situation that was used for the measurement is shown in the the lower curve in green and you can see that we clearly have a very uniform frequency response up to at least 40 kilohertz continuing now let's look at the recording that we made of the chime in this case we're going to look at its spectrum where we're going to plot its frequency versus its output or its output versus its frequency and I've got two curves I'm showing here the blue curve is the output of the tascam recorder and the red curve is the output of the tascam recorder feeding the power amplifier that drives the loudspeaker we notice a slight increase in level by looking at the red curve down at lower frequencies which I believe are attributable to a certain amount of intermodulation Distortion but they are quite low and level and I believe are not a factor based on the results of people listening to these signals let's now look at the sound source that we used or the speaker this is the the tweeter it happened to be happens to be a tweeter made by a company called timpani and here's the model number and I have mounted this conveniently in a 90 degree piece of PVC pipe to make it practical to position so that it can be used to provide a sound source for the person and I've made two of these and as you can see in the plots here the bandwidth of this tweeter is pretty much uniform between a thousand Hertz and a little over 40,000 Hertz the green curve is the background noise of the during the measurement so you can see that the signal being measured is that of the actual speaker and not background noise now we bring the the chime recording into perspective by looking at the output of the tweeter that's playing back that same recording you saw so here again the blue curve is the recording output from the tascam recorder and the purple is the acoustic output of the of the tweeter itself where we see a little bit more low frequency information do I believe to the intermodulation distortion aspect of the tweeter being used the question of course is does that get in the way of the measurement as you can probably see the chime has a definite sound signature whereas these harmonic intermodulation distortion products have a different signature so in testing one can tell if they're listening to the band limited chime or some artifact of that now we see the actual in use situation where we have a test subject again myself sitting about eight inches from the test speaker which is reproducing the various test signals and the presentation level is about 90 DB SPL and that would be measured with the head gone with the sound level meter at about 8 inches and this is a situation in which all the tests are conducted so my feeling is this has high face value and then it's a real sound and it's being produced at what one would call a healthy level let's now look at the validation of the dynamic range recording and reproduction test if we look at this filter we see a plot of the output of a of our tascam recorder playing back a series of files in which pink noise was the signal and the signal was progressively in this case attenuated by 10 DB steps and you see that the actual results tend to smear together as you get down to the between minus 90 and minus 100 DB which are really a factor of the dynamic range of the electronics in the recorder which is something that I've noticed on most every one of these recorders and playback devices that I've used but you can see that the steps going down to minus 80 DB are quite uniform and that you do get a definite reduction when you go to minus 90 and minus 100 now these were run with pink noise what I found when using pink noise was that the person listening would find that since the pink noise has no real information their threshold for saying this is as quiet as I can hear was higher than if I use music because music has information in it so I chose to use an information clip and you can see the picture of the CD up there this was a Linda Ronstadt with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra playing the tune straighten up and fly right and that was what was actually used to do the test here now are a couple of ways in which you could audition this test one would be with circumaural earphones or insert earphones not shown of course is to listen with loudspeakers now the point I'm trying to make here is that the background noise in the room or your listening is going to mask your ability to hear low level sounds so to make this test quite real I've decided that it's best to use earphones depending upon your preference the circumaural type headphone or insert earphone are the logical choices the most sensitive results have been observed using insert earphones because they have the ability to seal the ear canal and block out background noise which allows you to hear lower level signals with less masking from the background noise a good question is what sort of bandwidth might we expect from these headphones here we're talking about audio that can be recorded you know well beyond 20 kilohertz and most of the typical measurements made on earphones don't go up that high so I've developed a technique in which I use what I call a real ear measurement and I place a very small probe microphone what you see in the center on the top compared to a dime that's about a tenth of an inch in diameter and attentiveness long that is inserted in my ear canal to the point where it touches my eardrum backed up packed off very slightly and then the earphone is placed on my head in the lower-left curve or inserted into my ear on the lower right curve and we see that there is useful information being played back out to 40 kilohertz easily this just demonstrates that there are quite a few headphones that don't have a complete fall offer of response beyond 20 kilohertz now we did some testing at the Chicago AAAS section meeting and we also did some testing at the hundred and thirty ninth a as convention in October November of 2015 here are a few example pictures of a person doing the bandwidth and the dynamic range test and I've organized things typically so that the person can run their own tests and if they wish they can tell me what the results were or they can keep them to themselves I find it most interesting that most people have no problem reporting back what they hear in Chicago we had a little more time and more equipment to do this at the meeting this was held in the SN Shore theater at sure and here you can see various people at different times taking either the bandwidth test or the dynamic range test here are test results so far that's as of the 24th of November 2015 and I might add that all of these test results have been self-reported in other words that the test was set up for the individual and the individual reported the results and I recorded them so as to test one which is the dynamic range using music of these results have ranged between about 60 and 85 dB with most of the results clustered around 70 DB getting into the bandwidth test first using the high pass filter these results have ranged between approximately 10 kilohertz and 20 kilohertz with most around only 14 kilohertz finally the test three which is bandwidth test using low-pass filters these results have ranged between 10k and about 18 kilohertz with most around 13 kilohertz so I thought it would be interesting to make it possible for interested viewers to do their own testing and to give them a sort of a jump start on what I think it would take now there's nothing to prevent you from playing back these files on any equipment that you might have I would certainly encourage you to do that this will give you the answer to the question what happens when I use my own equipment but it may be that your own equipment has some limitations and therefore you're not really able to test your acuity so the next few slides show you how you might do something for yourself this has been organized with a certain amount of cost in mind so we talked about now assembling your own demo and test system hardware so you're going to need some kind of a player I've showed two examples here one being this sony model nwz a 17 and the other the pono player both of which I've measured and find that they do an excellent job of reproducing the signals and then an amplifier that is capable of reproducing the bandwidth as required I would comment though that the amplifier is not of sufficient signal-to-noise ratio to do the dynamic range test the desire here would be to use the earphones right out of the player itself but it's quite adequate for the bandwidth test that we see in the upper right so here's a amplifier that's available from Dayton audio parts Express for about 88 US dollars and then there is a tweeter that I'll tell you about in a minute that can be put into the tube and then a sound level meter can be either purchased from RadioShack for example if you can still find one and also you can use one of many apps that can be run on your smart phone so you're going to want to be able to verify the distance and the SPL when your head is missing so you can as I said you can use your own source but if you're you're wanting to build your own here's a detailed plan of how I built what I did the key parts are a tweeter from parts Express where I've given you the part number a right angle piece of PVC plumbing tubing a plug cap that goes at the end and a adapter so that you can thread it on to a photographic stand or a mic stand and as you read through you can find all the the part numbers and so forth so if you want to go out and buy all these things you can and the reason I put the black cap plugs at the end was to protect it as you're moving it around and I vent them so that if you slip the cap on which tends to be somewhat airtight you don't damage the tweeter diaphragm next we turn to obtaining the test files that you would need to do this and I have provided a couple of options here the first option is to go to a British web site which is code on the software dot a C dot uk' and register there's no cost to register and after you register and get approved which is not difficult to do you can gain access to the files that I've created that are being stored there and as you see in the under the circle there's the two high pass I should say the high pass chime test the low pass bandwidth test and the dynamic range test you can download those and use those and there's no no cost whatsoever if that doesn't work for you you can contact me Bob shoe line at shoe line and Ameritech dotnet for all files which I can send you a via Dropbox so as I said in the beginning I believe there are some other factors to consider which means that if you find that the dynamic range and the bandwidth issues are not really of importance based on what the high resolution files have to offer there are other factors which I believe have been and can be important and these involve the necessary filters that are used in making digital recordings referred to as anti-aliasing during recording and anti imaging during playback various dithering schemes and clocking techniques that are used in such systems but I'm speculating right now that the these are the areas which will show up differences that may be responsible for what various critical listeners say they hear as differences between system systems and components reproducing high resolution audio and the question will then be what does it take to minimize to reduce these artifacts to inaudible 'ti what I'm showing here is a couple of papers generated from a conventions that I believe deal with these other factors one was written by Bob Stewart and others Bob Stewart's company meridian has come out with this mqa process just as a sidebar and here he's talking about the audibility of typical digital audio filters in a high fidelity playback system these are available through the Audio Engineering Society and here's another one dealing with jitter what it might sound like and how important these authors thought it might be next there's a white paper that I think is interesting which will give you some insight about something called ringing or factors that have to do with how these filters are designed this is from a company called a whi re-air I believe they are the company that designed the signal processing for the pono player and you can use this website or this URL to hear about what they have to say about these things so in summary three tests have been presented that addressed the two major perception aspects of high resolution audio with reference to the standard CD one of these relates to the dynamic range or bit depth and to relate to bandwidth a frequency response I'm also pointing out that an area of focus for the future is to look into the perception of in-band artifacts which I believe relate to the use of the necessary digital low-pass filters so with that I thank you for listening and I would invite you to contact me if you have any suggestions or comments particularly on the future the study area that I'm looking into you can contact me at my email address which I'm showing you here"

the player that we use to you know um to trigger the the duck in in in our phones and to play the music with the most beautiful sound over our amplifier i was doing that with power amp and power amp is a beautiful player that is created 10 years ago by maxim petrov so big credits and thumbs up to maxim petrov you know for power amp 2020 he's still there he's still developing and it's world's best music player uh even according to xda so it's not only me saying this but xda as well confirms that this is the just the very best player in the world it costs 3.99 and you can install it and use it for two weeks on your phone so yeah go ahead test it out i will show you how to use it and how to trigger the duck and how to you know let your output of your you know your headphone output as well push 24-bit uh sound to your amplifier if your duck supports it of course i showed some videos in the previous premiere and you saw that several phones have very good uh built-in ducks digital audio converters so um yeah i'm very happy to show this this this player to you and i hope that many of you will buy it and that many of you will use it at least test it and see the difference between you know normal music players mp3 players and power amp so welcome to a new tutorial thank you for tuning in and have fun with power amp important this is not a paid promotion i'm doing this from the heart there we are in the android phone with m player installed this could as well be your android phone this is the very best audio player that i found until now in android world that comes without ads that plays music in a super fantastic way it has possibilities that now i would love to show to you so welcome to a new tutorial here at channel 48 how to use power amp power amp is the name of the application and whenever you're gonna boot it up you can find your songs by letting it do a scan sometimes you must reboot the device for it to find the songs yeah this is the equalizer part where you as well have your base and treble settings look at that this is just amazing especially when you're going to connect it to amplifier okay so don't expect uh super bass on on the internal speaker of your phone nothing like that this is not to play over your phone this is to connect to an amplifier or maybe to your headphones but be careful with playing loud music in your ears you know you can get death because of that so uh that's a warning and here you can see that we have a full equalizer that you can set up exactly the way you wish it all works fine you can set your base and treble but you can set even more you can set the balance stereo expand tempo you can change tempo if you wish and this is your main volume button so you have a beautiful complete player with its own uh uh yeah we say effector back with its own effects built in and compressor and and name it it's just an amazing player up here we have even more stuff i don't even know what this is reverb you can turn on the refurb look at that you can set delay etc so this is as well beautiful for for um yeah for acapella so there are many things that you can set with this player and there is no there's no better player in the world than this device so whenever you got your songs and everything is playing then you're gonna go to the settings and here in the settings you will find out that you can buy or amp the program costs 3.99 and it's really worth it and the trial you can use for about 14 days okay so yeah in fact yeah i i would buy it if i was you i would buy it hey send the errors to the developer so he can understand what is happening [Music] here you can see the build and it's by maxim petrov so maxim petrov big thumbs up to you for you know since 2010 for 10 years now working on you know this guy was there since since the samsung galaxy s you see that so go read about this so this guy is my hero okay if it comes up to audio because yeah i never saw audio player like this ever before in android world okay so um here you can see your albums your streams uh the thing will even play mp4 files for you without video of course it will only play the music this is not a video player okay so keep that in mind it's not a video player let me know [Music] that you can get out of it [Music] if you wanna be my you see a place very nice and you can set it up just the way you [Laughter] wish so what can i say yeah i can say just try it out it's completely free uh what is this oh up here you can get to the buttons all right i understand so you can as well go from here so how about if we put some reverb to the music let's listen [Music] if let me know [Music] not yet my little sister think it's it's it's dealing very very smart with with with the sound so let's go through some settings because i forgot to show you that so up here you can see by look and feels here you can set the look and feels you can set it to dark mode you see that now it will be to dark mode i think yes the audio most important up here you're gonna find several information about the audio you can as well crossfade uh your tracks here you can set the seconds i would set it to about 300 milliseconds or maybe even six eight six seven on 600 or so okay and this is normal so let's put it on normal let's learn from that silence between tracks zero milliseconds crossfade length oh wait a minute no no none we need the crossfade length 500 5000 milliseconds you can as well make it a little bit longer then it's gonna mix even nicer resembler direct volume control and output okay let's go to the output this is the very important one and here you can see that we have a high resolution output of 24 bit yeah via the wired or the aux that means the headphone jack via bluetooth we can have 24 bit sound and usb deck you see that this is high resolution output i was saying 196 kilohertz in the in the in the live show or in the premiere but i meant 192. i'm as well still learning about this okay and i'm very much inspired to to go deeper into this because i like this i love sound you can as well uh pair it with your with your chrome player not sure how to do that i'm not using that anymore i have one but i'm not really using it so you have a high resolution output of 24 bit 24 plus bits so yeah that is amazing and that's it in fact these are the most important things that you need to know and here you can set the custom volume panel shows when volume is adjusted in power amp so here you can go through several things enable music fx button android system audio effects in volume type okay for speaker of for high resolution output enable this speaker doesn't switch off after calls some notifications etc so there are many tweaks that you can go through in in this applications so i'm very happy yeah to to bring this to you okay and this is it uh i i yeah i advise it go go check it out it's it's power amp and you're gonna love it install it and you enjoy your music in an even more beautiful way this was my video about the power amp um tom shop once again to the development team there and thank you for watching so stay well and see in the next video again bye bye well i did not say too much you could see it yourself it's not that hard to use uh just set it up and you know go into the audio settings as i showed you just pause the video and and look at whatever i tapped and yeah set your phone or your tablet to play over the best possible player in the world and that is power amp so maxim once again thank you my russian friend i think you are russian petrov sounds kinda russian if not then you know no offense uh intended so me and russian we have no problems many russian developers as well and guys that create beautiful applications as well so maxime keep up the good work um yeah and all you audio fills out there digital audio fills that's how we're going to call ourselves digital audio fills sounds even better don't you think digital audio fills something of in 2020 corona time so stay well as i said as usual see you in the next video and peace out [Music] you

know what what is it what should it be and what does it often turn out to be well I could nitpick here because what you just said is what is high resolution audio and I actually learned something from the last time we spoke back in New York in June at the c/e Week events during a presentation that mark finer from the digital entertainment group put on where he rolled out a new logo for the music content that we want in higher or high res so there's now a music logo and a audio logo for hi-res so when you asking question I think we have a picture of those as well no the UM the two labels are the two logos we do yoga do those and that's kind of that's kind of weird that there are two different logos what the heck does that mean that's why I posed the question that I did hear that you that you put up on the graphic i created is i don't think you could find a handshake full of people that would know what the difference is between these and I in fact didn't know until I investigated and actually got in touch with the Japan audio Society some months ago because Sony originally some years ago and I would guess it's probably three or four years ago came up with the logo that's on the screen on the left hand side as I say at the gold and brown hi res audio mobile and they established a a set of requirements it doesn't say hardware or software on the PowerPoint slide that was forwarded from the group that I belong to it simply said these are the requirements in order to gain a you know license privilege of this logo for this logo and it includes 40 kilohertz uh basically it comes down to 96 k 24 bits between the source the microphone and the delivery and I stood up and cheered I said finally somebody is adhering to to specifications that make some sense that actually elevates our listening recording experience for those just for those who might not understand those terms let's make sure they everybody does 96 kilohertz is the sampling rate the rate at which the digital audio is being created which is quite a bit faster than what it is for CDs what we're most familiar with 24 bits is the bit depth of of each of those samples which is greater than the 16 bits that are used for cds which basically results in greater dynamic range and wider frequency response yeah uh not frequency response lower noise floor on the on the bits well the dance yeah and then the sample rate of course gives you wider frequency response but also gives you gentler filters and and that's helpful for those hardware guys out there trying to get rid of the the aliasing and over overloads the fold overs that happen when you have free kept sees beyond the Nyquist frequency okay so just what I wish we had that out of the way those are very good specs at 96 so I you know I start looking around I write on my blog post everyone smiling okay we've got this great specification let's let's universalize it let's make everybody adhere to this because your previous to that with the same organizations than there is folks and cea and labels as well as the DG DG came out with respect on what high resolution audio was high resolution audio not high resolution music they got confused themselves because it applies only to hardware because their definition had said you know anything better than CD quality and in even CDs into a higher bitbucket or analog tapes from the first part of the 19th 20th century rather would qualify so you know it's not clarifying anything it makes it worse the logo from Sony was then given to the jas the jas then came to the CEA and said would you like to use this make it available to your manufacturers here in the United States and so we just taught discuss that I thought it was a great idea then it finally got in touch with the jas myself I said so what's the deal here is well it's only for hardware it only applies for the DAX the headphones speakers the receivers any component that runs a signal end from the beginning and out to the end has to be you know 40 kilohertz capable than 24 bits but it doesn't apply to software in spite of the fact that as you look around on certain sites go buzz in France started using the high resolution audio logo for the content so we started getting contradictions and confusion again I kind of pointed that out I think it kind of nipped that the heels a little bit that they weren't consistent and the content people the people reselling you standard res audio in high res bit buckets and charging you a lot of extra money decided we should probably carve out our own thing because we're never going to meet the high res audio logo will come up with our own logo in our own set of standards which are in fact lower much lower than the hardware people so here you think you've got this great piece of hardware headphones speakers that will deliver all these wonderful new frequencies in dynamic range when in fact the music doesn't even keep up with half of that and that and we're now talking about the high res music logo the high res music logo says that we're we have content that needs to meet and have its own logo because we can't meet the jas specs let's create our own logo with lower specs those specs are generally now accepted to be 48 k 24 bits anything at that res or higher would qualify as high-risk music but here's the problem and it's one that you and I have chatted about before and has to do with the provenance of the file which is why the definition as it was presented by the cea press release in june of 2014 i believe came with a set of master quality or source indicators where's the sound coming from that ultimately shows up in a 48 24 96 24-bit PCM bitbucket well one of those could be a analog so any analog recording which is any analog recording not analytic any analog recording including a cylinder from 1906 if transferred at 96 k or 48 24 would we be able to wear the high risk music logo how ridiculous is that that's so we're ridiculous I mean you're knocking about these these cylinders which probably had a frequency response up to what 4 or 5 kilohertz so that's about it it only matters what the delivery container is in the minds of these people is selling the content which is obviously very frustrating very wrong and gonna kill the business if it hasn't already dented it you know heavily as as it is right now the second qualifier is PCM so PCM mqp master quality p so the source would come from a better than CD quality 44.1 p cm5 then there's one for d which is for DSD files which are our using it uses a different encoding technology and the less that's the technology for that's the technologies used for s-icd right exactly and there and there are files now divorced from essays CDs that go up to DSD 64 is the standard as they CD quality then there's dual or 128 and there's quad 256 there's even people talking about 5 12 which is getting way out of hand in terms of the sample it and files become huge with no sonic benefits at all but bigger numbers for selling things the last category which is the sort of perfect model we're defining remember high-resolution music as better than CD quality but one of the source files that can go into that better than CD quality can be mqc guess what the C stands for mmm CDs what yes like I kid you not a CD when it's the only thing that's available can actually be up rezzed and qualify as high-risk music except when you up r as a CD you're basically groped you get knowing you're getting no additional information right that's absolutely true so so it seems like that that seems pretty iffy to me well what it is and I've been told you know Point Blank what this is is if we're to tell people the truth it's bad for commerce so take it from there these are the marketing and executives who want to resell you the same thing one last time maybe that one last time but they would like very much for you to purchase Led Zeppelin purchase the Beatles purchase whatever out of the catalogs that they're simply rehashing and appraising or capturing again from analog tapes into bigger bit buckets and selling them at premium prices so the truth hurts that model I don't think it does because if you tell the truth only you have a long-term business but in this world we're going to pitch to retailers we're going to pitch to customers we're going to pitch to the whole mass market of music fans that if you buy something with either one these logos on it you're going to have a dramatically enhanced listing experience which is patently untrue

This has a high spec for such a small body. 

Review will be soon and below is a non affiliate from where I bought it from on Amazon UK but is available from a variety of outlets.

very extremely similar device but from a separate company and these separate untuk units as well so it should be should be quite a good thing so at fair m5 high res if that really matters to you difference but compared to their sounding is this does optics HD I think it's bluetooth 4.2 and that's the Shonan get 4.1 channeling gazelle duck up Tex all that good stuff nothing on the side it's on the side she should be legitimate I bought this up Amazon for my seller Papa seller someone sketch it off blah blah blah so yeah let's take a look it's down a bit let's start it's like a box in a box in a box start with the bottom should be cables ah this it comes of the case so this should be type C I think I can open the damn thing here we go the USB yep type C so that's pretty good so I'll need this in my shunning the archila things I own which are USB type-c my phone which is a ShowMe redmi note 4 I still USB microUSB that's pretty cool with this shining you have to buy this separate or filiz to come in the box so it says fear oops my mistake seemed strong enough but only time will tell ok that's pretty cool I didn't I didn't expect her I didn't expect that at all so should this be do it quick click through this Chinese English so it's actually got microphones that's pretty cool so you can actually take calls like I didn't know that the shun doesn't do that to achieve it Odile charging so we recommend to use a charger with DC 1 DC 5 our 1 amp or above so it's fine to tooth receiving ok it's got the colors lose SBC signs may see purple yellow and white only two USB duck so you can use with your computer which I guess you probably need a driver for K into French ok looks pretty good quite a few languages ah screen protector didn't expect that either authentic check in warranty card I'm pretty sure mine's genuine but it's pretty cool quite a bit of documentation open-source licenses and notes for using on Bluetooth really went to town on this this is like really big so I'll get into English because it's just a quick rundown of my Bluetooth and any issues the standards blah-blah-blah-blah-blah oh yeah it's an awful lot of documentation so it's move of smelly stuff anyway nice it's a fingerprint magnet first time I ever seen the high res audio Wireless you know icon I guess because you support optics HD as well it might it's the complete thing looks very similar size to my shine link it looks like it like every puff to be honest but SD card slot on the bottom the Charming's is on the wrong side and he's a little cover so that might be a little bit better here's B type C nothing nothing microphones volume up and down quite coaxial and headphone out and power power yeah here we go I know Theo of released a firmware update for this it should be 1.2 is the latest I think I can sit down and write up so that is unlock the screen I'll have to get real after you use this interface don't take that but how'd you get in a vise know who you can I'm used to here we go okay some of this is quite stiff into the quite similar to the Shandling which kind of lis seems kind of awkward I'd have to get used to how to you know because like if you keep going left and they're shining that's basically like going back like using Android how'd you get back okay so it's plane okay down a bit P 2 receiver settings recording so you can actually do recordings step counter okay I didn't know he could do that there might be car useful category no plain settings okay let's go system quite a bit screen out of standby you must be sleep recording quality lock screen that's right because you got line out and spit if seems a little bit smooth we needing that when he navigated in the flesh the menu system is very smooth the shunning is a little bit slower time and date I can do that another time so firmware one point two point one so I'd love to see what that is let's point SD card in it's just a 64 gig so you the three so that means it's ultra sweet I know it's beyond class 10 okay there we go okay yes and no okay you go back take media no there's not many tracks probably like ten albums on this folder on this SD card on normal SD card she forgot it zero songs updated okay let's go to [Music] various files this is the SD card that was in my phone so ignore all their Android and DCIM and me Isis click music playing Scott displays album art yeah just got to give this get used to this device it's a little bit tricky just to get used to so ago he's adding like this but this is about 30 minutes already holy moly say it guys I'm out a few days I'll be back with the review you know just trying to get used to it I'll see if there's a newer firmware out because I bought this from Amazon in the UK and obviously it must have been a while since it was made and then shipped and I don't know how long this was in stock I've seen not for long and I'll try you something Bluetooth I've got Bluetooth I've got some Saint Jose headphones which out upped X only not up takes HD so I'll do my best I can be that and this if you've got big fingers this might be tricky to play with but yet guys arm out and I'll be back in a few days with the review seems okay just got to get used to the the menu system so I touch logos

10:14:20.652945, greetings Amba nation and thank you so much for tuning in and joining me for a very special unboxing video I received this package in the mail all the way from Malaysia a few days ago and I am very excited to crack into this and show you what's inside the box certainly arrived in a little worse shape than I would have expected I would have thought that they would have used a bit of a thicker crush resistant cardboard but yes lo and behold it is the new I'm going to pronounce it as hi by our six digital audio player the packaging itself is quite fantastic and looks pretty sleek there's a lot of cool r6 and hi-bye logo inscriptions throughout the box if you flip the box over you'll notice it has this cool adhesive sticker on it listing all of the specs and different things that this particular device is capable of handling for you let's quickly go through them I was able to back the r6 through their IndieGoGo campaign and I selected the stainless steel model they also offered a silver and black aluminum model but honestly any time you can get something made out of stainless steel I'm gonna go for it yes there was a little bit of a price premium but it's totally worth it because the stainless steel model weighs 275 grams whereas the aluminum alloy only weighs 190 if weight is a matter of importance to you then by all means go for the aluminum I myself prefer a heavier feel when dealing with electronics and considering the fact that the r6 is basically going to be my home based rig I wanted to go for the all-out brick one of the biggest standout features of the r6 device is the fact that it uses not one but two ESS saber 90 28 queued action to process the audio the queue is basically like the mobile version of the pro chips right off the bat I'm already impressed with the quality of the packaging and the attention to detail this awesome little foam cover and then this lovely little book mark ribbon to lift the device and I can already feel its heft it is glorious it's got this really cool protective baggie which hasn't it very interesting almost a rubberized plastic feel before we look at the r6 itself let's delve into the depths of the box right here is that nifty little tool which you put in the little pinhole in order to eject the microSD storage slot nicely tucked away in another cool little packaging hi bye definitely outdid themselves and threw in some fantastic cables and notice there is a USB to USB C with some lovely hi-bye logos embossed on them and the feel of the cable it's this awesome really cloth cable plus the velcro ties were a nice touch and here is a 3.5 millimeter 2 coaxial audio cable as part of the backing campaign I received this really nice silicone protective case in a lovely gray color extra goodies are always welcome and lastly the instruction manuals and whatnot very cool anything that's printed into these day and age is awesome I consider that a plus which is sad because you used to get like paper copies of everything back in the day next up is a lovely tempered glass screen protector what's really cool is they mentioned in the campaign that a screen protector would come pre applied to the screen and you would receive an extra one as a backup which is awesome because my bane of existence is trying to apply screen protectors and so it's really cool that it not only comes pre applied but you get a second one shockingly the high bimanual is quite informative it gives these really cool layouts as you can see of all the different connectors and ports of the r6 itself as well as what signifies a balanced versus unbalanced cable lead definitely worth checking out if you pick up one of these hi byproducts finally moving on to the r6 unit itself unboxing this brought back strong memories of getting my first iPod which was the iPod dock connector it had the four eliminated buttons above the click wheel I don't know something about all the cool packaging and everything just really reminded me of the iPod but check this out oh my goodness it is glorious look at that brushed stainless steel especially even the the click buttons on the side I love tactile buttons that's something that tech products and society in general have really gotten away from and I'm so happy that they are just walking like your volume your play/pause your track skips the power button all tactile all brushed stainless steel fantastic look even the back of the unit itself this lovely black gloss glass plate which I was surprised to find out already has a screen protector applied as well and you also get a spare screen protector for the back plate although it is not tempered glass it is just a screen protector definitely looks and feels good in the hand the ergonomics are quite wonderful and I love the little screen protector sticker that's applied over the screen protector indicating what ports are exactly what and I love the little hi-res music sticker on the lower left my initial thought is that I am very very impressed with the build quality look and feel of the r6 unit let's quickly weigh it to see how accurately it compares to the estimated 275 grams and look my scale is showing 272 so I'd say it's pretty spot-on again the aluminum version weighs 190 grams so the choice is yours I hope you enjoyed watching this unboxing of the new high by r6 digital audio player I am so excited to start using the r6 over the next couple weeks with a range of headphones and music to really test it out I'll be uploading a review video of the r6 in the next couple weeks so please be sure to hit that subscribe button so you don't miss out as always thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video

by Cyrus logic inside this means that one DAC is for the left and the other one is for right and this was done so that it can produce the best sound quality and the highest resolution and a much wider and spacious sound delivery but it doesn't stop there the opposite umber 1s is based on Android operating system powered by the ARM Cortex a9 quad-core CPU up to 1.4 Giga earth it also provides bit to bit decoding and support a wide variety of audio formats such as WAV FLAC ALAC WMA DSD mp3 ogg AP e and a few others but let me know what you think I'm kind of curious do you think DSD make any difference sound I'm down in the comment section and tell me if you can tell the difference between DSD you just regular you also get a 3.5 millimeter audio jack port but one of the things that got me really excited about is the 2.5 millimeter balance out and I'm definitely gonna be checking that out in my full review and let you know how does it perform it has a four thousand milliamp hour battery inside at 3.7 volts that gives you about 11 hours of music playback time at 16 bit 44 point one kilohertz but make no mistake this is a 24 bit 192 kilohertz high resolution audio player with 32 bit processor core that should provide you with an unforgettable audio experience it also comes with 32 gig memory built in but it also supports microSD cards at a maximum of about 256 gig each and that's a lot of storage space but you're definitely gonna need it because those iris files is definitely gonna be really large so you definitely need all that space all right so enough of the spektr let's pop inside this box and see what office is done make us happy because right now I'm definitely excited alright how do we get in okay cool Oh looky here looky here oh alright let's get it on and see looky here looky here this thing looks amazing and it feels amazing - let's put it to the side I swear that's a snuff box all right so you got this little envelope with some screen protectors got some instruction manuals and then got yourself really nice USB micro USB charging cable let's move this uh there you go you also got another one on the back and I like the sound of that got really nice and shiny still really quick tour so real quick on the top definitely got his own in on that got that 3.5 millimeter audio jack port but then we got that balance out definitely want to check that out you got a power button right there this side you got I'm assuming this is a skip back and forward this is you're playing pause button this is your bottom button up and down right here at the bottom that charging port for micro USB I mean we wish we had some USB see cuz we definitely want USB see everything but micro USB is here on the back I got an opal number one hours audio this were got that dual card slot for those micro USB card 256 gigs each that's a lot of storage we're definitely gonna need all that space I'm gonna just do a really quick comparison real quick so this was my daily driver my Shandling m1 but just to a quick reference just showing you there m1 and everyone is really dope I love it now we're gonna see because and we got the new kid in town oh post number 1s as I said before this is probably one of the best budget gap you can buy right now see if you're looking forward up and you got your hands on that sqm turn and you definitely can reach that price this is it right here at about 398 or 399 I think you can definitely get one of these I'm definitely gonna be testing it out first thing I'm gonna do is I got our final trio I res earbuds right here definitely gonna be testing out with this this was my daily driver earbuds with my Shannon m1 but now he's gonna be the pair right here like I said this was a knob boxing video didn't want to make it too long because I definitely kind of get into some details on the review video but power it up you see she's got some juice in it we opals there you go ready to go from the looks of it it's almost like they already loaded it with some really nice Irish songs definitely gonna be checking those out definitely gonna start off test with those that you can see so it does feel it feels really nice in the hands one thing I noticed though start picking up some finger print already so this kind of a fingerprint magnet especially on this side but this nice it's your right here I can't lie man this thing feels really nice really good I'm really excited I can't wait to start using this shout out oh pose you guys you definitely look it up I'm really feeling this I'm liking this one this is definitely a win already and I haven't even tested out yet definitely gonna be trying it out and letting you guys know by the way I'm also gonna be doing a review on the file fh1 and I'm gonna be definitely testing it out with this let you guys know what's up so I'm definitely feeling what the bit is done but it's all pose number 1s and looks good feels good feels super premium in my hands I like it and I definitely want to hear from you guys and let me know what you think down in the comment section right below the like button but if you want one for yourself definitely check the link down in the description and make sure to give this video a thumbs up but if you didn't like it you could also give it a thumbs down I'm on this one right now getting too excited I can't wait to turn the camera off do I can start checking it out alright talk to you my next video peace [Music]

You can stream high-quality digital music in a variety of ways to the system you already have.

Bluesound Node 2i (Black): https://www.crutchfield.com/i-rYTVc2HE/p_813NODE2IB/Bluesound-Node-2i-Black.html

Bluesound Node 2i (White): https://www.crutchfield.com/p_813NODE2IW/Bluesound-Node-2i-White.html

You connect the Node 2i to your existing amp or receiver, or perhaps a set of powered speakers, using the analog connections on the back. There are also digital outputs for connecting to a digital amp. Then you can stream music a number of ways. The Node 2i connects to your home Wi-Fi network, which lets you send high-res files from a connected drive, or you can use Apple AirPlay 2, or Bluetooth from any device. The Bluetooth is two-way, so you can send audio from the Node 2i to a separate Bluetooth speaker or pair of headphones.

One of the best things about the Bluesound Node 2i is the BluOS Controller app. It ties all your sources together, including streaming apps, into one intuitive app. You can even group different Bluesound speakers together for a multi-room audio system, all controlled from one app.

Bluesound sound quality is excellent, able to play high-res files up to 24-bit/192kHz and it can even decode MQA and DSD files. Bluetooth can stream in aptX HD if your device supports it, and Apple AirPlay 2 lets you stream high-quality files over Wi-Fi.

You can use this as a standalone music streaming device, or you can make it one zone in a multi-room high-res capable music system. Now how we get music into it, there so many ways. You can stream from most streaming services, including the MQA hi-res service from TIDAL, Spotify connect, Amazon Prime, Qobuz, and many more. If you have audio on your phone you want to send over and you have an iPhone or most other Apple devices, you can use Airplay 2, and that's really handy if you're watching a YouTube video or Netflix on your phone and you want to hear it on your HiFi system, you can AirPlay 2 it over to the Bluesound Node 2i. Also, if you have music stored on your PC that's on the same home network is this you can grab that music and play it here on the Node 2i, or if you have a network attached storage drive. In either case if you have it filled with hi-res music, this can deal with it. The D-to-A converter in here can convert that and make it sound great. It also has Bluetooth with aptX, so it sounds better than your normal Bluetooth, and if you simply want to put a bunch of music on a USB thumb drive you can just plug that directly in and play the music right from the Node. There's also a 3.5 mm auxiliary input, which can either be analog or digital so that you can plug a component directly into it. The Node 2i is ideal to use with your existing HiFi music system, so whether you have a set of powered speakers or separate components or even a receiver, the Node 2i has a set of analog RCA outputs, a subwoofer output, an optical output, and a coaxial digital output. And there's one other way to get music out of the Node 2i. The Bluetooth is actually two-way. Not only can you send music to it from your smartphone, but you can actually Bluetooth music out of the Node 2i to a compatible set of headphones. So maybe you want to do some late-night listening and not wake up the rest of the family, that's a pretty handy feature that you won't find on most products. Now let's talk about how you're going to control all of the music and how you're going to play it here. There's a couple ways to do it. The main way would probably be with the Bluesound app. Now Bluesound is a multi-room music system, you can have speakers in all sorts of different rooms, soundbar, powered speakers, things like the Node 2i connected to your existing systems, and all of those can be zones, all of which can be controlled using the Bluesound app on your phone, and that maybe the main way you control the Node 2i, but it's not the only choice. There are a set of top-mounted controls that are just touch sensitive for basic controls of the music that you're playing, there's an optional infrared remote control available from Bluesound, so if you'd rather have a separate remote control specifically for the Node 2i you can do that. There's an infrared input, so if you want to hide the Node 2i away and use that infrared remote, you can certainly do that. If you already have a remote laying around you like to use, like maybe the remote for your integrated amp, for your receiver, you can even use the app to set up and configure the Node 2i to respond to infrared commands from another brand's remote. So that's the Bluesound Node 2i. You can use it as a standalone music streamer, or or as part of a much bigger multi-room audio system. Either way, I think you'll find it sounds great and gives you lots of options. If you have any questions about the Bluesound Node 2i, go ahead and throw them in the comments, we do look at those and we will answer your questions there, and of course while you're at it, hit that like button, subscribe to our channel so you get notified when we put out new videos.

263,oYXB5ZP2544,Digital Trends,UC8wXC0ZCfGt3HaVLy_fdTQw,Sony turns up the volume on hi-res audio with its latest Walkman - CES 2015,"Sony’s grandiose press event at CES in Las Vegas again solidified the company’s push toward the proliferation of high-resolution audio (HRA) with the reveal of its new flagship player, the Walkman NW-ZX2.

A sleek chunk of composite material and glass, the ZX2 is as hefty as it is elegant, marked by a robust black facade along the exterior, and a full touch screen extending along the front face. The ZX2 runs on an Android-based operating system, and unlike a lot of high-resolution portables we’ve encountered, such as the Astell and Kern AK240, the interface is set up almost like a phone, offering Wi-Fi support and a suite of apps.

For the full episode, go to http://twit.tv/show/home-theater-geeks/223.",28,1632,0.0,7.0,0.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WcxKdRNuJVc/hqdefault.jpg,TWiT|TWiT Bits|Best Of,2020-10-07 10:14:20.653111, this is true the the big question that I think you and I both are interested in is how much does high resolution audio improve the sound can people hear it the difference obviously or is it only a very subtle difference so tell me about how the experiment came to be what you and I started talking but I don't want to be the one talking here I'd rather let you be doing the talking so give us a little history of this experiment how it got started and what we wanted to investigate how we set it up sure I I peruse you know various websites and and with the emergence of high res audio as being sort of a you know a topic these days it's going to be featured at the aes convention in a couple of weeks and it was a big event last summer during siiii week that i know you were aware of and participated in it's always been argued in these in these various tests that people do I was in touch with a guy in Barcelona that was putting on a test and I wrote back to these people including the big Meyer and Moran 80s paper stating that what you know you really have to have raw material the stuff that you're evaluating as to whether it is perceptibly different than a standard CD if it was a high res file has to actually contain content that exceeds that of a traditional CD and the Meyer Moran study was was completely useless because it didn't all of the files all of the cds sa cds DVD audio real-time down-conversion 244 one was done on content that came from analog tapes and from other sources that didn't contain any additional dynamic range or frequency response than a standard CD so how can you test for something doesn't exist and what was very interesting about that Myers and Moran test just let me interject here is that they concluded that that there was no significant perceptible difference between I res audio and CD audio which of course they would and they used a number of people coming in and out but I think the general conclusion would have been reached since there was an a truly high resolution content in the stuff they were they were playing exactly i mean that's that's the point is people you know push that article quite heavily and even the aes published it in their journal and it's been you know quoted many many times as well this is proof positive that high resolution music doesn't matter why why we going all the time in trouble to try and record with higher sample rates and longer brooklyn's I mean they're not alone in in that but I get you know I see enough of that quote so I was very curious fact I was in touch with one of the researchers at the time and I asked him well what did you play what was the content that you actually played for your assembled group they're the people that were part of the Boston audio society and so forth and the fact came back that the list which you can see online now you and I have communicated about it it's all you know Elton John and a number of cesky records done in sacd and and there's only one DVD audio in there I think actually something capable at 96 24 um I can't remember exactly which one I think was maybe a steely dan record but all of them were contained well contained within the parameters the specifications of a compact disc so if you're testing something that starts as a compact disc fidelity and then is down converted to CD quality how are you expected to have any you know any difference so that kind of it seems no brainer but but people still argue about it so you know I'm not here to advocate that the you know of the one way or the other is the right way but I know that we aren't testing the right things until we come up with a rigorous test that starts improves I'm sitting in a room where I hope to have some speakers from from my friends out of JBL and Harmon reference monitors now the coke 240k and amplification and a complete chain from the sources my sources and others where I can play for people in here in stereo Orion to surround a material that I can measure with a microphone in here that exceeds the CD if we can do that then we at least got a start for the test and and the procedures for that test life we worked out this part of what I'm trying to push for is a is a rigorous scientifically valid tested that really sets the sets the stage for answering the question can we are can we not receive as human beings the sound difference between a compact disc at a 96 kilohertz 24-bit high resolution version of the same exact file not something's been remastered very same file and that's where you and I got talking saying you know I do have content that qualifies why don't we try a casual test and I will prepare those files i'll take the 96 24s and down convert them and and will seemingly qualify people for for high-resolution systems and see whether people can tell the difference and I did the test myself and and and you know we can talk about some of the results that came along but I believe that there is a a benefit whether it's obvious whether it's subtle you know I think it's it's it's on the margins but given that we have hardware and playback forums our formats that can contain at least 96 24 and I think that's enough actually then we can we can more accurately reproduce what was in the room at the time the musicians were playing

Receiver|Micrphone|Recorder|Unboxing|Review|First Impression,2020-10-07 10:14:20.653159, [Music] POC Network here with another unboxing this time coming from the company file and this is their small solution for a high resolution portable player now if you remember which you probably do the iPod or yeah iPod shuffle a small little thing that kind of came and went you know those are right it was pretty good was it high res sort of kind of but there's better solutions out there and it's so small and is hard to work for sometimes and you know then they upgraded it and they got better and and well now you have an alternative option this is again file and this is their m5 portable high resolution player that can do a lot of things now we've recently covered another one of their players not too long ago which is one of their it's their full-size player that was actually pretty cool we loved it you know so now we get to see if their small little micro version is just as cool but this is something that can handle up to 384 kilohertz in 32-bit audio depending on the format that you're feeding it which is really cool it can do DSD 128 and more you have its touchscreen its bluetooth 5.0 so it's going to have a px HD and all that fun stuff with it l DAC and it can also be used as a USB DAC for your computer so if you connect this to a PC you'll be able to use it as an external USB DAC but for now what we want to do is see what it comes with see what it looks like and then you'll find out more about this on the website at POC network net once you've had some time to really give this thing a test so as you can see I've already unsheathed it from its outer layer you have your inner layer here that's broken into two compartments the top compartment contains the player itself now the player is definitely just it's definitely bigger than the iPod shuffles those little nano players that they they got really small and this is almost almost twice the thickness but it also has an external case to go with it it's more like just a clip where it slides into this clip it's protective on both sides and the back and then you just hook this to your pan so you're sure it's somewhere without knocking into any kind of microphones or accessories that you might have attached to you the second apartment contains some of your accessories you have a little fold-out here with multiple different languages that just says notes on using your Bluetooth enabled devices so it walks you through in many many different languages on connecting this to your Bluetooth devices smartphones tablets and so forth you have an open-source licenses list but probably nobody's going to read and a warranty card that gives you information about your warranty which hopefully you will read just in case hopefully nothing ever goes wrong but in case it does at least you'll be a pro on what to do next you have a USB to USB type-c cable for charging it with and a decent length - it's not just like five inches as some of these devices like to give you and further behind both those sections you have a of course a couple pieces here you have two plastic just nice and thick might be just bendable tempered glass I'm gonna go with the plastic though but this is so it you know you can protect the screen from scratches or anything like that so getting two of those is pretty cool you have a QuickStart guide that's filled once again with all sorts of different languages on how to use their product and everything from Japanese to French to German Italian and of course English you know but it's two pages two and a half pages so one two three and that's it it walks you through the basic functions of the the player touch screen and everything else now looking directly at the player you have everything pretty much on the top and bottom and I say pretty much but it is top and bottom on the bottom you have a micro SD slot right there for adding music to it with an SD card so if you have a micro SD card laying around and you want to just fill it up with some tracks put it in here then you have a USB type-c connection here that's what this cable is for and it's got two functions a it's for charging the device so that way this will last it has a battery life of around 10 or at least up to 10.5 hours so it's going to get you through a day especially a busy day as well and if you hook it up to a computer that's where it also performs as a USB DAC so you can prove on the audio coming out of your computer or a laptop by using this as an external amp to really drive any kind of you know headphones or speakers and and give some more umph to what they used to sound like just coming out of the normal headphone port in your system on the top of the unit you have your power button right here you have your volume up and down and the coaxial out which is actually your headphone out so if you just plug in your headphones in there you'll get headphone out if you plug in a coaxial connection into there then you'll get digital out so we got analog digital one single 3.5 millimeter connection to get you going so that's pretty cool there's no adapters or anything like that for it I believe the other player did come with an adapter but don't have to worry about that on this but it's super small again it's touch screen I'll go ahead and turn on see if it has a charge here mmm it does so it boots up but just by holding down the button for a number of seconds again it has a touchscreen it has microphones built into two actually on both sides of the volume toggle there are two microphones and they kind of serve two functions you have noise cancelling so it can just listens to everything around in your environment to help cancel out some of that noise and then of course you also are able to record using this as a personal recorder so if you want to record you know let's say a reminder for yourself or maybe someone's talking to you and you're like oh I want to record this so I have this to go back to it later you can do that with this just pull the recorder hit record and it's listening to you via those two microphones so when you first turn to bond you have a menu here it just says what do you want you want English and I say yes I want English and it gave me everything in Japanese so I might have I might have gotten excited on there so be careful on what you click on looks like we're gonna have to find our way through this menu which was actually pretty easy I just went to settings scroll all the way down and languages right there so sure enough it was selected that I just switched it over to English and swipe to the right to get rid of that swipe to the right to get rid of it and I'm back in the menu and everything everything's in English and we're good so you have will start at the settings screen here you have settings you have recordings that's your voice recorder step counter so I get some fitness out of this category so category music I click on that you got all songs artist album genre favorites and playlist you have now playing so you can listen to what is currently playing and there's your play menu where you have your pause next track previous track yeah and well random it looks like maybe favorite button add to playlist so you get some pretty good features right there just on the little play screen beyond the now playing you have browse files you can browse around to see what files are on here I click on that says please insert an SD card so you do have to use the SD card to supply any kind of capacity to this the last thing in the menu is BT receiver bluetooth receiver and what that means is you can connect this to a stereo system or any other solution that you can take an input and just use the headphone out so you do headphone out to like RCA or any any other format you want to go and this becomes a receiver so you can actually give that stereo system bluetooth if it doesn't already have it natively built-in so if you have an old vintage stereo system or something like that you want to stream your phone to now you can just use this as the Bluetooth receiver added to that system so that's it that is the file m5 a high resolution portable music player that does many other things so you can use it as a USB external DAC for your computer or you can use it as a Bluetooth receiver for a stereo you can go headphone out or a quack show all of your inputs media is coming into the SD and so forth and so forth you can record audio via the microphone so it's it's pretty cool so go check it out at POC Network dotnet once we've had some time to actually get an idea about what we think about this if this is if it sounds just as good as their other player and so forth so POC network dot net if you

lastpass.com slash twit to learn [Music] [Applause] hello everybody time once again to answer some questions in our mailbag it's asked the tech guy I'm Leo Laporte and I got this email from John in Allentown Leo I'm interested in high res audio I remember you're doing a podcast with a well-known musician a few years ago who started the movement in high res audio of course it was Neil Young of Crosby Stills Nash and young and of course his great solo career he's a big fan of these higher quality recordings he goes on to write since then I've had the chance of hearing the difference between high res audio and standard audio through some of the streaming music services I have a trial subscription with title and I've had a subscription to Google Play Music for many years I'm impressed by the quality of titles master quality albums I feel like I'm in the recording studio I purchased an inexpensive music player and I've experimented with downloading FLAC files from the internet though the process of converting these files to one compatible with Apple iTunes remains a cumbersome process and confusing also adding metadata to the player with player with song titles album name and artwork still evades me please cover this topic it's a huge interest of mine and the one that hasn't been covered in a long time yeah it was Neil Young he came on triangulation some years ago he he was such a fan of high-quality music he created this this is the pono player the portable music player digital music player that has very high quality electronics but also the capability of playing back high-res music let me tell you what high res music is first when you're listening to an mp3 or an AAC file that comes from Apple iTunes you're listening to music that's compressed so it takes up a smaller space in the hard drive and it's compressed using a kind of compression we call lossy that is bits of the music are actually removed to make it smaller the theory behind mp3 and later AAC lossy compression is there are certain frequencies your ear won't hear if a related frequencies playing so the theory is if you hear a particular frequency you can remove all of those related frequencies just take them out of the music because your ears aren't going to hear it anyway with without I'm talking too much about the validity of that I think it's pretty clear to anybody who's listened to mp3s that while the quality is good it's not quite as good as either uncompressed music or music compressed using a lossless technique so that's the first issue is the quality of the compression and when you listen to a CD you're listening to uncompressed music now it is digital music it's not compressed but it is digitized that means the waveforms that float through the air and regular music are sliced they're sampled that's the term that we use at a very high rate of speed and that sampled music is then turns into ones and zeros which can be put on a pono player or an an iPod or an iPhone or on a CD or DVD that digitized music may or may not be compressed further but even if it's uncompressed it's not exactly the same as the smooth waveform that the music makes in the air it's just that you know this is the only way we can store it on that computer medium so when we're talking about high res music we're really talking about how high quality the sampling is completely independent of the compression so CD is sampled at 44,100 samples per second each sample is 16 bits of resolution so that means it can be any number from 0 to 65,000 or thereabouts so each 44 thousandth of a second we we generate a number based on the waveform and that number is turned into ones and zeros and that's the sample if you sampled it at a higher rate say instead of 44,000 100 times a second 96 thousands times a second or you sampled it with a higher resolution instead of 16 bits maybe 24 bits that's called higher res music in fact many recording artists record at a higher resolution than the actual CD that they distribute very commonly you'll see music sampled at 96 kilohertz 96 thousand times of a second and 24-bit the problem is those files get very very big they have to have professional digital recorders to do it and they use up a lot of hard drive as the record I Joe Walsh once what he recorded out he says now those files are too big I do I do 44 one 44,100 samples a second but I do it at 24 bits so it's not quite as big not as many you know same number of samples as a CD but maybe a little bit higher resolution recording to keep the file sizes down he thinks it doesn't make that much difference and I think there are a lot of people who think it doesn't make a lot of difference in fact there are a lot of people who think Neil Young and his pono player arsenic oil that you can't really hear the difference it all comes down to something called the Nyquist theorem which says how much information you need to record to record a certain quality of music and essentially the Nyquist theorem says high res music is going to produce music that is inaudibly better it's it's yes got more information but your ear can't tell the difference there's a lot of evidence that's that that's the case I for a long time did buy high res music I think the best thing you can do is buy uncompressed music and if you if you can buy it at a slightly higher sample rate or ideally the original sample rate of digital recordings yeah that's gonna be the full quality that's gonna be every bit of the sound that was recorded in the recording studio I should warn you though a lot of high res music is resampled analog recordings tape recordings and those there's no point in making those high res because that information isn't on the tape so there's beautiful recordings for instance Miles Davis classic jazz album kind of blue that was recorded on reel-to-reel tape you can't really make a high-quality high-resolution digital version of that the information is just not on the tape but you can't do a few things to get the maximum quality off of that tape or or the Beatles all of their recordings were also analog there's only so much you can do with those probably the most important thing you can do is not compress your music too much remember when you compress music and iTunes or you compress it with an mp3 compressor you can choose how many bits per second very common most music is compressed from that forty four one 16-bit CD to 128 kilobits per second so when you record typically on an mp3 you're recording at 128 thousand bits per second 64,000 for the left channel 64,000 for the right channel that gives you a pretty good result but you are chopping out more of that music if you can get to 256 kilobits twice as good the music I think you're gonna hear fewer glitches and artifacts is going to be truer to the original source same thing with AAC AAC as a more modern codec so it does a better job at 128 kilobits Apple stores its music when you buy music on iTunes for instance at 256 kilobits AAC that's pretty good quality but Apple has its own lossless codec the apple lossless codec there's a comparable open source version of that flack if you can take a CD and and digitize it using flack or apple lossless then you'll have the same exact quality that the CD delivered you're not giving up anything you're not compressing it you're not taking any data out and I think that's the best way to store your CDs the good news is hard drive storage has gotten cheaper the storage on your phone has gotten is expanded and less expensive so you don't need to be as heavily compressed that's probably the most important thing so that's what in my opinion the current kind of thinking is that a lot of these super high-res recordings many of them were kind of snake oil because they were made of analog recordings if you've got a digital recording if you can buy it at the original recording rate of the master yeah why not that's gonna be better quality usually they cost more there are a number of places you can go online to buy that kind of music my favorite place to go is is a place called AIX records but you're not going to find many of your favorite music there because this AIX does most of their own recording that's how they make sure that you're getting a high res version of the music that's as good as the original but they do offer folk and jazz and classical and country and blues and pop so they have a variety of music there AIX is I think probably the best place to get high res music at least you know you're getting what you're pay for its AIX records calm in general them I would say just don't come over compress your music listen on good headphones one of the things the pono player does do very well has a very good headphone amplifier in it and a very good digital analog converter that may be more important frankly than anything we've talked about the the thing that converts it to analog and then the headphone amplifier that puts it into your ears that makes a big difference in the quality of music so that's a long way around of saying don't worry so much about high res just worry about music you love and compressing it as little as possible great question though I'm glad we could talk a little bit about this because times have changed in my thinking frankly has changed a little bit on this I

of stuff that's not about mastering as well my name is Ian Shepherd I'm a mastering engineer and I run production advice website aimed to help you get great results recording mixing and mastering your music and this week the topic is recording with high sample rates particularly because there has just been a new piece of research that has come out which casts a new light on the topic which I'll tell you about and I've invited along to be my guest co-host this week Russell Katya who is a producer recording engineer but also you do a bit of mastering as well if as and when required is that right that's that's certainly correct and yes yeah and we were just chatting before we started recording and you were saying that you know that's not something that you actively promote necessarily but presumably you get asked by clients to do you know you do some recording and some mixing for them and then they'll can you master this as well is that how it tends to go well yes I mean the first studio that I worked in out of university we would do mastering and that was in the days where people were bringing quarter-inch tapes so sort of as late as early today no idea how old well yes early 2000s so there were still people with analog studios sort of mostly private studios so I started off doing mastering in that aspect but yeah I do quite a lot of sort of Studio to studio mastering jobs where are the studios or semi things to do other clients you know like kind of thing and and I suppose most of what I produce myself or mix myself I tend to do the mastering primarily for budgetary reasons because you know that clients are always wanting to save some of their budget for promo or whatever they look and how do you find it mastering your own stuff or presumably working on the same rig when you're doing that it was listening to say monitoring and stuff sometimes I tend to leave it a few days you're obviously going to end up with with issues i mean my mix room is far from perfect so depending on where i'm mixing a project if i'm in a larger studio then it's not such a such a problem but if they're both mixed in the same space that that can be an issue you just something you've got to be aware of and you know keep an eye on and like any engineer in any studio you get to know your space and your monitors and that's a really interesting point then I mean you can tell me if you want me to cut this out but I'm remembering that recently you did a recording and Abbey Road Studios correct I did yes but yeah chose to mix it eventually in your own room well that's an interesting one I see mixed at Abbey Road estudio too and that's that's quite an interesting control room because it's it's probably not really an ideal mix room but yeah I mean it was that the content was mixed on the leaf in control room 2 and I wanted to do some tweaks I came back mixed in the box which was is kind of unusual for me actually yeah because you've got a really nice concept on me I've caught yeah its own it certainly got a back story it's the it's a to the a mech well it's likely the tack but it's been upgraded and it was used for a load of sort of Manchester bands badly drawn boy and I am kloot doves or like kind of stuff so so it's got a history 1983 I think so some yeah so thus the story is um you know Abbey Road you if you want something you can have it so you know I'm doing this mix on bruh Casti and big Nev desk and as I say I wanted to do some tweaks so I came back and and so rebuild the mix in the Box in Pro Tools and sent the files off to the to the client and the climb and said well I really like this this one that says ITB on the end of it so we'll we'll go for that one so deep it was literally d verb versus bruh Casti and internal mix now you know it's it worked in that situation whether it would be be correct for everything i don't know but i've seen one of my big themes I mean you know this is it ain't what you use it's the way that you use it and I think that's the perfect example because I mean correct me if I'm wrong I mean the other issue with working somewhere like abbey road is just to do with the budget in the sense that yes you know I don't know what a day their costs but it's considerably more than a day of your own time working in your own game and especially if you're working for a client who has a budget that they've given you you know I we all have to make you know it's a kind of it's a cost benefit thing isn't it you know with an unlimited budget and all the rest of it you might well choose to work someone like abbey road for an extended length of time until you get things right on the other hand you might well choose not to and both of those are valid choices but you know there's not many people who would have chosen to listen to one mix of another just because of the reverb its eggs exactly and that's that's this of key point isn't it um and and I suppose you know if you know your space you know what records sound like in that space you can push I'm not even sure what the difference is where I think there's just some small rides and obviously the summing was done internally but yeah I mean it's a matter of comfort isn't it and whether you whether you can bash our mix is much faster in your own space sometimes it's nice to go to other places and feel inspired but yeah in terms of in terms of the mastering sometimes what I'll do is yeah I work at a few Studios across the country and sometimes I'll just you know double check my work in other in other places if I've done the mix in the the room that I'm mastering in so wearing many hats has its benefits in some ways and obviously drawbacks in others yeah well I think I mean the thing is realistically speaking anybody you spoke to these days would say something similar you know I think from what I hear most especially kind of experienced mix engineers with a good track record are doing some degree of their own mastering even if it's just to give the clients an idea how it might sound when it's mastered and then they send that as a reference to the engineer who finally doesn't work Lee you know and and everything in between and it's like I was talking to two Lidge about that you know the kind of the blurring of the boundaries between a home studio and a real studio yeah yeah so but I think it's beautiful people who are listening to shows like this to hear because I think I find that information very empowering you know I mean like for example I know that um you know there's a ton of pro engineers who work predominantly in the box Dave pensado and Andrew Shep's and Dylan dres doh I think Mick Gadowsky works in the box a lot of the time a lot of the hip hop guys and you know R&amp;B producers are doing their own mixing so you know there's all that it's quite often not even a consideration to go you know out of the box yeah exactly one thing I will say is is that that I don't generally approach so a lot of projects I get in or kind of home recorded things or artists with their own small studios i'd say probably twenty-five percent come from from that kind of background and I'll quite often get stems sent so i can do small Corrections or liaised with them in you know over a series of steps say these this is the mixed week that I would advise before we go to the mastering stage so that's another sort of kind of approach to mastering I think rather than just saying give me the stereo track and we'll we'll move forward and having your own space does facilitate that I think as lazy was saying I'm you know the option of using your time as you desire and you've not got someone else Danya neck wanted to come into the studio and reset the desk for for a different purpose or whatever so worm yeah there's a lot of lot of guys and girls out there who are doing sort of multifaceted workflows and incorporating their own workspace into into their workflow whether it's just their own workspace or they're using big studios as well yeah absolutely no and like I say I think that's great for anybody here because you know it's well I mean that's that's genuinely how I believe the works you know it's it's the skills of the person doing the work rather than what losing and that kind of dovetails quite neatly into the topic I wanted to yeah address this evening which is this whole issue of high sample rates so I'm sure everybody listening to this knows that you know CD records at 44.1 kilohertz you can also record at 48 kilohertz which is used by DVDs and for broadcast for example and then we have the higher sample rates like 96 kilohertz and even 192 kilohertz or sacd which has some absurdly high summer right the big question is do those higher sample rates really sound any better because all of the scientific evidence suggests or suggested that we can't hear any higher certainly than 20 kilohertz and in fact most people once they're past the age of 18 probably can't hear much beyond 16 maybe 18 kilohertz now obviously that's going to vary from individual to individual so given that we can't hear those high frequencies what's the point in having a high sample rate to reproduce them and of course there's been lots of scientific research or on our loss there has been fair I'm out of scientific research different studies investigated in this different ways some of them used test tones some of them use real examples some of them aloud comparison with the original sound source some of them didn't and some of them quite a few of them have shown that know where there is no benefit to having high sample rates whatever people feel when they use them and some of them actually have shown that yes there is a benefit to hi sample rates and or higher bit depths so and the interesting thing that has happened just in this last week or so is that has been an aes paper released a properly peer-reviewed aes paper which is it's not a new piece of research on this topic it's what they call a meta-analysis so joshua rice who has put this together has basically compiled all the evidence he can possibly get his hands on from all of these different scientific investigations into this topic so you know if he found one study and it mentioned another study in the references he would go out and find the other study and if that mentioned other studies in that he would pull that together and I think in the end he had 12,000 separate trials of this subject where the high sample rates are beneficial or at least audible for musical quality or not and then they this is a technique that comes from medical research it's very common in medical research where you can pie combine the results of all these different trials and then you examine all of them you look for problems you kind of reassess all of the data that was supplied and find a common core of data that you can rely on within a sort of fairly strict range they discount tests that obviously have problems or the may have had problems and then they apply statistical analysis techniques to kind of weight the data from one test to another to kind of re-examine the results and the advantage of this approach is that because you have combined all of these different studies together you have a much larger number of overall trials that you can use and therefore the results are much more robust and statistically significant so they're much more reliable and the reason i think is an interesting thing to talk about is that the headline finding from his mehta research is that you can hear or it the study has shown that people do here with the statistical significance small differences between higher sample rates and bit depths and CD quality which and he includes 48 kilohertz in CD quality which is interesting to me because the one thing I personally have heard is 48 kilohertz sounding slightly different to 44.1 yeah absolutely so so so the fact that they're saying that basically either 40 40 40 or 48 versus 96 or higher there is still an audible difference is the fascinating thing about the study but the reason I wanted to talk about it is that since this report has been published I've seen lots and lots of blog posts and kind of comments on forms and all the rest of it of people kind of going well duh we knew that everybody knows that higher sample rates sound better and this just proves it and and that's the bit where I kind of insert the record scratch and sigh hang on we need to think about it a bit over there it's important to remember a few things though here isn't it that it is a meta-analysis and is a statistical the the the data do not necessarily adia to the same testing rules so if you if you go through the the paper in full this a metric ton of statistical analysis and as you said discounting certain tests so I think it's very easy for sort of non science folks to say this this paper proves this or disproves this or whatever whereas as you mentioned before we're really looking for whether something is statistically significant and then that generally pushes more research to take place doesn't it I mean it's not as if this is a sort of the end result you know the the absolute definitive answer as to whether higher sample rates are effective or not yeah this is an instant actually say anything about whether they're better or not what it says is yes the where people report it differences because lots of the studies they didn't there's a very famous study where they had you know high sample rate recordings they played them to people and then they played them same thing just with a high cut filter at 20 kilohertz similar to the type that's used in you know when you're recording for CD or down sampling for CD and people just didn't notice the difference didn't notice those high frequency just disappear and that's often been held up as kind of categorical proof so even when you combine negative studies like that with the positive studies and all the rest of it and you wait all of this data they do find that people are hearing a difference and I think we should probably just mentioned this the percentages right so yeah so if there was no audible difference between higher sample rates and 44.1 or 48 k you would expect over that number of over 12,000 trials or I think actually the only ended up with 400 trials being part of the final data set they decided could be comparable because of all of those variations between the test that you mentioned but even so it's a very large sampling comparison to most tests where it's like 20 or 30 tests you were expected to be 5050 if there was no difference and actually the split was 53 forty-seven percent yes one thing was very interesting in the study that I don't have any issue with at all was that they also analyzed the difference between people who were kind of just regular music listeners people you know who I know about came in off the street but certainly you know weren't trained and in a way to listen to audio or aware in advance of what the differences might be they compared the differences that those people could hear versus people who were trained in the sense that they were played examples and said okay listen here's one thing here's another you can hear the difference and they were given kind of time to acclimatize themselves and then take the test and in that case where people had had a chance to learn what they were listening to the percentage shifted and you had a 60-40 results yeah and I I think that's I see the more interesting phenomenon that's that's been investigated really because if people are educated as to how to hear a specific artifacts then their appreciation enjoyment of what music will change and I wonder whether that's the case for audio pro ohs because you know if you're a mix engineer or a mastering engineer or you know a recording engineer then you you definitely hear music differently recorded music differently and and likewise musicians will hear music differently to your average punter who's a non musician I definitely think it's a factor because I mean I vividly remember the first time I ever compared different mp3 compression codecs yeah way back in the dim and distant past we had a client who wanted us to provide them with mp3 files as well as CD masters mm you know i mean thats nice something these days I just I just won't go there I'm kind of like you know if you want to mp3 your stuff you know that's your lookout but and I mean I have to say most encode is now a far better than they were then but we auditioned four or five different encoders and I remember you know listening back to them on the main monitoring and I was working with Nick Watson back then and we were working on this together and I was kind of like well that one I think sounds pretty good and he looked at me who's up Paul he's like you're kidding he said you know how could that's hideous and I said no it's not it's and I was listen to again and I couldn't understand why he objected it too much and he kind of looked at me he said but but can't you hear the swirling ultrasonic birdies and I kind of looked at him as that he was insane and then I played it back and listen and suddenly I heard you know the kind of familiar that thing where you've actually tend to get it where an encoder is rolling out less of the very high end so there's more high frequency content which is harder for the mp3 encode codec to encode efficiently and use yeah you know that kind of almost like somebody is gently playing the chime bars in the back in the decision and suddenly I could hear what he meant as I you're right and from then on that you know I heard that on everything and it was that process of somebody pointing out to me what you know i was listening to kind of the overall sound and the punch in the base and and i just liked the fact that this particular encode had a bit more top-end in it in comparison to the others but it was anyone I looked at it through that kind of well there weren't any swirling ultrasonic birdies on the original and there are listen I don't like them at all yeah I'm like that description ultrasonic birdie it's good I'm you know I i was doing them a record some years ago and there was a obviously some kind of fault in I'm not really sure I think it was from an old peluso you know the old 47 copy not that old but it had been dropped and it was a punk record a kind of dual mics ladies and gentlemen well yeah absolutely not dropped by myself I was in someone else's studio and it was not dropped by the studio and it was dropped by a visiting engineer unfortunately they hadn't informed the the studio and problem had had occurred in the microphone where there was a sort of ultra high pitched tone around sort of I'd probably like 17 15 17 k now obviously when you smash that through an 1176 with her with an aggressive punk vocal and print out a mix it probably an age-related thing the the frequency was slightly beyond my my range which is kind of normalize you you know you pass into your 30s and the band were all a bit younger and they sent comments back saying home what's what's the what's the sound that the buzzing and I was saying what buzzing do you mean distortion and they didn't have the the knowledge to say oh it's frequency it's this particular frequency so I'm listening for something completely different you know it literally took it took my put in my head up against that put it on in the car and put my head right up against the speaker and full volume you you know in between the in between the vocal tracks to try and hear this frequency I said oh if you tell me it was a high-pitched tone then then we could have saved ourselves a lot of 12 you know my my other half who listens to a lot of my mixes and Paul's faces mostly yes they do you could not believe that I couldn't hear this but I guess it's very much like the old the old golden golden white vs blue and black dress phenomenon isn't it for if you're sort of a non audio person you could probably parallel it with those kind of optical illusions where as soon as you are aware that there is something there you see it or you hear it straight away but until you've been trained to to understand it then then it's quite often difficult to identify that those things are present yeah no I agree and I mean I think before anybody kind of thinks training I'm not cuz we're not talking about you know teaching somebody to be an audio engineer even it's just it's more kind of years of having the thing pointed out to you you know you said they like I mean that the blue and gold dress thing is quite a good example because you know until I read about the controversy if I had seen that dress I mean I was somebody who always saw the dress is gold well that's really interesting because you saw his blades it's blue and black to me but I think I actually it kind of rigorously it is blue and black it's just in that photograph you can see it in the two years because it's a little weird this weird kind of thing that happens in our brains there's you know so yeah it's a fascinating thing I mean maybe that's not the perfect example there are some other kind of easy because because you can always almost hear that two ways you know it's the same as the picture that is it of ours or is it two faces facing each other or does the cube come out with the page towards you or does it go in you know all of those I think that's absolutely right you can it in a sense that you see or hear something just a certain way and then suddenly some tiny little thing can flip it and suddenly you hear something completely different and and that kind of brings us to the Simpsons paradox that was was detailed in the paper as well which is the presence of an unknown variable skewing the results really isn't it so you know that they mentioned several times in the pay in the meta-analysis that there may be other factor is going on yeah well let's pause for a second just so kind of retrace because we went on a slight tangent they're talking yeah how you know constrained listening this but coming back to the fundamental finding the paper did decide you know using scientific analysis that I respect that over all over all of these years and some of these trials go way back yeah and even if you kind of factor in for some of the the kind of the differences that might exist between the tests like even if you exclude the old tests on the basis that may be older digital gear wasn't as good as modern deal to get people can still hear these differences so there definitely is an audible difference between these high sample rate recordings and the low some great recordings so you might be tempted to think from that ball there you go you know if you can hear a difference then obviously nights or 96 and higher sample rates are better but I mean the paper itself lists a number of reasons that could be contributing to the differences that people are hearing that have nothing to do with it actually being higher quality absolutely yeah and I think that's what you're talking about you know it was yeah because I'm you know the one of the key things I thought was that none of these were conducted with headphones oh so you know you're very much at the mercy of the acoustics of the rooms which weren't mentioned at all in the in the meta-analysis as far as I can remember and they might have been but I I don't recall an item's and room acoustics but there's romances as monitors there's so many things yeah but there's monitors I mean there's just the converters that we use I mean well even the digital formats you know I mean because in terms of some of them used sacd the super audio CD format that DSD that i mentioned yes is not as some people think actually fundamentally different from normal PCM it's just that it uses one bit and incredibly high sample rates but I mean effectively you it's functionally equivalent to a think not 196 24 yeah that kind of that kind of ballpark but it includes lots of high frequency noise that actually can mask lot of the high frequency content that might have been there originally then there's 2496 recordings 192 one of the tests was comparing 24-bit with 16-bit recordings and they didn't use dither and oddly enough that was one of the trials that apparently showed quite a strong ability for people to detect the difference and just for anybody who's keeping score I've now had 12 requests for an episode of the podcast on death so i probably will be doing that at some future point so i'm not going to go into that particular a rabbit hole right now and one of my favorites issues that was mentioned but not really kind of addressed in the paper was this thing called intermodulation distortion so i don't think i can adequately explain i'm not even sure I adequately understand how intermodulation distortion to expect but the short version is in a perfect audio system you get in what you put out apart from possibly scaling it with the volume control um there are no systems that are that perfect even a digital system I mean a digital system can approach that kind of level of perfection but certainly an analog system and you know don't forget any any digital system we have has an analog stage at least at the output and at the input so there are always analog electronics involved and they are never perfect some of them get very close to being perfect and some of them are substantially better than others but in general all analog systems will introduce some kind of distortion into the signal be it noise you know kind of a harmonic distortion whatever it might be and you know back in the days when analog consoles were king SSL and everybody else was Nev struggling to minimize those effects when you get that kind of change to the signal and I kind of mentioned this again in the episode i did on distortion you are technically distorting the signal and the signal is what's called nonlinear so in a linear system you get it out a perfectly scaled version of what you put in in a nonlinear system you get most a perfect version of what you put in but not quite and depending on how nonlinear the system is it could be substantially different or it could be very very similar so every system is nonlinear to some degree and what you tend to find is that most systems are much more nonlinear at very low and very high frequencies because understandably the people who build the gear optimize it for you know the audible frequency range the bit that's most important for our ears which most of the evidence seems to suggest is 20 Hertz up to 20 kilohertz absolutely so then the question is how nonlinear does stuff get outside of those frequency ranges and what is the effect of it what you find is that some of this nonlinear distortion that can creep into the signal if there is significant ultrasonic content in the signal meaning above 20 kilohertz the distortion from those signals that are the system you're playing it back on or that you recorded it with can't cope with can be spread across the whole audible spectrum so just because let's say you've got you know something happening up at 32 kilohertz in the audio signal which you know you get that that happens with things like muted trumpet sorprendio percussion instruments you know it's not an uncommon thing even if your system is not capable of reproducing those free consider particularly if your system is incapable of reproducing those frequencies you might still hear something as a result of those frequencies because of these nonlinear distortions these intermodulation distortion in the system and I mentioned this briefly in the analog versus digital episode anybody who's interested in this can and I think actually everybody who's listening to this should test their own system for these problems and I will include in the show notes a link to a blog post that I did which has a link in it to you can download some test files there are three different test files each of which has kind of different types of ultrasonic content in them if you play those test files back on your system if it's working correctly you won't hear anything because they are categorically beyond the frequency where we can hear them there's no signal below 20 kilohertz where we can hear it so if your system is functioning correctly you should not hear these signals what most people will find is that actually they can hear something because most systems are somewhat flawed so you know on these stock output of my macpro I can hear something on one of the DTA converters I have here I can hear something on one of the other ones I can't if i put in a high-quality sample rate converter to reduce things down to so that everything is below 20 kilohertz I can't hear it that's the correct result so there's a simple take a lot of that I guess is about the analog stages and filtering within within your converters yeah what would let's get on the filtering in a sec but absolutely it's and and the thing is it could happen any stage so for example it might happen on the headphone output of your gear but not on the main output to the monitor speakers or vice versa or it might be fine on your converter and in your amplifier but happen in the speakers or it might not happen in speakers but it might happen in the amplifier every separate component in your listening chain after the digital-to-analog converter might be susceptible to this problem and just to kind of before we move on the point about this is if your system makes audible sounds when you play it that ultrasonic content it's possible that when you play high sample rate material that has content that goes up into those ultrasonic frequencies that that is the reason you're hearing a difference not because your system is playing it about better it's just sounding different because actually it's got a little bit of extra distortion in there and I think the other thing to say is that you might prefer it because when most of us expect high sample rate content to have more life and more air in the the signal if you have a tiny little bit of high-frequency distortion in there that's exactly the kind of effect that you here so it is possible that lots of people who have tried comparing 96 with 44.1 or whatever are actually hearing this distortion instead of a genuine more musical you know better recorded signal sure yeah I think you know that with with the sort of plugging of the commercial aspect of high samplerate audio hello Sonia doing a push for hope I think their branding it high definition audio or something like that that they're sort of suggesting that you can hear more detail and as she kind of mentioned that might not necessarily be the case in an obvious way one of the examples that Sony gave on one of their recent videos to plug this new technology at what new technology old technology really was that you would be able to hear a finger brush across a piano key more realistically details that would be lost in in lower quality audio and I think that's true but only to an extent isn't it it's not so much about you own hear this particular nuance it's that the higher frequencies are audible and they will make these things sound specifically different and I guess you know the whole aliasing is is something that might be worth discussing as well yeah we could touch on that so before I forget I think one thing I want to say that I think there's a misconception lots of people expect higher sample rates and a correctly dithered audio versus truncated audio for example to sound tapia to sound clear after Sam my experience is always the exact opposite when I have compared well say for example 48 versus 44.1 where I can hear a difference a small difference and their possible reasons why I could hear the difference but that's the test that I've done I know I can hear or when I compare dithered versus truncated 16-bit audio I think pretty much without exception the the higher quality one sounds smoother to me it actually sounds slightly softer yes sounds yes absolutely and I think that's a key thing to bear in mind because you know the i think in both cases the lower quality signal has been slightly degraded slightly distorted and quite often we perceive that as actually sounding a little bit edgy a little bit brighter a little bit harsher a little bit grittier so you know I think there's a there's a risk of people kind of flip their perception of it and actually you quite often I've read on multiplications people can say oh well I compared the dither than the under that versions and I preferred the one without dither and I'm concerned that the reason they picked that is it just sounded that a little bit kind of yeah grittier and edgier and that they therefore chose a month I technically was yet hyped exactly yeah that was worse so yeah I just wanted to kind of get that in there yeah I mean I went through a phase in probably 20 2008 2009 of making sure everything was 2496 now obviously I in the context of recording then you know I think there was a difference but but in the context of recording this there's practicality measures to to ensure that in terms of you know processing power and a data storage so sound quality is not necessarily the only thing that you have to consider is whether you actually gonna be able to complete a project now in the mastering side of things that's probably less of an issue but it's definitely worth sort of thinking about is to you know there are going to be restrictions and whilst certain things might sound smooth which I think they do certainly 2496 and I listen back to those recordings and that sort of fed you know at CD quality and I think there's a difference even even at that point as well you know that practicality measure is something that needs to be considered as well yeah in terms of I think we can revisit that point kind of you try and sum all of this up because I definitely agree with you that's a factor yeah and you know I think it's worth bearing in mind that you know even if this study even if this kind of research the follows on from this this is paper that we're talking about eventually shows that there really are genuinely audible benefits to the higher sample rates and we can't rule that out I don't have a theoretical reason to think that might be true at the moment that doesn't mean it's not true even if you know they find something real you know you gotta bear in mind that small percentage you know over the whole number of listeners it was kind of fifty three percent in terms of could hear a difference versus forty-seven percent who couldn't you know that's a small number of people hearing a small difference rather than you know if it was a ninety percent ten percent split you'd have something that was clearly better for everybody and we should all be doing it and I'm pretty confident that that's what you get if you tested kind of you know a 22 kilohertz sample rate versus 44.1 yeah kilohertz operate for example but yes when you consider the relatively small number of people who are going to be sensitive to this difference and appreciate it you might want to consider the practicalities of you know like you say bang for your buck absolutely but you mentioned aliasing pacing is obviously a it's a problem that can occur with a digital system if it doesn't have the right filtering in and now we get to the filtering because we've been talking about quite esoteric points like intermodulation distortion than different types of high sample rate format and did the vs. truncation distortion but the kind of the elephant in the room is that the other thing that wasn't common to any of these tests was the converter technology that was used so some of them use the Pacific micro sonics hdcd some of them used prism Commerce's I think that you know the whole range of technology used to convert the digital signals in back into analog and indeed to encode them into digital in the first place and and the kind of the key difference between those different converters is going to be the filtering system that was used because when you record digital you know digital only works if you remove all the frequencies that are above half the sample rate if you're sampling at 44 kilohertz you have to filter out all the above twenty two kilohertz otherwise you will get aliasing distortion which you mentioned and if you wanna preserve that you're right that's technically called the Nyquist frequency if you want to look it up yeah nobody wants to look it up we can include some links in the show notes and this comes from the sampling theorem which you know breach tangent lots of people kind of claim that the fact that high sample rate audio sounds different to lower sample rate audio means that Nyquist must in some way be wrong you know if Nyquist was wrong digital audio itself wouldn't work full stop it's you know all this done we're talking about is based on that theorem the sampling theorem that all the stuff comes from so anyway the point is you have to have these filters and you have to have a filter on the output of a digital to analog system as well on the converters when you play it back and there are various ways of designing those filters so you can have over sampling systems that have been in use since the pretty early days of digital where you actually that the clock in the chip runs at a higher sample rate which means you can use gentler filters so they have less effects you know I mean the point about filters is there is always going to be a compromise you either and they sound so different as well don't they exactly different filters sound completely different depending on how they're engineered some people will go for a very sharp cutoff frequency which will tend to cause more influence on the phase of the audio near the cutoff frequency some people we use you more gentle filters where the phase change effects near the crossover are less but obviously because it's more gentle it extends further down in the frequency range so if you if everything is going to cut off by say 20 kilohertz you know you might start to hear that the effects of that filter as far down as 16 kilohertz so if you compare that with a filter with a sharp cutoff frequency a chances are it would sound a little bit softer in the high frequencies than the filter that had the very sharp cutoff but the one with the red sharp cutoff might have more phase effects and those may or may not be audible so you know you can argue about which is better and how audible in of these effects are but the simple fact is with all of those tests that were there we have no real idea what filtering systems were used whether they were implemented well or not you know i mean it's it's possible that there were design flaws in some of those filters you know just to take a simple example if you this is why different CD players sound different this is why hifi magazines can still make money reviewing zedek because you know that the digital that the digits on every desk are the same in theory it's possible to reproduce identical sounding audio from any CD of that's got the same recording on it or any any digital file in practice exactly how the the analog circuitry in the piece of gear works will cause differences and of course one of the most blatant ones is level differences that's another thing that wasn't you kind of accounted for in this in the matter study I mean they mention it as a factor and and I think you know the point is all of those factors they mentioned are reasons for future research because you would hope that the people who did those tests very carefully level matched all of their comparison examples so that that wasn't going to be a factor in what people heard but we don't know for certain whether or not that was done in any case absolutely i mean the the information off about durations of playback and rest periods between playback and equipment and so on they weren't complete for a lot of the lot of the studies as far as um joshua could only find out a certain amount of information so they were losing different tests you know some of them have yeah absolutely some of them had tests were using test tones some of them they all had different objectives and all of that is discussed very thoroughly in the paper but i think you know yeah you know if we start to wrap this up what we're saying is the paper does show that there are audible differences in systems that record at different sample rates yeah but it doesn't say anything about where those differences come from and it might be that those differences come genuine musical benefits of recording those higher frequencies that we think we're pretty confident nobody can hear as kind of paradox because that seems you know you can't rule that possibility out but before you reach that conclusion there are a ton of different things that need to be investigated like probably most fundamentally just the different converters we used in the different filters and the way they were implemented and whether or not any of those systems were susceptible to intermodulation distortion and whether different types of material are more revealing of any differences or not whether they were there and whether or not there were proper systems of loudness matching used in the trials and whether the amplification and reproduction systems and the acoustics that you mentioned you know that's that's an awful lot more science if I'm a surgeon needs to be done that's right the average sort of engineer can almost do their own tests obviously you can be thrown somewhat and convince yourself of one thing or another but if if you were if you're careful it's quite possible to to like you said about the mp3 encoders it's quite possible to implement your own a B comparisons in the studio and you know if you can find someone else to do that with you so you can do it blind then you know there are there are various options there I mean I would say the only issue there is is the reset time because it's very easy to forget what something sounds like isn't it well that's interesting that we should probably mention that quickly because one of the things that came out of this meta study was that there was also as well as finding that people who had had the chance to learn what these audio signals sounded like were better at detecting the differences it also found that or it seemed to show that people who listened to longer samples at 20 or 30 seconds long and then had a rest in between them actually were slightly better at detecting the differences than people who did shorter instant a B tests which I found fascinating something I've heard mentioned before and actually flies I mean it's the the International Telecommunications Union the ITU the you know that the AES and everybody else liaise with their recommendation is actually for no longer than 10 or 15 samples Satan samples yes when you're doing these kind of tests because they're concerned about listener fatigue so I've found that a fascinating well there are certain differences that I know from my own experience our best heard with an a/b you know I mean you know the perception the plug in the eye design is is kind of all about a/b testing with loudness compensation and yeah for me you know when I use it I find there are all kinds of differences that suddenly leap out at me when things have been loud and smashed and when I can seamlessly and instantly switch from one to the other having said that there have been other occasions where I've been hey be testing things and you kind of go ear blind we just need to lose your perspective and you just kind of sit there and let it run for a bit and then flick back to the other one it's only go oh and feel like so I guess that's an instinct that I've had you know sometimes that listening to longer samples can be more revealing and it was quite fascinating to find that actually there's some experimental evidence for that yes yeah absolutely I think it's a tricky one isn't it to to quantify and again that's a whole other area of study isn't it as to how the psycho acoustics of this whole thing function and and you know it depends what you're looking for I'm so i guess the itu-r have a very specific intent in what they want to to look at so you're absolutely right people can do their own tests if anybody listening to this if you want to do your own tests to try and decide whether you can hear the difference between a high sample rate recordings and kind of normal 44.1 or 48 kilohertz hundred recordings I just want to give you a few guidelines the first thing you need to do is to go to the blog post that I'm going to put in the show notes where you can get those sample files and check your system for intermodulation distortion because if your system can't play back those ultrasonic samples cleanly meaning you play it back at your normal listening level and you don't hear a thing and incidentally you need to kind of start and stop the files because quite often our ears become immune to steady-state noise so you're sitting there listening to this thing play and you think now I can't hear anything and then you you know suppress stop and suddenly you can you just that tiny little difference if your system is vulnerable to those kind of issues it's not necessarily a problem but you can't make any hard and fast conclusions about the quality of high sample rates because it's probably caused by an intimate relation distortion so stage one rule that out then if you're going to do any comparisons you need to make sure that they are perfectly loudness matched we shouldn't be an issue the final thing is to only do your tests at the high sample rate so let's say you're comparing 96 kilohertz with 44.1 you need to take your 96 kilohertz file which needs to have some frequency content above 20 kilohertz you know you need to run an analyzer and just check that there's something going on up there otherwise you're not testing what you think you are necessarily although that's a whole other area of research we all go down that rabbit hole so you've got your sample it's got some ultrasonic content in it use a really high-quality sample rate converter to convert it down to 44 kilohertz then you need to upsampling back to 96 kilohertz or whatever your higher sample rate is because some converters will sound different at different sample rates simply because of the way they're designed so that's another factor you could conceivably be hearing differences simply because of the way your converter works for example it might use a different type of filter or a different filtering circuit at one sample rate versus another and that can introduce a difference that doesn't actually have anything to do with the signal you're playing back it's just a design aspect so you can rule that out by doing all your tests and ninety-six killers up sampling from 44.1 296 will have no audible benefit but it won't or it shouldn't degrade the signal either if you're using a high quality converter so when you do your comparison your replay system stays at 96 kilohertz the whole time but you're comparing the 96 kilohertz with the upsampled 44.1 if you've got all of those things in place level matched no intermodulation distortion same sample rate for playback even though you're comparing them separate then you have a fair test and then if you can hear a difference maybe you're hearing the benefits of high sample frequencies and i would like to say if anybody listening to this does those tests if you do this test and genuinely feel you're hearing a difference I would love it if you would drop me an email and maybe we can all go and pay a visit to hear the visit the studio of the people who can hear well I want it I want to hear it on my own system first and then if I can hear a difference and I agree with you that's when it starts getting really interesting um I'm not sure that will get enough numbers for this to be generally but I mean that kind of gives you an example of how careful you have to be when you're doing these kind of test you know even a simple test what seems like a simple test for us you have to be so careful and then when you go into the whole kind of making sure that listening is blind and double blind and all of those other factors it's it's so easy to see why there are still so many variables in the scientific research why we can't just jump to the conclusion that so many people are jumping to when they read this paper that oh there you go I told you you know I've always knew I could hear the difference as you say it may be that your converters to sound better at whatever circuit they're using at 96 or whatever in in a practical example of that you know i was using radar systems for recording several records and they were limited to 44.1 for some reason and you know those converters sound absolutely wipes the floor with certain other converters yeah or the high-end converters but ones may be working at 48 so or 96 even it's so very much it's down to the analog side of things whether they're designed to work effectively with the Digital side in in that specific instance and of course I suppose we all have to remember that you know most of our records are going to be listened to on our earbuds and mobile phones so maybe that's something to bear in mind as to how they're going to deal with with higher higher sampling rates yeah I'm completely in the future it might be a good point to finish on is people might think listening to this that I'm kind of saying oh no hi sample rates are pointless that's not the case all I'm saying is that even with this new study the issue is not settled you know it's an open question and if people want to know my advice of course the answer is it depends there's some easy answers if your system is vulnerable to intermodulation distortion I recommend you avoid high sample rates because if it's showing those kind of problems on playback it may well be vulnerable to them on the record side as well and in that case I just genuinely don't see a benefit of doubling the bandwidth of your you know doubling the size of your recording audio files for something that is not genuinely better if your systems not vulnerable to intermodulation distortion and you would like to record a 96 kilohertz why not I mean Don Lavery who's the guy behind you know that Lavery Lavery converters someone some of the best converters out there has written about this and in his opinion I think it's 60 kilohertz would be an ideal sampling rate I think he feels that the you know particularly in terms of including factors like kind of making things cost effective bang for your buck efficiency all the rest of it if the system reproduces everything up to 30 kilohertz right half the sample rate accurately that's sufficient that nobody will ever hear a significant difference but you don't you save yourself a whole load of engineering headaches you know and that's that's the sweet spot and unfortunately we don't have that as an option for sample rates I mean you know 48 kilohertz is closed 50 vs 60 you know you might argue there's not a huge difference 96 is probably overkill 192 is definitely overkill I genuinely don't see any benefit to that but if people want to be future proof and the system isn't vulnerable to intermodulation distortion then you know why not well that was the other point how is going to mention yeah we with data being so store data storage being so cheap at the moment and it will get cheaper and cheaper obviously according to Moore's law the reasons for storing that kind of data are reducing but I guess when you think of it on a global scale you know that the whole thing scales up dramatically well if you're if it's if you're talking about a you know 24-track mix maybe the data to that huge but if it's if it's 32 if it's 64 tracks or you know hundred 100 yeah you know that's it can can you run you know unless you've got a DSP systems and there's a lot of people working native these days then even with a DSP system running 128 tracks of heavily processed mix at you know 2496 is a serious undertaking and you're quite often run out of voices or you know your your your CPU will start to struggle especially as people are working in a way where they they want to kind of merge the mixing and and recording stage so you know with dropping plugins in during the tracking you're starting to really sort of push the system absolutely well in a special but even with some DSP systems like people who use the universal audio stuff yeah you know I think there are situations where those can start to run out of processing power and at that point I think you would have to kind of think yourself is the trade-off worthwhile you know it's again it's kind of cost versus benefit I'm going to get to the mastering Maxim in a second which people will probably not be very surprised by but let's just put our cards on the table Russell do you cord hi sample rates I tend to go 48 k 24 bit yeah I'll I'll occasionally push it to 96 if it's something that I think might be called upon for broadcast or DVD but for most of the rock stuff that I do I'm 2496 sorry 24 48 is where I'm at usually yeah that's cool and now I feel mean because actually I can't put my cards on the table because the honest answer is I'm actually not doing any tracking these days if I do I go to a studio and there I will go with whatever the engineer prefers because it's genuinely not worth getting into an argument with somebody who feels passionately about this stuff and if if I had to make a judgment call I honestly I would have to do the tests that I'm talking about here you know so five or six years ago I did some tests and that was when i discovered that i could hear a difference between a 48 k and a 44-point 1k recording that might well have been down to filter design and all limitations in the playback technology I don't know but I do know that I heard a difference it was small you know it was one of those kind of less than 1% differences but I could hear it blind I couldn't hear the difference with the material i was using on the system that i was using which was very good between 96 and 48 so at that point you know that kind of underlies my opinion until now but it's been so long and I think now know so much more about the topic i think i would want to i would want to redo those test myself i think i think you're very right in the 44.1 and 48 or noticeably different even I mean do you I mean I guess the thing is I guess 48 makes you I don't know it's all I'm gonna say future-proof big but I mean at least you can supply you know broadcasters at 48 DVD has quickly support 48 kilohertz so in that sense because I mean one argument would be well what's the point of even recording 48 because the vast majority of stuff you know all the damn cords CDs downloaded files almost all of them run at 44 killers yeah you know is and and then you're introducing an extra layer of sample rate conversion I think you do it well can sound perfect or damn near perfect but if the converter you're using is not optimal even that can introduce a little bit of degradation so I mean there's swings and roundabouts whichever way you look at it yeah I think there's a lot of even independent artists who are being given the option by their aggregators to supply high-res files and 48 24 bit um sort of hits that it's that that criteria i think in fact there's a definition by one of the american industry bodies for high-definition audio and i think it is you I think it's 20 bit it's considered high definition and I believe 48 as opposed to 44.1 is considered high definition so but yeah you're absolutely right i mean itunes is the obvious one where they encourage you to send files at the highest possible resolution yeah so very quickly my mastering maxim i feel a bit of a cheat because i think i've already done this one in different aspects in different episodes but the maximum is to stop worrying about sample rate you know if you're interested you can do the test you can test the system for intermodulation distortion and you can do your own comparisons of different sample rates and make your mind up that way but if you have a system that's working where you get fantastic sounding results I genuinely don't think switching up the sample rate is going to be the thing that makes the difference for you you should be doing spending money on installing more acoustic treatment or possibly on better monitoring or a great pair of headphones or a really nice new mic all of those things again have a much bigger impact on the final sound of your recording than whether you work at 44.1 or 96 kilohertz in my opinion based on what I've heard over the years and bearing in mind that I haven't and the test myself for about five six years that wasn't the snappiest was it I'll just repeat that the maxim is stop worrying about the sample rate there are more important things in life like tuning guitars and where you put the mic and getting a great performance and all that kind of stuff absolutely and it totally spelt on there thank you very much for us I've enjoyed this and we got pretty nerdy in the middle of that so that's going to be a test for you guys out there listening I'll be interested to see whether you love this or whether we went beyond the pale in this episode but I do think it's a nice to kind of tackle a current issue and and kind of really dig into this topic so if people want to find out more about you and what you're doing where can they go online um

other interesting thing I wanted to say about that is I've kind of been you know keeping an eye on conversations that happen in that facebook group a you know a good number of those engineers hang out most of the topics there are unrepeatable on this project because we don't get explicit content ready but there are a couple of passionate advocates of high sample rate recording there but there are a lot of people who basically say I just don't care you know there's just a feature on my radar you know and these are these are working pros producing some of the biggest names in the industry you know some some genuine legends in there who you know just it's like yeah well I do this but it's it's not a big issue for me so it just kind of reinforces that that message I think from the maxim does they

review|Finder X1|Explorer|hi res,2020-10-07 10:14:20.653486," Hale hero s reviews you're watching our hands-on review of the echo box titanium Bluetooth earphones they're also known as the GI 22 BT and they sell for a hundred bucks now this is a company that specializes an audiophile grade so high res audio certified headphones and earphones and this is one of their first Bluetooth or wireless models now this is a competitor to brands like one more which is more well known right now because they have partnerships with Xiaomi but this company also has a similar mission of trying to deliver audiophile grade products at more affordable prices to consumers so here's our website this is the first time that I'm checking out one of their products so I'm also curious to see whether the performance will deliver it seems like they're based out of California and these are some of their models you can see most of these are all inline style headphones and earphones because that still gives you the highest resolution traditionally speaking with music so again this is one of their first Wireless models as claims to be the world's first titanium driver earphones and also comes with comply foam tips which are like memory foam and they fit more snugly into your ears again they sell for 99 bucks on Amazon right now it's priced a little higher on their website but again it's on sale typically for under a hundred and otherwise here are some basic specs has eight hours of battery life which is about average and this is the packaging itself comes in two colors black and white we have the white model here frequency range of 20 to 20,000 Hertz 6 millimeter driver and bluetooth with aptX which has lower latency but it's bluetooth version 4.1 as opposed to bluetooth 5.0 which is the latest standard kind of wish they would have used that but anyways in the packaging here says made for music bill for life so we've got the wireless earbuds themselves wrapped up pretty carefully let's remove the plastic here and we have the inline remote we'll take a closer look at the design in a moment we also have access to the product manual which is documenting kind of all the features how to clean it the inline remote control and also a warranty card we also have a quick user guide for the comply foam tips that they're using and the tips are all contained in a small little pouch that you can use to carry it with you and on the go regular silicon chips which are round we also have the winked tips for sticking into your years more smugly when performing sports or going to the gym we also have the complied tips and these are from the isolation series which are trying to block as much noise as possible through passive noise isolation again these aren't active noise-cancelling headphones and how you wear these is basically you squeeze them shut and then you put them into your ears and they will slowly expand to fill in kind of the grooves of your years to get a more comfortable fit this is a micro USB charging cable alright so let's take a closer look at the design of the echo box titanium Bluetooth earphones first it does have a pretty typical design in shape as far as wireless earbuds are concerned very sport like and we just have a again titanium housing here which is extremely sturdy and weighty feeling so these are definitely not light your buds in fact you can definitely feel the heft but again it feels quite solid we have the rubber wing attached by default in addition to a silicon tip left and right labels and then the echo box logo printed on the plates of the your tips there the remote contains a microphone for answering phone calls works with both iOS and Android as well as the power on and off button which is in the center you can tap on this for a few seconds longer to enter the pairing mode and there's an LED on the front that will start to flash to indicate that you can kind of start pairing it we also have the volume controls up and down which works pretty well once paired the middle button acts as a play/pause key for media and you can double tap to kinda answer or reject a phone call now one thing I will say is that the remote here is made out of plastic completely and what looks like metal on the top is still just painted plastic since this is a really kind of premium Wireless Yurbuds I do wish that they would have made the remote out of metal maybe aluminum as well there is plenty of attention to detail such as the echo box logo printed gently on the silicon tips in addition to the wire which is actually made out of a braided material that's a more wear resistant moving to audio quality and performance I would say that the sound signature is neutral so just like other IEMs it is more tuned for precise and accurate music listening rather than consumer headphones typically having more bass boosted sound what I mean is if you are you know really into EDM you or bass boosted tracks you will feel a little disappointed because in comparison with the one more triple drivers I would say the bass on these are definitely not as powerful and even after playing around with the equalizers but what you will have is a great amount of detail in the mids and highs that is you know extremely precise and if you're listening to folk music or acoustic music that's when it really just sounds very impressive so if you are listening to some high res audio tracks maybe an L doc were encoded in flack you definitely will hear a difference with these comparative sheep or your buds there's a ton ton more nuance that you can tell with the vocals in addition to the instrumentals you can almost feel all the layers it's also very dimensional sounding so if you are listening to a track that is recorded using multiple microphones or if you're watching a movie soundtrack you can definitely hear very precisely and very obviously as objects move around in the space so as you close your eyes it's a very immersive experience I was also a little surprised with the latency because it's really good for Bluetooth 4.1 earphones these might be the best I've tested yet because playing and pausing tracks really quickly in between I don't really hear any popping and the sound is synced up completely with the video so the audio and the video are kind of perfectly in sync which means watching videos is still very enjoyable some photo observations now I wouldn't say that they are the cleanest sounding earphones in the world because at the end of the day there's still wireless Bluetooth so if you listen really closely you can still hear a very faint hiss a slight buzz in the background it really doesn't distract from the music that much especially as you get immersed within the sound you kind of forget about it but it's not quite as silent as on regular 3.5 millimeter wired earphones where you don't get any of that digital noise or distortion in the background at all so that's pretty much it as far as our hands-on review of the echo box titanium bluetooth in your headphones overall for the price I would say they are solid but they're also not the best value in the world sure they sound really good especially for vocals mids and highs are extremely detailed and precise and for Bluetooth 4.1 headphones the lates latency is also extremely good but the dilemma is for most folks are Sports headphones for exercise purposes they aren't gonna be listening to music all that super closely and they would probably prefer something with more volume and more bass and ironically enough you can find a lot cheaper headphones for those purposes but if you are sitting down and listening really closely then sure these do pack more clarity then again more generic brands that you'll find however you will be paying more of a premium price to get that enhanced sound quality so whether that's worthwhile to you will be again up to your personal tastes and preferences for me it was an interesting introduction to echo box and I wasn't left feeling disappointed I think the construction quality really is top-notch and the overall sound quality is also pretty good especially again if you're listening to acoustic tracks or vocal tracks and this is a nice pair of wireless headphones to consider so you can find out more details in the links down below but for now that's been our video thanks for watching here are OS reviews that's been the echo box wireless Bluetooth with titanium earbuds"

283,GI3HzoALJjM,Noah Palermo,UCVhfK1lJMvDFY-GG31_Jxig,Dedicated Audio Player in 2019? - iHaper Lossless Audio Player Review,"NOTE: I've been informed that many phones can also play .flac files. In that case the only downside of a phone would potentially be the DAC (or lack of headphone jack altogether), for which there are also work-arounds... along with the fact that most people are probably better off just using their phone anyway. In that light I think you should not but this audio player unless you have some use for a dedicated player that also needs to be hi-res.

Chances are, when you want to listen to music you reach for your phone and open the Spotify app. But there's a whole world of hi-res audio, in which dedicated audio players are still relevant. In today's video, I review a lossless audio player from iHaper and give my thoughts on who should be buying it.

player|hi-res audio player|.flac player,2020-10-07 10:14:20.653554, what's up guys my name is Noah and in 2019 when you want to listen to music you're most likely going to reach for your phone and a pair of basic headphones maybe even Bluetooth headphones and I think the last thing on people's mind is having the best sound quality possible because as long as it sounds decent most people are gonna be fine with that and I think that's evidenced by the fact that you see many many people using the earbuds which came with their phone but today I'm gonna be talking about a device for those people who really really want the best possible sound quality possible and are willing to go to the extent of using an mp3 / I guess flak audio player so it technically will be higher quality than mp3 but that's essentially what it is is a dedicated audio player you can plug in some very high quality headphones and get super great sound quality out of it so today I'm going to be reviewing this high resolution audio player from hyper before we go ahead and jump into reviewing the audio player I would like to mention that I did set up an Instagram for this YouTube channel put the at right there it's just at no employer my YT so I'll go ahead and follow me over there I will be hosting some giveaways other things on there in the future I have a 1000 subscriber giveaway coming up we'll get more details in a future video that will be held on the Instagram page so go ahead head over there and follow that and you might actually see some extra behind-the-scenes stuff and other pictures and stuff as well so if you've seen any of my other videos about headphones you will have heard me say that I am NOT a big audiophile and I'm not one of those people that cares excessively about sound quality as long as it sounds good it's got good bass mids and highs I'm gonna be fine with it and I think that that goes for most people but that does not prevent me from being able to appreciate a whole other level of sound quality maybe not on the same level of somebody whose ears are tuned to that but I can definitely appreciate it when you get the I hyper audio player that will come in a simple white box inside that will give you a USB type-c charging cable which I really love it does come pre-installed with a micro SD card and then obviously I had fun Jack there for your headphones so it's not a super complicated product it just comes with what you need to get started but I do definitely appreciate the fact that it comes with the micro SD card pre-installed when you turn it on you are greeted with the user interface and this is probably my first guy about it and I don't think the user interface is as polished as it could be and I think it's a little bit confusing for your average everyday person to go through that being said I do think that the target audience for this product will probably be more okay with the slightly more confusing and clunky interface than average everyday people so I don't know if that's necessarily a problem for most people but just overall I think they could have improved the polish of the interface maybe added a little bit more to the animation side of things so it's easy to tell what's happening because right now it kind of just feels like you're going through menus that aren't ordered you kind of just like it doesn't feel like there's really an order to it it's a little bit confusing but that's really the only thing about that user interface which I don't like next up I do want to go ahead and talk about the audio files that this is going to be playing for you it does play flak or FLAC as opposed to mp3 I'm not sure if it actually does work with mp3 I would guess it probably does but it is made for flak audio files I'll go ahead and put a little graphic right here about kind of like the difference between mp3 and flak because it's kind of hard to understand differences in resolution and audio unless you're somebody that knows kind of like what that looks like so it's essentially kind of like video where you've got pixels and then you can add more pixels to have a sharper and cleaner looking image more detail same thing goes for audio and I think that's what flak most of its benefits over mp3 are are in the kind of the detail and the resolution kind of section of the sound quality and I think that to fully appreciate that you really do need a nice pair of headphones I was almost gonna test this out with a pair of Bose over ear headphones but the guy that was gonna let me borrow his did actually bring the wrong aux cord it was a 2.5 millimeter as opposed to 3.5 so that was a little bit frustrating I didn't quite get to testing this out with higher quality headphones but I just tested it out with the headphones which I use every day which I know most people if you or audio files or you really know about sound quality you're gonna be mad at me for this but I just tested it out with these AKG earbuds I think they're like $100 pair of headphones just earbuds and that's really the main thing is that they're earbuds so they're not gonna have the same quality as over here headphones so even though they may not have been as high-quality as other headphones I was definitely able to notice that this has very very good sound quality and very good detail now how much of a step-up it is over something like my phone that's debatable I didn't notice a giant step up but there's definitely some kind of step up I think for most people they're probably not going to notice but in terms of evaluating this on what it's marketed as it does everything that it's marketed as I think it's a nice touch that it has good build quality and that it's made all out of aluminum it's got the USB type-c I think that's all a bunch of nice touches but it does what it's marketed to do it plays a high resolution audio files and from what I've been able to tell it has good battery life as well so I think it does everything that I hate for markets it as being able to do and in that regard I think it's a good product I don't know if the $80 price tag is necessarily a good deal when it comes to these kind of audio players but if you're somebody who's looking at buying this and you're wondering whether or not it works and does this job definitely does for most people though I don't know how much of a step up over over your phone with normal headphones you're really going to notice so in that case I'm not sure I'd recommend everybody spending 80 bucks on this but if you do know what you're getting into it's definitely a good product and I would recommend it as a high-resolution audio player for the target audience alright so that's about it for today's video guys thanks for watching if you have any comments or questions about the eye hamper audio player feel free to drop those down in the comments below along with any suggestions for future videos or how to improve my overall video quality in general and like always guys thanks for watching and I'll catch you guys to the next video peace [Music]

10:14:20.653645," [Music] you with how to AV dot TV / IRC 2018 and we're joined by Hugo Fitz John of Meridian audio and we're here today to talk about high resolution audio in the home you go you've just come out of your first training session for CDA how is that yeah is really good really great to see a lot of people coming out and learning about high res audio and the benefits is gonna have for them in the future so we know what audio is high resolution audio we still relatively new tell us what what the differences in the up quality well for a long time we've been looking at CD as being the kind of benchmark for good quality audio what we've really need for our brains to really understand stuff and it seem more natural is higher resolutions so we need to capture timing information which is really important to actually how we hear stuff so let's talk about the source first of all so we're used to using CD we used to is in mp3 yes what's that source first of all gonna be for high res audio so for high res audio it's going to lightly be streaming source that's one of the main things have been talking about today but also you can have high resolution files which you may be download onto a hard drive when you're going to send to a streamer or play directly from your from your computer well the hardware is it different amplification is it different loud speakers yeah absolutely there's the Jacana audio Society have created a stem which says high res audio and that's a standard which spells out the requirements of the equipment so you need to have electronics which go up to 40,000 kilohertz transducers so the actual tweeters and speakers need to be able to capable of that as well and the hardware needs to be capable of doing 96 24 kilohertz for it to be certified as high res so let's talk about distribution with regards to K rool sure it's no issue with hard-wired cable but if we want to go over Ethernet or we want to go wireless what do we need to consider well I mean it's it's if you've got a good network in place you're probably not going to have any problem there are technologies now there's a encoding format called ngi which allows CD sized files to be streamed but contain the 5s audio information if it gets the MQA decoder and folds the whole picture and that allows you to hide high-res but just with a CD size file and what about Wi-Fi can we send it over wireless yeah absolutely there's plenty of products out there now that are sending CD quality files over Wi-Fi so yeah sure and what transmission are we using for that is it is it a receiver within the loudspeakers or are we using a special high resolution receiver well we're gonna have to have like I said before the 96 24 Hardware actually built into the product to be able to have that high resolution audio going through and it's about having the whole chain of high res capable kind of like if you're going to try and playing and some high bass video if you've got a 4k source and you put it into say a 720p TV we know that's not going to work so anything that's in the audio chain that isn't high res capable that's gonna acts as a roadblock for a high res audio to get through and of course the question mark with regards to high resolution with regards to video and 4k uhd is always about bandwidth all their concerns with high res audio or is it going to run through no problem well I mean it should run through no problem I know we've been looking at streaming stuff from the internet and internet speeds generally are increasing for everybody around the world now so streaming CD quality files is no longer a problem but just to sort of put it into context it's a stream of CD quality file you're looking around about 700 kilobytes per second if it's encoded at flack with UHD so 16 16-bit 24 frames a second 4 4 4 chroma UHD content you're looking 17 point 8 2 gigabytes per second so in the industry we're used to dealing with high speed of data transfer what we're talking about doing the high res audio is peanuts by comparison so if we're considering putting a high res audio system into the home whether it's for ourselves or as an installer what are the key points that we need to consider in order to make sure we've got a great system well I think as I said before it's got a idea to the high resolution audio standard and you've got to have all of your your bits in alignment so you've got a streamer which is got services which have the ability to have high res on them or files from the computer and then a whole chain all the way through right through to the speaker making sure the speaker's capable of high res at 40 kilohertz more great tips for all of our CD members and all of our viewers on how to AV you go think of your time we look forward to even more information from Hugo and from meridiem coming your way soon join us again soon on how to AV TV [Music] you [Music]"

this rolling but I got a whole lot of videos to crank out hopefully for this year and including my 2016 army final product of the year that's gonna be coming very soon so make sure I'll keep a lookout but today I actually have an unboxing video of a product I have been wanting to listen to for a long time ever since a very good guy like generally good hearted guy's name is Anne Mathis on hit by and he's finally started himself a YouTube channel to do some review so I highly recommend checking out his reviews as well I'll of course leave a link to his channel in description box down below but a product he's been talking very very highly of and I finally got my hands on one is the Cayenne I 5 this is a lossless music player that either has been actually be seeing really high praise on the audio community's Cayenne was also nice enough to send it out with a active case so to keep it safe and it's actually a really nice leather and I'll open that one first I think it looks really nice but starting with the packaging so from the front I like it just shows the product has a little bit going on in the background not too awful much it says never be the same again the interesting actually kind of makes me excited to chest out and see what it means by that the back does have quite a bit going on I'm so as you look at the back that shows that has the aka Kim aka 4490 dak which is actually the exact same deck that's in my my Bifrost 4490 so I'm really cute interesting in trying and comparing these two together so I can get this sound on a mobile platform Bango um but without further ado let's just jump into it let's just see how it looks l we but as I said I was gonna open the play carrying case first did y'all brought a suspense so the carrying case is a really nice leather it actually feels very similar to that of my luxury precision l3 this is a nice Brown has Cayenne written on the back with obviously pre-cut outs for the buttons now we'll jump into the open in the Cayenne okay now chill hold your horses we're getting there in you okay so has a really nice box with just Cayenne written right here and a little I guess frequency response written here actually what would be cool I just know if it's true or not but what would be cool is if you said Cayenne and this is the frequency response that would be like Cayenne that would be kind of cool I don't know if it is like that but that would be a pretty cool touch alright so here you have the warranty and warranty manual I think it's huge oh I didn't even mentioned this is an android-based da p you can actually download apps such as title or pin or music app it's an Android based digital audio player so that has really intrigued me so I don't know if it's Wi-Fi enabled well obviously it'll have to be but I'm really excited to see and check out the functionality of this let's see open here and add some weight to it that doesn't feel cheap by any stretch of that imagination it has a gorgeous and very luxurious like a brownish goldish color to it hmm it kind of has a really trippy but really nice back so my camera gonna show it but the letters the way the background is here and the letters it just kind of looks like it's floating the well the was called the illusion it's presenting is that the words are floating on nothing with how the back is that is that's a really cool touch see if the powers on so we've got a bit of a start up to it it's not a very fast start up time but I actually expected that with it being an Android player I'm not being a really Swift and quick

Today I'm taking a look at the iHaper HP1 Hi-Res audio player (sometimes referred to as a FLAC player). This is a relatively low cost audio player capable of outputting music at 192kHz/24bit using a AK4376 DAC. It's an interesting gadget aimed at the budding audiophile.

welcome back to budget buys now today I'll be taking a look at the I hyper HP one this is a high resolution audio player sometimes refer to as a flak player and it was provided free of charge for this review from the folks over at I Hebert now I know what some of you are thinking why does a dedicated audio player even matter in this day and age especially since smartphones fill that niche perfectly that point is especially driven home now that Apple has discontinued every version of the iPod outside of the iPod Touch which admittedly is basically a smartphone without the ability to make calls and the answer to that is simple there are plenty of situations where you want to listen to music podcasts audiobooks etc and you don't quite want to bring your phone with you I know I'd rather not risk damaging my phone at the gym or running or anything like that so yeah there's definitely still a place for dedicated audio players now in the run-up to this video I actually did a good bit of digging into the third-party audio player market and things got kind of interesting now admittedly you could go out and buy yourself a generic mp3 player for between five and twenty dollars and it'll be perfectly fine to use however it will not be high-resolution in fact there's a bit of a format war going on right now in the high res market and as such you can find devices with tons of different features across an entire spectrum of prices the price range I was seeing for lossless audio players goes from between fifty dollars and several hundred dollars heck if you really have deep pockets Sony actually has one out that costs a little over a grand and to be perfectly honest I don't see myself ever needing something that pricey for this purpose but let's say my channel got to a hundred thousand subscribers maybe I'll pick one up and review it until then I'm gonna stay away that being said let's dive into this little guy I'll go ahead and pull it out of the box which loves to stay shut there we go and ain't it cute now if you're wondering where the hp1 sits on that pricing scale I mentioned earlier it actually Lan's itself only lower-cost end of the market bringing in at only $70 now I know that's a bit more expensive than the other items I've been covering on this series but taking into account what it is and what they typically run it's definitely a budget buy worthy product even better despite a lower price point than a lot of the other lossless audio players on the market they really didn't cut corners when it comes to features all right I've got it out of a box so let's take a closer look at these features first and foremost I want to point out that it has a really nice full metal body with some really interesting geometry on it I like the beveled edges that oppose each other I'm kind of a sucker for a symmetrical design what can I say next up is the glass faceplate which looks really nice though admittedly it is a magnet for finger prints so you might want to keep a wipe with you and as for the controls what you have are three faced buttons a power button at the top along with a recessed reset switch and a multi-purpose analog wheel I really dig this actually because I am a sucker for analog controls now on the bottom what we have is the headphone jack a micro SD card which this came packaged with an 8 gigabyte card though it does support up to 128 gigabytes I actually tested it using the card in my camera as well as a USB C port for charging and transferring data and speaking of charging this claims to completely charge within one and a half hours though admittedly I never did run the battery down all the way mainly because it claims to have a 20 hour playback time and I didn't want to leave it running that long in fact thinking of the playback time that's another reason why a dedicated audio player still has a place in today's society because you can listen to 20 hours of music without having to worry about your phone dying on you and the last feature I want to talk about before we get into the operations side of things is the DAC mainly because I have seen this question pop up several times in other flat player review comment sections the DAC in this little guy is the a k4 376 which claims I'll put music at 192 kilohertz 24-bit aka Studio quality of one of the highest grades anyway let's turn this on and show you how to work this thing shall we first off we hold the top button down for a couple of seconds and that powers us on let's let it go through the loading screen oh it looks like it remembers the last song I was on which is a great feature remembers my last song and place so if I'm listening to something long like a podcast or an audiobook I'm safe anyway what we have here is a back button so let's use that to get to the main menu there we go now here we have a forward and back button both for navigating the tracks as a skip or if you do a long press it will actually scroll through the song itself as for the multifunction scroll wheel you use that to navigate this menu here so let me go ahead and just bring it back to these songs and I'll talk about some of the other features in a second there we go music press it inward to select and that also operates as your play pause button there we go as you can see I'm apologizing in advance for all of the camera shaking that's gonna happen so actually let's pick this up and play again now let's navigate back one more time to talk about two pretty unique features because actually let's go back to the song one more time and show you that this scroll wheel when you're in the song actually is used to control the volume you can see the volume indicator right there hopefully this new camera is picking that up and well it has a setting between 0 and 31 which admittedly doesn't sound like much of a sweep on the volume but if I go here and I'm navigating all of this through my viewfinder here huh play settings you'll find a pretty unique feature amp level there we go it has between 1 and 14 for the amp level which actually gives you even more control over the volume I'm just gonna leave it at 7 though it seems to be doing well for me back up to the menu to show you one more feature that you have on this that not every one of the cheapo mp3 players I've checked out in the past have and that is an equalizer this is a seven band equalizer with seven different presets as well as the ability to do your own which is really nice typically I go without a preset though just because I like listening to music as it was originally designed I'm not trying to be pretentious there I just really haven't found a preset that I like also if you hit the top button while it's turned on what that does is lock the player so you don't accidentally navigate while it's in your pocket and now that I've shown you the inner workings of this little guy let me make the case for the improved audio quality because I'm far from an audiophile and even I noticed that there is a distinct improvement when you're jumping from a CD quality audio track to a studio audio quality track now want to preface this by saying pretty much every review I've ever come across for audiophile grade audio has been kind of lacking the way they described the audio is being bigger and to be perfectly honest until I experienced it for myself that meant nothing to me and because most of you still haven't experienced it it probably means nothing to you so let's see if I can put this into words now I wasn't using audiophile grade headphones instead I was trying things out with a couple pairs of monitors I have both over ear and in-ear just to see how things measure up and to be perfectly honest I feel like the flat profile on the monitors really did point out the differences and I finally understand what people mean when they say it sounds bigger and it's not in a grandiose sense it's not like you just had a massive action scene happen instead it's subtle it's like going from a small room to outside it's that distinct one of the best ways I can describe it is kind of like the difference between listening to a CD and a live performance and I don't mean a pre-recorded live performance I mean you're standing right there in the venue now most of the tracks I was using to test this audio player were actually acoustic jazz which might confuse some of you because of my many mentions of mellow death for life but the fact of the matter is jazz really does it for me the reason I listen to metal especially the more melodic subgenres is mainly due to the complexity of the compositions and that is definitely present in jazz and the fact that I've played countless hours of Fallout has probably helped shape my opinion of the genre I did most of my testing using two different versions of the same songs one of them was at 44.1 kilohertz 16-bit aka CD quality audio and the other was between 96 and 192 kilohertz 24-bit aka Studio audio and on the first version things sounded great I mean CD quality audio is still going to sound really good coming out of this little guy but the moment i nated over to the studio quality track things got interesting when the song moved on to a more complex part I could really pick out subtle nuance sometimes the difference was in the drums where some of the lighter taps weren't really being picked up or at least being muted quite a bit in the CD quality audio where they were front and center in the studio track or sometimes the notes from the piano or the acoustic bass were bringing just a little bit longer and I know it sounds inconsequential but it made such a huge difference when it came to filling out the room so to speak but to be perfectly honest I don't think I can do the experience justice it's one of those things where you have to hear to believe and I feel the HP one actually does a really nice job delivering a beginners audiophile experience on a beginner's budget you don't have to break the bank to experience this even with your headphones because I'll be perfectly honest the headphones that I had the best experience with do not retail for a couple hundred dollars more like under a hundred dollars and of course this experience got my Creator gears turning because there are two very popular genres out there right now that are not taking advantage of lossless audio or at least not by much and those on razorba casts in ASMR videos now I know most of you are probably familiar with podcasts which are basically just spoken word programs and if recorded properly and presented on a device like this it will sound like you're not listening to a recording but instead you're sitting right next to them in the room and for the uninitiated what ASMR is is auditory sensory meridian response think of the pleasurable tingling you get down your spine when you hear certain sounds I didn't even think I was susceptible to that I've watched a few ASMR videos and had zero reaction and yet listening to some of the music on this device those very soft drum taps kind of made the hairs on the back of my arm stand up so imagine if somebody like me was affected by that on a device like this what would happen to an ASMR track saved in flack and then played back on one of these devices who knows it might even sound less like their crinkling that wrapper towards a microphone and more like their crinkling it right next to your ear and during my quest to find things to review for budget tubing I may or may not have gotten my hands on the gear needed to record at 192 24 and I've got a few candy wrappers lying around so if there are enough people who want it down in the comments maybe I'll try a lossless ASMR recording well anyway that's enough rambling about the potential uses for flack before I sign up I do want to say one thing I do agree with the people who say once you had a certain level of audio quality going any higher will give you diminishing returns if anything and most people won't be able to hear the difference at that point but I'll also say based on my experiences with the HP one that there is indeed something to be gained moving upward from CD quality audio truthfully I was hoping to capture some sample audio from this device to show you the differences but it turns out YouTube is most likely going to be crunching the audio in this video so you would not have been able to tell a dang thing oh well you'll just have to check the description down below and decide whether or not you want to take the first step to beginner audio file them and on the topic of audio I've got a ton more mics to review for budget tubing so until next time the is your guy cly signing off

source switch which from what i know is for volume as well as tracking all right so let's open this okay before i want it okay it really looks like an apple watch without the straps um but even though it does look a little bit like it its purpose is entirely different it's not meant to replace your apple watches it's meant to improve your music as well as to use it as a mp3 player which sadly for many smart watches they do not have this feature yet where you can listen to your music without your phone so that's why i got it for the top part right it's a little bit fingerprint magnetic right so you gotta wipe it once in a while or you know you have your screen protected to help you out okay so so this product has a two and a half inch touchscreen yeah it is a by 240. it's pretty neat and it is attack right so that basically what it does what is a deck a lot of people will ask what is attack for this man people wells just basically improves the audio and you can do that for computers you can do that for your phones you can do that for your car stereo or you can just use it for mp3 player yourself so that's on and on there you go just hold it on you get the intro i i pretty like it yeah okay born for music english let's press english okay [Music] and you'll have the main screen so what it does is you have this main screen which you can swipe okay just left and right you have browse file which if you place in the ssd card you're gonna have some files on it you can play your music right um lossless files will be great as well so you know you're gonna have some good quality music right there you have your bluetooth receiver so just to note this is really unique for this product it has it can act as a receiver and a transmitter so what that means is that it can receive your bluetooth connection so that you can use your wireless airpods you can use your wireless headphones no problem so it even makes it even greater for running um transmitter meaning you can connect it to your computer or your phone and then you can plug in a 3.5 mm cable and you can get higher quality music than what you originally had right go for settings recording so what it is able to do is you can record from this device so sd cards are available you have your steps counter step counter it's not that accurate but then again i would not use it to cut my steps yeah so you can start it right here so you can study steps yeah okay so i mean i think it's pretty intuitive um there's like oh that's the end okay so anyway what it's capable of doing is when you have your music playing right you're gonna have this screen which i think it's pretty good um it's very direct left right for next shuffle or not go to your playlist like for your favorites that is it that is all you need right okay and yeah i mean of course it's not gonna get expected so much right there you have it um review on the mu on the music quality i'll give you the pros and cons later but yeah here it is [Music] all right guys so guess what came to the mail all right it's the strat all right so basically what you're going to have here is a sprayer yeah i'm not sure how many mm is this but i don't think that we can it's not interchangeable yeah because of well i'll let you know if it's interchangeable like i don't think so so this is the silicon version okay so it comes up with this two straps screws okay so this is how you're gonna attach it right so you're gonna attach it with screws and this is the casing very nice finish and you have yourself that which i'm not going to use because well i got my trusty one right okay so this is how you do it you got it right here remember they gave along an acrylic one of course this has to go out which of course i'm going to take it up for you and i'm going to attach it for you too so what's interesting this is how it's supposed to go on right here right here and then this yeah and the screws go on right here so what's good right i'm not going to do it now but what's good is for you to place in your screen protector so you just don't get your finger marks on it as you can see it's working just fine yeah and i'm supposed to do this so i'll just leave this on because you know i'm just that kind of guy and try to match it up to this too all right try to match it up just just to note all right putting this on doesn't make this waterproof at all it's just for you to put put it on when you're running and stuff [Music] and you're done that's how it looks like pretty neat i think it's pretty neat but like i mentioned you know house on your wrist looks like that um if you're in singapore it looks like you know the casio where people on probation they get tagged on their on their ankles that's how it's like let me on it for you ah there you go so we have you here rather than that pretty neat right yeah i i think it really works it's functional and well i think for silicon or rubber i think it's rubber yeah anyway it works just right and i think it's gonna be great for you if you're interested in buying one so let's hit on top and i'll give you guys my thoughts all right welcome back and right now let's go down indeed with the pros and cons of the field m5 portable music player which we have right here okay so pros well it's really good if you are running if you are exercising going to work out in the gym you hate to bring around your phone you know i just sometimes you want to go into zen mode right you need to to ensure that you know you're just thinking straight you don't want to have any distractions any messages from your girlfriend number one two and three or boyfriend one two and three it does so much more than that and for the price point which i'll cover later it's really amazing okay so what you have and well you can just connect it via bluetooth man it's amazing that's where apple failed because well apple watch well it's a good alternative to it um of course you can't do everything that um apple watch can do but well it's for those music lovers you just want your watchful music i mean garmin has it too but well this vo m5 is really cheap it's really cheap for the quality and affordable and well what else does it do you can connect it to your computer your your music player you can just use it to improve the quality of your audio right it's a dac as well so girls are all in one there are certain um brands that you have alternatives for each as well around the same price point but for this well it looks sick as tits very so sick and well when i handed it to my mom well all you have to do is just swipe look at that and it's so clean right i mean of course it's uh it attracts a lot of fingerprints but it helps you have step counters recording i mean of course all those we don't really use it's more towards it being affordable mp3 player going back to the basics like maybe like 15 20 years back yeah around 15 years back where we just won an mp3 well i really really love if the the world could invent a watch that helps you use spotify offline with a watch you can just download it which of course you can do it with an apple watch i believe the later series but but this quite doesn't cut it right because well you're just going to stream it off battery life is fine too it actually lasts like i think 20 hours 20 hours like that standby 20 hours yeah use i think somewhere i'll i'll list it down below okay um yeah i don't think there's any cons uh if you buy it for what you want it to do okay maybe okay recording wise all right if you want to use it as a recorder it's not that great if you want to use it as a step counter it's not that great either okay even with the watch strap i can swipe it to the left so price point let's go for the price point [Music] price point it's going to be 150 dollars there about singapore dollars um for u.s is going to be a hundred dollars usd and for the watch track it's 24 singapore dollars and around 10 to 15 dollars depending on whether it's the leather strap or the silicone strap that you buy from in us so there you have it the links are going to be down below if you want to purchase it okay so like i said the theo m5 portable high resolution mp3 player not only mp3 you can use a lot of variations on it and still play yeah no issues at all and be sure that you get it from the right distributor because i don't know if there are any um well fake versions of it i'm sure there is because and yeah this is it the feel m5 portable high resolution music player oh that's a mouthful okay so don't

players|Sennheiser HD650|Sony Wh1000XM3 Headphones,2020-10-07 10:14:21.032163," [Music] hi everyone welcome back to spare cash tech review Lakes you come to they get acknowledged on where to spend your money on the latest tech okay today we're gonna talk about high resolution audio players a higher resolution digital audio players before I dig into dig too deep into this I just want to say this for the record this is for people that don't know anything about high-resolution players this is not for people that I already have a background in and they already understand an a narrow own one this is for people that have no idea what a high-resolution player is and they want to find out so that's what this is what this particularly episode is concerning so this is what I consider high resolution audio players one on one okay so why are our resolution players why are they even being spoken about well I'll give you a little bit of history of mp3 files even though you can get a lot of files on your iPods you get on your cell phones and iPads whatever you play your music back on you can get on the music's highly compressed so you can pack a lot of them in a little space or storage medium but the problem you run into is that you're losing the quality of that audio that mp3 you're not hearing what the artists I recorded and music intended for you to hear you're losing certain symbols and I mean to certain instruments you just don't hear because it's basically been compressed out of it so this is where digital higher resolution digital audio players come into play you have I have two versions here I have the high br6 Pro and then I also have here to Sony NW 845 and the reason why he says it was high resolution players is such a big deal because they play audio back at resolutions or sampling rates that Elmo pretty much capture what you heard in a studio like your prettier CD requires normally play back at 44 kilohertz which is fairly good because that particular sampler recovers you mean here on human hearing range from 20 Hertz to 20 kilohertz but when you start having audio playback at 48 kilohertz 98 kilohertz was that 19 96 kilohertz and 192 kilohertz you getting at basically a 24 bit because CD is normally 16-bit at 44 kilohertz and now you're talking about audio files is playing back at much higher sampling rates so you get a more accurate sound in these files and you always recognize a high resolution file you don't either say flack or it can be a WAV file or it could be a DSD there's different file types out there that are they line up with high resolution audio so if you see then most common one is a flex FLAC that's a common file for high resolution players also you know we'll talk about this high rec this particular player here it is high br6 Pro if you have a title subscription this is where this is really beneficial you can stream high res audio from title and this particular unit will allow you to do that so if you have a title subscription you just basically download the app on this particular unit here and you can play it and you so basically you don't have to constantly buy the high resolution audio you can actually file so you can actually just stream them and you can actually save them on this unit this is a 32 gig byte version and this person has Android on at the latest version of Android staff Google Play Store on it so you can download any Android app you want to understand even though this is primarily a music player and just got some really good features on it and I'll touch on some of them when I do the comparison between this unit and the sony this is a very heavy unit it's made out of stainless steel and they also make an aluminum version and it's just probably one of the best ones on the market right now you're looking at about maybe $7.99 between $5.99 is $7.99 is kind of what I'm seeing Sony does make a high-end version it's like $2,000 but it doesn't even have Wi-Fi built in it some of them I don't know I'm not really sure what that's about and maybe I'll have to review that later on well as of right now this is high br6 Pro is one of the best units high resolution players on the market and he can play all of the the flak and wav files and all the high resolution files that's out there that basically title has and there's a few other websites that also playback high resolution audio but I mentioned timer because that's the most common when it most we heard heard of title this unit here Sony it can playback high-resolution audio you know at forty four kilohertz and forty-eight and ninety-six and 192 kilohertz you can play all of those sentries it's just as limited on features does have an SD card slot on it but it's just it's just a player doesn't have built-in wild Wi-Fi doesn't have Android it's got a proprietary software from Sony so you know it sounds good I'm not gonna lie I don't think it's a bad sound and player but it really depends on the type of headphone that you use a nice reason why I have these two headphones here to give you some idea the things you need to consider if you decide to go with high resolution players now this is really not a headphone review but I have both these headphones here for a reason these are very high-end headphones are these are what it cost Sennheiser HD 650 s these headphones very many audio files will they speak very highly these very very high quality very very good sounding headphones but they require a amp that can actually really push them this lower-end sony cannot push or has enough power for h4e sony i mean finish the sennheiser HD 650 now I do have some Sony headphones here these are the newest noise cancellation I think it's WH 100 or 1000 mx3 I believe these are noise cancellation headphones now these sound really well with these particular players here because they don't have as much output they loop into the amp is not high but let me tell you the thing you consider the one of the main reason why these headphones are priced differently and why they make sound different because these actually have way car higher impedance these headphones here have about 30 or 330 hundred in 300 impedance so they're harder to push but and that's the reason why you just if you have high-end headphones already that you need to buy a player such as the high br6 Pro which has a a very has a powerful amp unfortunately the this particular this particular Sony here does not have the power to drive you were to buy these headphones the Sun Hat sennheiser 650 s HD 650 s they use it with this particular amp you're not gonna get the full benefit from these headphones because they require so much power and these just don't have it these on the other hand this particularly one the high br6 pro definitely has the power now another thing to consider too if you decide to go into high risk digital audio players there's a there's a turn output called a balanced output and a balanced output actually even though there's there's two headphone ports on here one your standard headphone port that you can plug your regular headphones into that you chronic and probably have laying around a house and then you have what they call a balanced output and this output and only requires a different type of tip and you might have - this right here is a four point four millimeter tip so this won't fit into your normal headphone route but it'll fit it to the balance if you go you go with the balanced output on these particular units here it's even the output is even higher so this unit is more than capable of driving these headphones unfortunately there's so many nwa 45 does not have the power to push these headphone now these are lower impedance so when you're thinking about headphones normally the higher quality headphones have a higher impedance so these probably had like maybe 50 I don't know 50 I'm not really sure the impedances but it's assistant maybe around 50 60 75 70 or something like that but these are easier to push so a particular player like this IRA's player would a low power amp could easily drive these but you know if you're going with these high-end ones specifically the sennheiser HD 56 50s either you're gonna have to use these there a higher amp or you have to get an external app now there's something that I have here that if you are set on if you've already downloaded title on your cell phone and you don't want to go by another player but you want to get the benefits of title and you want and you want to have a really good amp because your cell phone's not gonna have the amp you can buy way to call it a headphone amp this is by a company called file and this particular headphone amp actually plugs into the there's a connector on the bottom of this unit that plugs and there's another cable to connects to the bottom of your cell phone and you can this actually boosts the the output of your cell phone and this obviously has it also has a balanced output on it too so it really can push these headphones here a lot harder you have a better chance of hearing how these headphones were intended to be hurt if you have a headphone amp that you can use with your cell phone if you just want to you don't want to buy have a headphone carry around of headphones or carry your own cell phone and amp you know just get that I br6 Pro this is there's a lot of features this thing have and I probably could just do a review on this by itself but I kind of wanted to give people that are considering to go into high res audio some things to consider so a real quick recap the high br6 pro has built-in Wi-Fi you can stream title has a powerful amp can drive higher in headphones the sony in w45 I mean 45s actually Sony nw8 45 amp is not as powerful most likely to be better for maybe headphones that's maybe not headphones that's not as expensive it can play back all the type of high res files like flak and wave and and several other DSD all your different type of high resolution audio formats so you can play files up to 192 kilohertz all the way down to 44 and you can also play mp3 also but you don't buy these players to play mp3 files so anyway that's some kind of everything in the new show you know DeLorean Sounion 45 still good player if you've got a if you just wanted if you really bent on just sticking with your cell phone but you want to get the benefits of title or other streaming services that extreme high resolution audio then get you a high phone a headphone amp million a lot of different models out there just go online and just review you know look at different reviews and or even just go to the what I would like to do is I like to look at the the ratings you know I go to Amazon I look at the ratings and it gives me a good idea you know sometimes people may have bad experience with stuff so sometime you want to know about that so anyway thank you very much for logging in or watching my youtube

alternative,2020-10-07 10:14:21.032221," hey everyone today we're gonna take a look at this this is the pioneer XD p02 you high-res digital music player now for those of you that are following my channel you probably are thinking why did I get a digital music player isn't that why you got the lttb 35 for is to use it as a digital audio music player high res music player and yes this is the LGB 35 can't double as a digital music player or digital audio player high res music player first things first let's take a little step back or a little background you have two types of dedicated music players you have an mp3 player right and that's all it is and then you have your high res digital audio music player which is also an mp3 player but it plays more than just empty mp3 files it plays high res music files so what is high res so without getting too technical high res is music files or music quality that is better than CD quality so basically have different types of music files or for those of us that are watching this you mostly use like mp3 files mp3 files are okay and you know they're not bad for listening to music but and I still have mp3 files myself so an mp3 file is a compressed audio file and what that means is it's a smaller file so you can fit it into you know like a small mp3 player music player but because they have to make the file size smaller you're missing out on a lot of detail that a normal music file likes a flat or L DAC that Sony invented it would have more detail or resolution the way your artists or your singers intended for the music to come out and be heard so high res music files because not compressed you're gonna pick up more detail in the music think of like you know when your eyes start getting bad and they're blurry and you need more and you need glasses that's kind of like that's kind of like how it is with mp3 files in larger high-res files I mean with mp3 files you can still see probably not as good but then when you you know get your eyes corrected and you start wearing glasses or contact lens and you see better you know you can see farther you can see better that's the same thing with a high-res music player versus just using like your smartphone and listening to your regular mp3 files so I hope that explains that so if you're a brand new audio enthusiast and you go online like say for me Amazon there are so many so many mp3s or high-res digital music players to choose from I mean it could be overwhelming and they can go anywhere from like a little over $50 to as much as $4,000 or almost $4,000 right and there's so many brands for me though only brands I do know at the time that make audio players or mp3 players is like Sony with their Walkman line and file but there are so many more like you have your Astle and currents that make real expensive high-end high res digital music players and then you also have this company right here you have pioneer and your more expensive high res digital music players you can also use them as a deck for your computer or your laptop or your tablet and some have amplifiers like this one so you can use them as an audio deck and amplifier so I got this one this is the Pioneer like I said and the reason why I got this one is because number one this is my first high-res digital music audio so I didn't want to get something that's gonna like put me in a hole or break the bank so to speak as we all know because of this coke coronavirus thing some of us still are not working full-time yet and then the other thing why I got this one was because for its price so you can get this on Amazon for around 200 in $24 it comes in three colors white blue and pink I got the white version I wanted the blue version but they didn't have it at the time and this was on sale that's another reason why I got it it was on a prime day sale I think Amazon Prime day sale one of those limited sales and they also allowed you to pay in installments with no financing so sometimes they do that sometimes they don't but even if they didn't this was this was one of the ones that I settled on because for its price it had the most features so pioneer also has another version I don't know if they and that one is like they're more higher-end version is the XDP 300 R and that one goes for around $800 that's that smartphone territory folks so I was like let me just pick this up because it has almost the same amount of features as their more high-end $800 music player the XDP 300 at a fraction of the cost is it has this has twin twin decks this the SS saber saber ESS 90 18 decks and it has twin amplifiers as the more high-end this is the only player that I saw on Amazon for the price for its price under $300 that had those features the the next player that I know of that had twin decks and twin amps they're going for over 300 over $400 so that's another reason why I got this for all of you new audio enthusiasts pioneer as the company they started off way back in Tokyo in around 1938-39 like a home stereo equipment company probably like your radio shacks and then a group larger from that pioneer was the first company to make plasma televisions back in the days and when I was growing up in high school Pioneer was big it was a big name in car audio and home audio and they still are kind of a big deal in home audio and they have the elite series and things like that so that is pioneer and that's another reason why I got it because I know the brand I know the company they've been around the audio industry for a long time so let's just open up the box enough for the history lesson and see what we have so now that we got the plastic we moved so here up top where the front is your pioneer name on the bottom digital music player on the top left top right you have the model number and a small picture of the player and also the color as you can see right there and then going on to the right side see is where it shows you some of the features the twin deck it's got 16 gigs of built-in storage it has two microSD card slots that's another thing it's the only one of the only few in its price range that has two microSD card slots so the potential for upgrades is there and right here on the bottom you see that high res audio certification here in the back is all your specs so you can pause that and read it for yourself this is one of the few players that also has bluetooth and Wi-Fi one of the few that has all the like I said has so many features it has one of the most the most amount of features in its price range and that's why I got it on the side nothing bottom just nothing just Bluetooth logos trademarks and stuff like that so you can pause that and read it for yourself up top is your model and serial number so that is it for that and let's open this up okay so the first thing we have to do is cut this tape once we cut the tape you guess you lift it up like so flap and there is the music player itself so the last dedicated music player that I had was I believe a creative Zen mp3 player really small player probably much smaller than this this kind of reminds me of mice and disk music player that I had or mp3 player it's about the same size okay before we take a look at this um I guess let's see what else we get in the box so underneath the tray were the music player is at we have your charging cable which is a USB a two micro USB as you can see too bad it's not USB see I'm thinking because this was released in like 2018 we're late 2017 so I'm gonna do my pass on that it's not one of the newest players out there from Pioneer or from any company for that matter it looks like you we get a plastic screen protector and then you get your Quick Start Guide right here you get a product brochure for for on kill music studio quality recording so it's like a brochure or something maybe a download for Onkyo use it so back in 2014 I think Onkyo bought pioneer electronics home entertainment division pioneer makes all kinds of stuff DJ equipment like I said car stereo equipment vote stereo equipment so see high-res downloads available this for something for free yes none they just advertised Onkyo music so that's that and uh Akio I believe also makes a version of their music players of the xdp 300 and that's the x1a and that one is also $800 so there is no way I was gonna be able to afford that or get that so yeah this part this one is a Quick Start Guide Quick Start manual and then this looks like a warranty card and then your more in-depth manual I guess so you got your manual your warranty card Quick Start Guide and their little brochure for Akio music but it's nothing they're not giving it for free though or are they so here is the high res music player itself it feels pretty weighty for for its size and it's it was packed in this really in this trade it was really tight inside that tree and so here is the player so this is plastic I was hoping it would be like aluminum or metal like some of the more higher or even I'm not gonna say higher end offerings but compared to its competition those who build those are built out of metal and this is mostly plastic it's only at that two hundred dollar range because if it was metal it would have probably been more expensive but like I said for for its price range it has features well above it way more features even more than some of the other players that um that are like almost a thousand dollars like I said this has a 20 X C twin amps it has 16 gigs of built-in storage two memory card slots microSD card slots he has a touch panel so let's walk through so here is the screen itself and it's a 2.4 inch I believe 320 by 320 so it's a 2.4 inch screen so it's not a big screen like some of the other ones in its competition or even it's this its older brother or sister which has a for 4.4 inch screen I think or 4.2 inch screen so that's it that's the front it's a this part right here is the screen here on the bottom here on the bottom we have your our micro USB port you can see the screws right there feel solid though for plastic and right here on the left side is your play button to your skip or backward back button play pause button forward button and see here's here your two memory card slots right there for Michael SD cards here in the back is probably nothing much just as pioneer and then you know your you will electronic safety information or whatever I don't know if I can peel this off yeah you can't I probably won't and then here on the right finally is your volume up and down toggle button and here on the bottom that says twin deck then here up top is our power button what is this a microphone it's a little microphone hole I don't is it a microphone it's a little hole for something I don't know what that is then here is your standard headphone jack 3.5 headphone jack and then you have a smaller 2.5 I believe for your balance connect if you have one of those headphones they have the balanced connector so that is it for the walkthrough right there I'm going to remove this tape and yes I will put in the other screen protector because I believe this is not the real class so it's probably just plastic so I'm gonna need to put on that screen protector but for now let's power it on let's see if there's any juice and then that's a wrap for this unboxing is there any juice it's not going on so that's pretty much gonna wrap up the this unboxing I guess because there's no power on this player so what I want to do with this player for the upcoming review is to test out number one how easy it is to use I want to be able to see if I can use this without looking at the instructions how easy it is to use I mean what's the most easiest player to use I mean for most of you is probably gonna be like a iPod if you still have those or something similar and I want to test this out as a as a deck for my laptop how that works if it's easy to set up as a DAC for your laptop or your computer and then finally you know how good it sounds compared to like my lg v35 also compared to my arm my DAC headphone adapter right here so I'm gonna compare how it sounds compared to this compared to the note 10 plus with this deck yeah 32-bit deck headphone adapter and see how they sound so so that about wraps it up for this unboxing so what do you get you get the high-res music player itself you get a screen protector plastic screen protector you get your QuickStart guide instruction manuals in your warranty card and a brochure for Onkyo music and that's about it so if you guys are interested in this music player ahead of my review I will put a link for pioneers product page on pioneer comm and also on Amazon's product page for this music player so if you guys want to learn more about its features ahead of my review and I'll put those links in the description but that is it for the unboxing I'm not saying I recommend this yet I'm probably yeah I'm not gonna recommend this yet until I do my thorough review so stay tuned for that but that is about it for now hope you guys enjoyed the brief overview and of mp3's and pioneer so if you guys learned anything

302,iiAj_COvPJ4,Sony Europe,UCsmJ-6uyV8HDxO0BmPWk-kQ,What is High Resolution Audio?,"Learn more about High Resolution Audio: http://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/hd-audio/t/hdd-audio-players

We hear the phrase High Resolution Audio a lot nowadays, but how many of us know exactly what it means? Eric Kingdon explains everything you need to know, and goes into more detail on our High Resolution Audio HDD players.",28,648,2.0,8.0,0.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iiAj_COvPJ4/hqdefault.jpg,high resolution|hi res audio|Sony hi res|Sony high resolution|sony audio,2020-10-07 10:14:21.032244, so I guess high-resolution is a term that's talked a lot about and it's all over the web it's in magazines it's a Tifa in a big way and I think it's quite clear that it's about better quality and what do we exactly mean by better quality and we can assign lots of ways of measuring quality like frequency response harmonic distortion dynamic range and so on and so on and digitally speaking high resolution is about basically going beyond the specification of compact discs and CD has been one of the most successful format carriers ever I think though it has been around with us for a long time now and the interesting thing is for a long time we've been recording in the studio a higher specification levels for example 24-bit and above now we're also using faster and higher sampling rates so if you follow that through it makes logical sense if we can take that higher quality and put it into a format that we can enjoy now that can be in a packaged media form or it could be and it's becoming extremely popular in a downloadable form so you can easily access that content and put it on various devices and there are a number of telecommunication companies that are coming up with chipsets that can handle high-resolution codecs in other words higher bitrate fastest sampling frequency and much more data because memory in itself is becoming a commodity that's quite affordable now you can say what why did we do it in the studio when originally we've been living with CD which is only 16-bit sampled at forty four point one killers and part of that is because of the noise so when you make a studio recording you want to do various things you want to mix in you maybe want to edit and so on and that process in itself can introduce various artifacts for example noise so if you started a higher bit level with a a much higher quality then any degradation that occurs is is minimized but of course with CD we have to go then down and back to 16-bit and we as a company developed something called super bit mapping which allowed us to take the noise that's generated we call this a kind of quantization noise and push it where you can't hear it this is called noise shaping now that worked very well but now we're in the situation where we're really saying we don't need to do that anymore we can take it natively as is and allow you to enjoy it at a level of performance that will literally take you almost to the live event or the recording when it was done and there are different grades of levels above CD where we enter the high resolution realm I mean for instance you can have a higher sampling rate at 16-bit so you could have 16-bit 48 kilohertz you could have 24-bit at 96 kilohertz and then moving towards the kind of typically upper level operation on if you want to call it that of PCM linear PCM you have 24 bit 192 kilohertz but there are even higher levels now that's one approach and there is another because more bits don't always equate to shall we say the ultimate but kind of sound and that's something called direct stream digital now DSD turns things slightly on the head but gives you an outstanding experience by utilizing essentially one bit so Utah is a very very high speed data stream running it at least two point eight megahertz of high-speed single bit data which represents if you like the density or the structure of the musical waveform by utilizing a single bit stream now you can actually even now go above that and we already work with a double DSD rate which runs at around 5.6 makers now because it's digital you can access those files also from high resolution music download sites and they are amazing when you listen to a DSD file downloaded it really really is something special and the show at4 what we're trying to do is to allow you to listen to our resolution music in high bitrate linear PCM formats and also DSD of course as well and of course the equipment we're using in itself has happened to take a level up so for instance the hard disc player system we've developed and the one that we're demonstrating utilizers what I would term an ideal D to a converter system for DSD itself and because it's built around if you like the finest quality replay we've even engineered what we call a remastering system such that a lower bitrate that comes into the product can actually be then for want of a better description can be up sampled and turned into a DSD stream so then you have the optimum playback for whatever basically you throat care to playback on the unit itself so I think high resolution is something that's going to touch our lives in many ways I mean whether it be on a mobile product whether it be on a computer system we're already you know these files if they're stored on your computer you can connect a high-resolution USB d/a-converters simply to it and we have a product where you can simply listen via headphones and headphones themselves making great leaps and bounds in terms of extending their frequency range law reduce their distortion and so on to make the most of this this technology concept and I really think that the proof of the pudding is in the eating well in this case it's listening and I think listen and you'll see

309,lubo0ZQKeag,AV Atmos,UCIt01rROdBNVDfVr8owm8sQ,Astell & Kern Kann Alpha Debuts as a hi-res audio player for Audiophiles,"Astell & Kern has introduced the Kann Alpha, adding greater portability, power and battery life to its Kann line of hi-res audio players.

Available from October, priced at £1099, the Alpha is also the first Astell & Kern player to implement Bluetooth 5.0, providing greater range and more stable connection and superior audio quality.

Following on from the four-star Kann Cube, the Alpha features a more powerful built-in headphone amplifier that promises to drive any pair of headphones. The  rearranging of various components and use of smaller resistors and capacitors, meanwhile, means you get that added power in a smaller and more portable chassis.

That sleeker design is coupled with an increased battery life, up more than 50 per cent to an impressive 14.5 hours.

That means you can enjoy your hi-res library for longer without charging, and the Alpha is capable of playing files up to 32-bit/384kHz PCM and DSD256, while also supporting MQA playback via both downloaded files and the Tidal music app.

Complete with a 4.1-inch touchscreen display, which offers album artwork alongside file type and volume information, the Alpha comes with 64GB on-board memory that can be expanded up to 1TB via its microSD card slot.

With its interface running on a customised version of Android 9.0, there is support for major services including Tidal, Spotify, Amazon Music, Apple Music, Deezer, Qobuz, Bandcamp, Audible and TuneIn.

realism that makes it much more enjoyable to listen to the producers and artists have long been aware of this so they capture their recordings at the highest quality possible in most cases a quality that makes even CD sound flat and lifeless and comparison though recently these master recordings were simply not available for the average listener to enjoy music lovers ourselves sony created high-resolution audio products to give you that next best thing needs to being right there in the studio or live venue with your favorite musicians if you're a music lover the simple fact is your low five resolution audio video I want to drill into some of the fundamentals of sound to help you better understand why high resolution is such an important innovation and how we got to this point in the history of audio recording and it's a fascinating subject music local audio is vibrations in the air an instrument or speaker creates high or low speed vibrations which our ears capture and translate into a huge range of pictures in tones as its most simple a fast vibration or high frequency creates a high pitch while a lower frequency one will produce a lower pitch other characteristics such as the shape and energy of these sound wave vibrations then determine the type and volume of the sound so capturing and storing this audio for later playback has come in a variety of forms over the years but it can broadly be broken up into three types analog digital and digitally compressed despite being is convenient in digital formats a good analog audio recording is valued even today for its natural realistic sound analog recordings whether on magnetic tape record or even wax cylinders capture and reproduce the sound vibrations directly the needle on a record player is literally bumping along microscopic groups and those tiny vibrations are simply amplified into the electrical signals that drive your speakers it's a good system with few steps between the audio being captured and being reproduced but it requires physical and sometimes fragile objects for storage not ideal for the large music collections we all have now a digital recording starts the same way as an analogue one was capturing those vibrations but these sound waves are then converted to a series of coordinates when a digital audio file is playback those coordinates are used to reconstruct the sound wave back to an analog signal which your speakers or headphones can recognize and reproduce all things being equal the quality of a digital audio recording is determined by two things the sampling frequency which is how many of these coordinates are captured per second and the bitrate which is how accurate each of these coordinates is relative to the original audio signal when the CD was developed by Sony and Philips a lot of thought went into what specifications would allow it to deliver a good listening experience while being reasonably practical to use the result was a sampling frequency of forty four point one kilohertz or just over 44,000 samples per second each captured at a bit rate of 16 bits which determines how precise the height or energy of that coordinate is together these two things determine the frequency range or the range of pitches from low to high and the dynamic range the volume from soft to add a recording can contain that 44.1 kilohertz sample rate gives us a range of reproducible frequencies of around 22 to 20,000 Hertz roughly the capability of human hearing and the 16-bit bitrate results in a dynamic range of 96 decibels easily enough to reproduce a live orchestra from solo piccolo to full noise so the CD remains a good format but its physical dimensions and the inability to stream or download means it has been rapidly replaced by new compressed file formats with much smaller file sizes and no physical size compressed audio formats like mp3 or AAC are the way most people enjoy music now whether via streaming services or from files stored on your device a compressed audio file offers unmatched convenience a good way to think about compressed music files is by considering a drawing on a piece of paper if you fold up the paper you can fit it in your pocket but once you've done that it's impossible to fully restore it to its original state as small the file is is determined by the data rate it's common for streaming services to offer audio at around 120 to 300 kilobits per second and most tracks you pictures and download are around 250 kilobits per second that's about 1/5 the file size of a digital track on a CD of course not all digital file formats are the same either so a modern AAC file sounds better than an older mp3 file even if it's the same as biocides think of it as more careful folding we now understand that most digital music starts out sounding pretty good at CD quality or better but it is then compressed so that you can stream it on your smart phone or download it quickly to your computer the real question then is what you're missing out on and should you care so here's uncompressed me and a typical compressed stream in their short samples probably playing through your basic speakers or headphones you might not hear much difference but this is what you're missing out on while compressing audio doesn't change the basic sound of a music track much it does change how you feel about it the more detail is contained in a minute track the more real it sounds and the greater your emotional response to it we've all been moved by music at some point it's a powerful tool used by filmmakers retailers even call center so delivering all that detail to your ears quite literally changes how much you enjoy it and that brings us back to high resolution audio high resolution audio goes beyond even CD quality offering higher sampling frequencies of ends in tracks it's like using that really nice glossy photo paper steel picture instead of regular printer paper the use of higher put rates like 24 bits rather than CDs 16 bits means that you have more dynamic range so you can accurately capture the tiniest subtlety like the tap of a pianist fingernails across the keyboard or the subtle break in a singer's voice as well as all the impact of the drums holder and all without compromise the highest sampling frequency of ABS 192 colors five times their of CD quality means a much wider frequency range is captured and reproduced we met with an appropriate amplifier and speakers or headphones audio frequencies greater than 20 kilohertz are reproduced including ultra-high frequency harmonics the subtle components of the sound which told to give especially acoustic instruments their character we all know the experience of sitting in the audience for a live performance and we know the experience is not the same as listening to a CD recording of it later high-resolution audio isn't just about hearing at it's about experiencing a difference the music may be the same but the feeling and presence that the music conveys is what changes our we're lucky that recording engineers have known all this the years so they've already captured audio and their studios at the highest resolution available to them what sony is offering with high resolution audio products is to reproduce that audio in your home or headphones exactly and your favorite artist and record producer intended you to and amezo Glover couldn't ask for more than that [Music]"

The player packs a massive 128GB – or not so massive considering a single FLAC album is in the hundreds of megabytes, a full gigabyte even. There’s a microSD card slot if you run out, but at an ultrabook price we were hoping for a bit more room out of the box. 
Anyway, the Sony Walkman – officially NW-ZX2 – runs Android on a 4″ screen. The screen is not up to up to par with the audio capabilities. Not that the screen is a crucial part of a music player, but something better than 480 x 854px would have been appreciated.
Android 4.2 Jelly Bean is also not our top pick. With the whole “will they, won’t they” upgrade situation on phones, I don’t even want to think what it’s like to wait for a music player to be updated.
Did I mention that for $1,200 you don’t get an impressive pair of headphones? Or any headphones? Headphones are essential, otherwise the difference between FLAC and MP3 is imaginary. Just saying that you have to add several hundred dollars more if you want this Walkman player.
At least it gets decent battery life – 60 hours. If you listen to 128Kbps MP3s. If you want to use the player as intended and listen to FLAC, you get about half the battery life, 33 hours. 
If you want a smaller device at a quarter of the price than this seems like an option – $300 for 64GB and an empty microSD card slot. Or if you insist on Android, you can get the Harman/Kardon HTC One (M8) that also supports 96kHz/24-bit FLAC audio.

have you been thinking about or looking at the eye happier high-res mp3 audio player will stick around we've got the unboxing for you right after this amazing intro [Music] welcome back to my channel easy choice food reviews where I do the reviews to help give you an easy choice today we're gonna be doing an mp3 high res audio player it's not something that I use very often but in certain situations I don't want to take my phone I do still have an mp3 player my kids use mp3 players so they they actually are quite prevalent still in today's technology so I'm kind of excited to use this since I haven't used an mp3 player in a while I will let you know that they did provide this product they are not paying me to do the review on it but they did provide the product so I do think I happier to a happier for sending me this product so go ahead and drive this is supposed to be a pretty powerful mp3 player it's got up to 24-bit decoder rate which is higher than higher res standards it's got a dual-core processor and the signal to noise ratio the SNR is up to 115 DB which is said to provide very clear audio it does support a handful of audio file formats WAV WMA mp3 and quite a bit more that has an IPS screen which is said to have less loss if you look at it from a different angle it shouldn't have all that color loss that you find on normal LCD screens it's also supposed to have a great response time to provide an snappier and smoother processing of your audio files it will take about an hour and a half to fully charge this thing but it's said to have a 20 hour battery life off a little full charge so let's go ahead and do the unboxing all right here we go this so it comes in the packaging it does have a hard plastic wrapping on here I'll go ahead and get that off and there we have it actually is a little bit smaller than I expected I did not expect it to be as small as it is that must be the selection wheel or and it's got a click feature to it so that's pretty nice that must be back forward reverse looks like we've got USB see here a micro SD slot comes with an 8 gig micro SD card we'll go ahead and put that back in there okay your audio plug here your power reset feels pretty solid a little heavier than I thought it would be but still pretty solid there's a USBC to USBA adapter i've got an 18 month warranty on this and an instruction manual so we'll go ahead and get started on this plug it into a computer drop some files on it and see how it sounds maybe charge it up for a minute and we'll be right back okay so we've connected the I happier mp3 player and it does have a couple of sample songs on here don't know if I like those we want to keep those but we'll just leave them in there for now this one one of them a motorcycle I like to listen to these ones so we'll just since I already have this playlist I'll go ahead and throw it on there and we'll see see what it sounds like [Music] you [Music] you [Music] okay now that we've downloaded some music on here let's go ahead and see what they sound like I mean so we did the unboxing and I actually kind of like it I've downloaded some music flipped through some of it and kind of just a simple listen and the sound is pretty good I definitely think it's one of the better mp3 players of I've ever used but I will have to test it out so right now I've got a generic prayer headphones and I highly think the sound quality is going to depend on which set of headphones you're using that being said my initial assessment as I wish that they had this mp3 player in a Bluetooth version so that you don't have to be connected to a court they may have one I'll have to look and see but as of now sounds pretty good I'm not sure if it's worth the money but I'll go ahead and test it out for a few weeks and I'll see what I think one other thing I will say is that the menu is pretty smooth that it's pretty easy to navigate pretty simplistic and the screen is very nice it is easy to see different angles and stuff like that so I want to thank you guys for watching this video if you like my videos go ahead and click Subscribe and click the bell for notifications so you can get

10:14:21.439968, hello youtube and welcome back to another video and this video is a follow-up to a video posted five months ago back in april uh 2020 right at the start of the uk coronavirus lockdown and there the video was an unboxing of this astell and kern um super junior uh super junior is it super junior aka junior it's a basically a version of the 8k junior high-res audio player this is the bottom lowest spec um audio player still fairly expensive you're looking around 200 pounds now uh new you probably pick it up for about 150 even less um secondhand so like i say i've had this for now for five months it's not got as much use as it as my previous audio players because of lockdown but that's been used for about an hour every day just usually accompanying me on a run um so it's given me a lot of chance to actually use it uh as it would be used obviously not a lot normally i would be using it a lot longer on commutes and uh for traveling but we've not had any of this so let's kick in and the first thing that lots of people have said well no i've not actually noticed it on any of the reviews but the buttons aren't particularly responsive i think um see it takes a while from pressing the button to actually starting up so once it you know the screen kicks in then i'll start the stopwatch okay so actually i'm pressing it there bang there so that's quite it's about you have to hold it for about three seconds before it actually uh kicks in so if you can see it there it normally seems so it's waiting waiting on retrieving file list retrieving the list okay bang and that was the last zone that was played so pause it there so 26 seconds which let's say 25 seconds for my uh slowness at um pressing the button um it's okay it's not it's not fast at all not compared to a it's a bit comparable to rebooting your mobile phone um now i'm going to be using like a pair of old headphones these are really cheap old headphones i used to use many years ago for dj and all the foams going grotty and everything um so normally what i normally use again only a cheap i heard about 40 pounds from um oh and i said carphone warehouse what's it called the really nice wi-fi show um hi-fi shop i can't remember now off the top of my head uh richard sounds that's it um they're okay you know the 40 pounds they're not ex super expensive they're an okay set of headphones that's what i've been using for them but i'll just use this um uh now for the purposes of demonstration because one of the ear phones has actually gone on it now so you see the screen's timed out there so just to get the screen back on you just need to tap the power button and it comes on it's not focusing but there you go so i'll plug that in now normally especially when i'm running i always have my player on shuffle so you can see the shuffle icon in the top there okay so click to play i don't know see what the volume is now this is one thing i really do like about the player is the volume you've got the dial at the side but then you can also squeeze it right down or bring it right up all right so and click play so you can probably hear it you don't want to let's get it if we increase the volume so you could read now that's the one key aspect that i really do love even with using just the cheaper of headphones like those uh sound magic ones the sound quality is excellent normally when i'm traveling i would use my boseh volts poster noise cancelling headphones and then which is again not super expensive but about 200 pounds but the sound quality i would i've listened to it a couple of times for them but obviously not out and about and it is excellent um and like i say now we're playing that through a broken pair of headphones and i can hear it here now really clearly and good now let's say we want to skip now this is one of the things that really bugs me about this player is it's the shuffle is not very random at all it will go to specific songs it probably won't do it now because i'm filming the review but for example there's certain songs that you will go to you know and you you close it down on one song and then it opens up on the same song fair enough you carry on listening the shuffle stone you expect it to go to whichever song comes next um and you know a totally random song but it will go to one that you've heard very recently and it does this very very often um let's see right so i'm gonna go just skip there so there's your forward and back buttons and there's certain songs like one that always turns up is a number 11 by the blue tones um it doesn't matter what they are now another one is uh subterranean homesick blues by bob dylan there's a classical piece of liturgy um money changes everything by the smiths but then similar songs like that will always just turn up on the the shuffle right so we go let's see which comes up number 11 by the blue tones which blue tonic where it says that is the uh published title of it and that now if i skip it again it probably goes to i think a barbershop song or maybe the subterranean homesick blues song i don't know i don't know the beatles okay running's out okay um and that's another thing so let's say let's turn the volume up so you can maybe hear it as it's going okay so we'll skip that okay oh don't want to listen bondy see how long it takes between the person to skip and then the actual um uh song loading which is i think it's really very very slow compared to what i'm used to on using an old ipod especially the old ipod i was using um it was a hard drive now this is all solid state so all the data on here is um it's in the memory card so it should be instantly um obviously it's doing something else now um it should be instant instant instant but it's not uh so it's clicked onto genres so the in the screen that's another negative point the screen is very very unresponsive so let's see well we want to look at songs so we it's playing their song for myself sugar spoon sister by the stone roses so click on that now look at the time it takes just to access the list of songs it's waiting waiting waiting oh here we go so and then there's your list now here we go so we want to scroll through the list now some reviews of i've mentioned this thankfully and it is fairly poor the screen um um screen responsiveness okay it's just slow and then sometimes you go oh one car i'll you know there's probably has it done it there no sometimes it'll use you scrolling and oh it actually plays the song rather than scrolling it okay um you click on that so you gives you the album art and the resolution's pretty poor but again it's not what it is it's the key is in the actual audio um it's interesting there because this is from a live cd the actual sound you can't really hear it there you go i don't know what the quality of that is it's probably a one is it a 128k yeah it's a 128k so it is a plus point when you listen to a high-res file like a flak or they do sound really good especially on the good headphones playlists i've not bothered um putting any playlists up on it um but you yeah here we go albums again so again it takes ages to look at the albums okay and these are obviously because there's a bad tag says i've gotten lots of the files yeah okay there's a little thing there so you can see the little sidebar you can try and hold that and drag it it's a lot easier to do now because i don't have the cover on it um when the covers on it it's a little bit because it goes right to the edge and you can't really touch where the edges on it okay uh and what else is there to say about the other screen protectors which uh astel and kern provide not very good uh if we cut the screen out there again you see some bubbling on it there yeah not particularly brilliant especially with them oh guys nice of them to put it in it so you you get better ones from um the cheapo sellers on ebay uh you know from china they're pretty good uh nowadays compared to some of these um folders let you look at what you've got on your sd card again see there's some responsiveness so let's go for another shuffle okay see and again that celebrates some of that t-rex songs often turns up sex machine right and then to find out your info on the song you've got to click on the song crawling chaos uh it will put subtitles on or subtitles lyrics if they are the lyrics attached to the the file that'll give you your information about the file so what file type it is the bitrate what size is this pretty good there is a um turn the eq on so you can adjust that so it's pretty cool again so the sound quality let's turn that off oh no where's that gun see you well you want to go back you want to go forward so slow oh it takes an age see what i mean and by the time you get there you think well i didn't want to do that anymore i'm fed up with that i want to do this this is terrible isn't it i mean oh finally right let's skip again let's turn the volume up so we can actually hear so you can actually hear something okay to the birds [Music] sky at night you can see how long it takes from actually it says this is the try then it leaves a good few seconds playing it there's another uh i think i've noticed with some tracks which are spoken word tracks it'll cut the end off if it's on shuffle and um you think i'm going well why is it missed off the last couple of seconds of the track same with if it's uh if you've got a live album and you've got it secret you're playing the album from try one to the end um it'll pause in between you'll give you a little pause between the tracks so it's like putting silences between tracks which you don't really want well i don't want anyone i think well let's ruin the flow of the um the throat flow of the album if it's on the floor of the gig because it's a live gig uh genres never actually bother with that because obviously you put tags on your files um artist again that just gives you your artists that's your settings so you can do bluetooth i always use wired headphones um lock system also scan power auto power off back light off sleep off um that's another thing sort of like you it's just not very responsive and you've got to sort of like right i want to turn it off so you've got to press and hold it you know can't just like uh what i do like about the ipods is you press and hold the play thing bang cuts it off within a couple of seconds um so i don't know if you like listening to albums all the way through uh and you've got really good headphones then i would definitely uh get one of these you know but if you like shuffles and like different mixes and playlists and what have you i would um i wouldn't avoid it i just this i don't know it's just i'm not saying i can't get on with it but i just miss the usability um of a of an ipod so i shall be returning to it so thank you very much for the experience hustling kern i mean if the super expensive uh 3 000 pound um uh players uh just as um almost unuser friendly but as clunky as this then um i wouldn't really be very impressed i mean for the price i suppose but somehow i can say the sound quality is excellent so if you've got a really good expensive pair of headphones or mid-range good quality headphones then um it would be yeah an ideal um an id player especially because they've you've got you've got 64 gig on board and you can put a 64 uh gig card into the slot um so you know you could pick quite a lot of uh flax and lossless and waves in there so it's interesting that i say most played most played is number 11 by blue tonight that's because it always shuffles to it um there's the barbershop song that literally syndrome money changes everything celebrates summer yeah so it that that's an annoying thing and then if you skip again it goes again to another often played track it doesn't play something totally random so i don't know if that's some sort of um software issue that um the astellan care has because i know um you know when it was loading it said what version it was and i think it's on one point 1.03 now it's definitely changed from the first uh release of it which was back in i think in 2005. or 15 2015 not that 2005. uh it wasn't 3005 i know that um yeah so back in 2015. okay well thanks very much for watching um cheers bye

customer reviews review by aj i really like the presentation the carton is slightly off-center lettering slightly angled hard to tell if by design or just slightly off opening box it was beautiful cleanly packed seamless the unit is beautifully redesigned it has multi-angled corners so no more sharp edges everything is tightly measured every input even the case's alignment with the inputs is perfect the overall new ap80 pro is much sleeker and petite it has a much sleeker feel the screen is very responsive not so with my regular ap80 the sound is competitive with the shim lingam oh i am having a problem with the shim lingam oh the screens are becoming detached on two m0s i keep streaming with screen off so i bought this ap 80 pro to replace my confidence in the shim lingamo if i keep the mo in its case it will run forever probably just disappointed two screens are popping off the ap80 seems to be better built more solid more durable the sound is no better than the regular ap80 with the older high by system that only has aptx for which i have never once updated because the downloads do not work the pro is fine just the way it is one qualification the buttons still don't stick out from the case enough so they are hard to push especially if the case is on nice little player review by irving washington i'm using this with a pair of balanced kb ear kb 10 iems and a linsel tripow and 16 core silver plated cable wonders in and of themselves heretofore i've managed to struggle through life with 9.95 jvc gummi headphones but the stimulus check from trump is dan had me uh very stimulated the device has a dialogue screen which augments its very responsive graphic equalizer which in the scroll down menu they refer to as mseb this set of sliders facilitates an uncanny control over shaping the nuances of the sound tier individual preference the sense of detail and for lack of a better term space is truly extraordinary out of the box the ap80 pro will sound flat and tinny you have to roll up your sleeves and mess with the equalizer and or the settings in mseb and at least if you're like me you'll have to pick your jaw up off the floor i was able to pull out details i never heard before i used taco which is the second track on god rest his soul lyle may's eponymous solo album as of test track i could hear details in mark johnson's bass baselines and alejandro acuna's drums in an extremely subtle i.e quiet section of that track that i barely knew were there let that sink in he added this album came out in 1986 and i've had it on vinyl or cd ever since bravo it is i highly recommend the ap80 pro based on its sound quality alone that said i encountered one minor glitch the illustrations here on amazon show the device with a screen which i can't figure out how to get it appears to show the album cover while the track is playing perhaps there is a way to get the screen to display like that but two entire days in i haven't figured it out yet if anybody knows how to do this i'd welcome a response in the comments section thanks in advance what i did figure out was how to get a similar result with the album image screen you can get which is one with a time superimposed over the album art i thought that was kind of wonky so i one measured the screen 37 millimeters by 49 millimeters two went into photoshop and made a dark gray template of that exact size three created guides if memory serves at 0.138 inches 3.5 millimeters symmetrically left right and bottom 4 made a dot jpg of the album art at 30 millimeters by 30 millimeters five dropped it into the guides on the 37 millimeters by 49 millimeters template six flatten the image seven placed it into the screen savers folder the ap80 pro generates to go along with the sound files when you choose dynamic cover in the screensaver dialog ayton drum roll manage to get a fairly clean rendition of the cover art under the time of day numeral characters which pop out nicely against the dark gray background if i don't say so myself admittedly a minor point but i thought i'd share this in case anyone else is as anal about looking at their album covers on a digital music player as i am well one cd done several hundred to several thousand to go the don sent me a couple of 512 gigabytes cards to go with my new toy i'll be writing more in a week or two if you want more reviews on this product you can find the link in description that's all for this video and thanks for watching

how do you say this broadcast a chance a minute in which we settle down and see good all good all good while I'm showing the new little toy we have here with its new case the first minute is over there are some people connected thank you very much for be following us in this broadcast today I am going to do a little review I had planned on this new device that is a player audio was reported from portable audio having certain characteristics that for all those of us who like music It may be interesting to them and it is well about him karim n 3 pro I already did a little boxing a few days ago and I already had opportunity to try it and I will share what is my experience and the why I could recommend it or not in this case not depending on the people who want this information first of all we will explain that we tested it with these headphones the headphones that are nothing more and nothing less than some technical audio here I have your box for show them hs r 50 which has the following characteristics we are going to go for the characteristics as more general which is a difference of 47 or more and a frequency response of all five genes up to 45,000 hertz from there because it has a connection audio the long-awaited I hope it is reached to see here let's see [Music] is difficult but balanced and one of the advantages is that it comes with its bag so that we can keep it but mainly it has two cables it is a conventional cable stereo audio with [Music] and with 3.5 millimeter brooks for most audio devices but it also has a fairly balanced cable for this interesting feature that has 4.4 millimeters which is the one that we are going to use or the one that we can use with this device that has 4.4 and 3.5 output the same thing is that I have been looking for player that has the ability to play high resolution audio or whatever what they call hair is that it has a more or less moderate price since normally these equipments are very very expensive then we can say that there are low prices of this type of equipment intermediate prices and very very high that they can be around three thousand dollars four thousand dollars but this let's say it's a mid-priced one around good here in japan the equivalent to about 600 dollars however in other places I think that the price is different and the base price is about $ 500 then within This is from this price range from my point of view and it should be clarified that only my opinion is the one that offers better characteristics within this range of prices to explain why before continuing in the om boxing a few days ago I forgot I told them no because there is nothing in this box but what do you think there was and what there is is that this little the soft case like silicone that although it is not so impressive yes You do not have another, it is very convenient that you put it on, it also brought two stickers hair minis that audio and also enter the sub charger cable which is quite pretty nice because I have not got here like the golden metal parts quickly speaking del hair es audio is like a certification in which you are guaranteed that you can play the music with it at closer quality as it was recorded then many things come from here and for the many questions that and they are leaving as we occupy this device but well then talk a little about the characteristics of this device that has caught my attention first the price that was more or less within an intermediate range and what more more more called the attention is that good here we are going to learn says never beat imagine or is that he is not going to do the same thing again one of the things that most impressed of this device is that it has amplification to bulbs is a portable music player device that has physical bulbs are not emulators have bulbs as such and the amplification that bulbs those that you are familiar with with bulb amplification systems they will know and what they cannot know what the sound is different we are going to say that it is better or worse but we are going to say that it is different from what we could obtain with an amplification system solid state or transistor then Well, I'm going to connect the headphones with these to one of the outputs, which is the 3.5 headphone output that this one has stop just to teach them what chuck says here and that does reference to the vulgar I will leave one one is a song playing because that way the bulbs are going to light up here it says wait five seconds in what initialize the bulbs and as you can see here down here there are a few red bits that are telling us that the bulbs are on and they're done and it should already be ringing [Applause] the bulbs have two and apart from that It has two bulb modes which is the type of filter you are going to use so that sounds one way or another one of those filters more ultra line that means that the sound is very very flat and that it is going to be very faithful to the sound of the original recording that is the matter what I was commenting on the outputs have a 3.5mm headphone output no balanced which is where we can hear this type of amplification to bulbs or we could change it to an amplification of solid state also has a headphone jack 4.4 mm which is the balanced output that is also shared as a balance audio output and the 4.4 millimeter and apart has an output audio 3.5mm unbalanced here you have your usb type c connection for the load and transfer and let's put a little pause here to show you good he is going to get a little bit of this here extensive nora for micro sd If you are thinking of buying this device, I recommend that you also buy the original case looks pretty good protects it better than the one it already brings plastic the design is very cool it is leather and to have it well protected it is practically so far the only option we have is this or his [Music] the one that brings by default which is that of silicon that I had taught them here but this one well I didn't like it very much so okay much worth it that for a little more money you can put a better protection on this device since the idea of ​​this is to load it everywhere because it is portable then well worth it what else does this device have as it has a connection of bluetooth 5.0 which makes it very interesting to be able to connect either your computer or some bluetooth device like phone to connect it wirelessly and play for example phone music but listen to it with all the advantages that this player device has it has wifi but the operating system that has n Let's say it's the brand's native operating system and it's solely for play music does not have a complex operating system like android that devices but let's say here you have to enter one because currently many of this type of devices or like an android operating system that have many other options and that the Wi-Fi is used to, for example, listen to music on online streaming and other things no no we will not elaborate on it much but here the matter is from my particular point of view something that I need in this is listening to music and playing music for everything else i have a computer or I have a phone I don't need this but apart thanks to the bluetooth connection let's say face could i connect my phone with this and could already have what others are offering in addition to the prices the system is also being paid a lot Android operating pays for higher definition screens than for what I consider it is not necessary then the political system that brings this thing is quite quite intuitive there is no greater complexity you turn it on It is very fast, apart from that, of course with its many resources, it is very fast not really then i didn't even have to read the manual i just learned it and you you realize how it works it is very simple the screen is this just this part of here but it is enough for music playback from my point of view obviously and other things I liked about this device apart from the design because it avoids going to see it more than once we are going to take it again I think that although I have already taught them in the review but its design is completely very like a little rounded square. edges the finish is like matte black matte color with these little gold buttons It only has these buttons, which is the one button that you can also press and that has certain functions such as to block and thus advance the delay the stop or play house play has these exits on this side and the slot and everything the rest is like that, totally not to say keys inside the design the weight is incredible if it feels like one occupying something that is, it is not as extremely light which I feel it is an advantage because it lets us know that we are holding something sometimes When things are very light, we may or may not feel that we are doing something and another of the advantages of the size is that you can grab it quite comfortable because it is very comfortable to handle it and the buttons that are Here is the are extremely easy to use with one hand button the volume that apart is very soft this the buttons that are here too So in general terms it is a [Music] it is very very easy very easy to use both the operatively and physically occupy it audio outputs for all has a balanced output of 44.4 millimeters which is the more say the highest that at 32 or more gives us an output power of 800 thousand watts that already testing them in the stadium us that whose and penalistas more than 32 is it is a lot is enough and I think it would not be necessary more there will be those who say no or those who have equipment with higher impedance hearing aids then maybe require more power but in this case up to the moment is what I have that is more than enough Let's say the other output of the bulbs at 3.5 is also sufficient in a matter of power but above all the warmth of the sound the definition and everything is very very other than solid state amplification but the advantage is that we have the option of jumping from one to another either without balance or with balance and either to burgos or solid state it which I think turns this device into something very very very very versatile so how do we have the different options we could in reality be changing and we always have the sound we wanted And then where we have in fights about what is hair is that as I told you it is rather to try to reproduce the music in conditions as close to how they were recorded in this way you need special files to play faithfully the music then they are heavier and that's why it is that you require that your device also support storage as large in this case I have a sd of 128 girls but it could be up to one of 1 terabytes out there others are tastes I think for my taste with this device and the amplification output to bulbs It is very pleasant the sound is heard quite defined, especially there is a lot presence in the bass without losing the treble as at the moment from listening to everything that is recorded you hear it correctly well worked as well well in particular it does not happen like when you listen to everything at the same time [Music] but if you feel that separation of each sound that comes together to make Obviously the song then would not abound much in this matter of the of the audio in hair is because for that there are a thousand thousand forums and thousands of things that talk about it I can only tell you at this moment that this device due to its versatility due to its size due to its design due to its characteristics output power and everything I already mentioned is a very very good option of the a whole average price range to bring our music everywhere and even here this broadcast up to here this broadcast I'm going to leave the video here in the channel so that later they can see it but I wanted to share my experiences with this little device I hope you liked it If you liked it, share if you have not subscribed to this channel subscribe and we will keep talking about things like guitars music and whatever happening through these degrees greetings to all of Mexico from the sister republic from japan take good care take your precautions and see you next time broadcast the next video or whatever

Product description:

Astell&Kern is the ultimate Hi-Fi audio system

Astell&Kern is the ultimate digital music source that brings you Mastering Quality Sound or MQS. Astell means ‘Stars’ in Latin and Kern means ‘Center’ in German. We believe Astell&Kern is the center of music.

Original music performances recently have been captured in digital almost exactly as they were performed due to new and advanced recording technologies currently available. These great-sounding recordings are mainly listened to in inferior sound formats, such as MP3 or streaming services. With the debut of the MP3 format, music lovers scarified the quality of the sound for the convenience of being able to carry their music collection wherever they went. Because MP3 heavily compresses the original file for the sake of convenience, you only hear inferior vocals and instruments, and the full soundstage and ambience from the original recordings is missing. The movement of the original performance often disappears when listening to compressed MP3 music. After agonizing over these issues, Astell&Kern was our solution to the poor quality of musical sound for the sake of portability, and our way to ultimately bring back the original sound quality of the music, MQS, back to music artists, recording engineers and professionals.

Astell&Kern pursuit is to provide the natural and original sound without distortion. It offers almost the exact presence with tiny details you wouldn’t have noticed from other music systems by playing back high-resolution music bit for bit, exactly as it was recorded. The exact sound without missing any bit of the live performance in recordings is what Astell&Kern is known for.
