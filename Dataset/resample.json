get my mp3s into my high five systems Ive tried to so in US but that hadnt really worked out for me because in like the way that it controlled I prefer something with more physical controls actual buttons I compress that I can keep in the hifi rack that Ive got I listed out my requirements and I bought something that I thought would suit me but unfortunately it didnt work out so in the end I sent it back and I replaced it with something that costs more than twice as much its pretty expensive this its these Sony H a ps1 you can see the prices at the bottom of the screen there although to be honest I dont feel ripped off I actually do like this device let me show it to you inside the box weve got this card that says weve got a little stick inside the box as well a memory stick which has got some high res audio files on it weve also got a Quick Start Guide got a few more things there you can see the memory stick in there as well as the batteries for the remote control power lead and an Ethernet cable but this will connect over Ethernet or WiFi but its got an Ethernet cable in the box just to help you out and weve got a little simple remote control here as well now the device itself is very heavy its very well made it feels like a brick I mean its a good quality piece of kit but it should be for the price this is actually a proper system you can see there weve got HDD 500 gig hard drive in it and its got 40 watts amps as well on there its supposed to be an allinone system you can see the bottom note says audio player system you could just have this on its own connect it up to some speakers and use it as it is however Im actually connecting it into an existing high five some bypassing all that you can use it as a digital analog converter as well out sir USB plugs you can put extra storage on there to expand the Foundry gigs out got Ethernet weve got coax in optical in but Im just using the out on this one weve got two another two ins at the bottom there as well and logins oh and also connecting up this Ethernet cable so Ill just spin it around put it in mice so as you can see that it fits like a glove it looks really nice it fits in with all the other stuff Ive got the remote perhaps not so nice made out a plastic with rubber buttons on it but its got the controls on there that you want and no more theres a little memory stick there I have to put that in the back up that USB stick it goes in the back there with those extra highres tracks on it so you can try those out straight away without having to put any of your own music on there so Ill connect it up turn it on and as you can see there it comes on its got a little bit of a boot up top its got a fan in here that you cant hear but it does have a fan in the back its very silent menus lot nicer on this one than the previous thing choose your language easy onscreen explanation as to whats going on you can have it sort of working standby so it can pick up music off your network while its in standby and you can choose wired or wireless setup and unlike the previous device no necessity to reboot when youre switching between those however one thing youve got to watch out for its trying to format that little USB stick that I put in the back so you get a select notes that otherwise you lose the things that are on it which are those HD tracks as well as the software for windows right selecting my wireless network here and then Im just going to put my password and using this onscreen keyboard as you can see its like a jog shuttle wheel out that you can spin then click into select things right so everythings okay there so well click OK and close and look weve got a firmware update this was a firmware update with everything nowadays in there so lets install that first of all and while thats going on lets just have a look at the piece of software that were going to have to use to transfer these files across I use a Mac and it says that the Mac software has to be downloaded separately however the address it gave there was nothing there so but I did manage to find it on the Sony website so click to download and again for all not found so Ive got a bit worried at this point Im thinking Im not going to better transfer the files across to that hard drive however I did find the software in the European store downloaded that installed it and then what happens is it finds the device on your network you choose what folders you want to copy across to that internal hard drive on the device and what files you want to copy across what types of files now once youve done that you can start it off going it does take a long time look at the top right there counting up I say counting up nothings happening yet but just look how slowly does care when it starts counting one out of all those tracks thats all about tracks are going to be copied across in fact to copy all my music collection across to this device so can entire weekend you can see there at the top of the screen its counting up from 103 104 this is over an Ethernet cable which is slightly faster on this slightly than WiFi but remember you dont have to do this once the first time you get it thats it after that after about you just uploading the old track or add an album every now and then it goes into some sort of standby mode so its not using all your power while its doing this anyway when its got all the music on Ill show you how it works on the right here weve got this control thats that wheel that we can spin around we got a playpause kind of back and we got a home button those are the buttons Im using those ones in the middle this one on the right this big volume button its kind of dampened its got a good feel to it Im not going to use that because Im not using the inbuilt amp Im using a different amp with this so Im just using there out on the Left weve got a power button and headphone socket and a nice be clear screen and of course we can control it all with that remote and use it that way or we can use these buttons on the screens Im going to show you how it works and see here we can spin down we got this nice little onscreen graphics changing as we go into the different menus its got great aesthetics this thing it looks really nice its a beautiful piece of kit so lets go into one of these things here you see at the bottom in external input thats if youre using as a hifi device on its own you can use those lines in our optical lens and itll work as a really good digital analog converter now go into the internet radio which is something Ive never really paid attention to before Ive had internet radios and never really liked them however this one its so easy to use Ive actually started using internet radio you can pick your genres and things Ill just go into the old stations here look how many stations there are to choose from I mean its ridiculous you could never listen to all of these so hopefully you managed to find a couple of radio stations you want theres a few different ways of doing that you can go by genre or even bitrate and things like that and then put them in your favorite stations folder here so youve got easy access to them in the future so Ill put a few in there now Ill just click on one of those you can see it loads up starts playing straight away and you get some really pretty decent quality you can see the kilobits a second at the bottom there actually sounds pretty good but of course I didnt buy this device to be an internet radio I wanted it so I could play back all my music collection conveniently and easily so lets have a look how good it is at doing that I can pick John Roos artists albums or tracks if we go into albums you can see at the top of the screen Ive got 915 albums in here if I click on that youll see 18000 tracks theres a lot of very large compilations in amongst those you can scroll through these really easily theres a sort of clicky feel to that knob there so you can just stop it exactly where you want lets try playing back talking all that jazz by steps of sodding which is on there in full gear album so Ill just look for that now in full gear spin down track 13 talking all that jazz and there we go playing straight away the good thing about having it on an internal hard drive everything is quick notice weve got 320 kilobits a second on that one there Ill show you some high res audio that are downloaded I got some from HD tracks calm we can download albums these higher res so well go and pick one of these what what did I get now it was Physical Graffiti thats it so lets have a look here play track WOD you can see there thats a flack file which is a presumably its supposed to sound better which it does I mean hell so great everything sounds great now let me show you how these buttons work to move tracks you can just spin that little knob a little bit just slightly itll move to the next track its like a skip forward I cos you can skip back if you want if you want to pick a particular track once your album spin it a bit and you can see all the tracks off the album later influence you so you can jump down to any particular track you on a plate in addition to that when youre playing it you can just click it in and youve got the option to shuffle all the tracks or all the albums if you want repeat them and you can add favorites where you can put a little heart next to something that shows up in another folder where all your favorite music collects this dsee thing is this is supposed to make rubbishy sounding mp3 sound better by adding in extra detail it does actually sound better if youve got a low kill a bitrate mp3 and we can also adjust the treble and bass here I think that only really works though if youve got it going back through its own speakers not through another device like I have you can delete tracks of course as well now this sends me thing Ill show you what that is lets just jump outta here and I could have just press home by the way rather than pressing that a few times so sends me channels or things where you can choose a kind of mood I suppose that you want so lets see we got morning daytime evening night etc you can see how many tracks are in each one of those its figure this out itself which probably not always getting it right but if you click on one of those things lets go for Midnights itll play something back that its things you might want to hear at midnight I suppose a good maybe for parties things like that stick it in a certain mode just have it play tunes in the background I suppose its quite a nice little feature although to be honest I prefer to pick the record that I want to listen to but if you just want to have a random record playing its a pretty good option now you can also use an app with this of course I wont be doing this Im not interested in using an app but the app does give you extra features as well you can rename tracks and move them about change the genres and things change the settings but as you can see here it works really well as well if you were into apps and it enables you to get into the settings and all the other options that youve seen so far but for me this device is really all about the fact that I can now access every single CD that Ive ever bought within just a couple of seconds you can see I can scroll through my entire collection theyre not all mine by the way theres quite a few of the Misses ones in there all the bad ones are hers all the interesting and cool stuff thats mine but you can see I can just pick a record here very easily just click on that and pick one of Stevie Wonders classics there we go thatll do living for the city just one of 18000 tracks I can pick with a quick spin of a wheel now YouTube comments have tended to go ballistic whenever Ive spent a large amount of money on anything but dont worry you dont have to buy one of these I bought it with my money and Im very happy in fact its one of my favourite things anyway thats it for the moment as always thanks for watching"}

"video_description": "A look at a HiRes prerecorded physical music format  MQS SD\nThere is some important info in this video description text box \n\nMQS SD is sold in South Korea  HK for use with the Astell  Kern HiRes Personal Audio Players which feature MicroSD card storage slots \n\nAstell  Kern use MQS to define HD Audio in a FLAC format with a 24bit encoding According to their specs the KHz sample rate can vary depending on the source between 48KHz and 192KHz The Beatles LP seems to be a special case because its just 441 KHz and I suspect this is because thats the best source currently available \n\nBack in 2014 manufacturers and record companies got together to define a system to code HD audio files Heres what they came up with \n\nMQA  Taken from an Analogue Master Source\nMQC  Sourced from a 16bit 441KHz CD master and upsampled\nMQD  Sourced directly from a Direct Stream Digital DSD Master\nMQP  Sourced from a minimum 20bit master with a minimum 48KHz sample rate\n\nI havent seen these in use anywhere since perhaps the descriptions were considered too verbose when you then combine them with the filetype AIFF ALAC FLAC or WAV \n\nSo what is MQS Well as the video shows its not exactly nailed down in AKs description and I suspect that its just a simplification of the existing system \n\nIf you look at this South Korean music download site httpwwwgrooverskrmqschartdomesticd1091701920 you can see they use MQS to identify HD tracks and then use a code like MQS 24192 to identify the quality The logo stands out in red on the page and the system is slightly simpler than stating a file is HD Audio MQD FLAC 24192\n\nWhether the average human ear is capable of hearing the difference between all these things   I havent a clue and I dont have a horse in that raceIm just interested in collecting formats \n\nIm particularly interested in physical packed prerecorded musicmusic in a box sold as a retail product This is the most recent packaged music format as far as I know Yes SD cards and FLAC are not newbut putting them together in a nice box with coverart and a booklet isand thats what this video is aboutsomething you probably werent aware existed\n\nSNAKEOIL  Its a flippant joke at the vague definition of the benefits of MQS over normal FLAC HiRes audio filesis there really any difference It appears MQS is just 24 bit FLAC \nI AM NOT SAYING HIRES AUDIO IS SNAKEOIL just that I can see no discernible technical differences between 24 bit FLAC and MQS Perhaps there is oneand if so AK need to do a better job of defining exactly what the specific benefits of MQS difference are  \n\nHere is a link to all the MQS SD Card Albums \nhttpmallgrooverskrfrontproductlistphpcode001000000000listnum12sortblock0gotopage1\n\nI bought my Beatles MQS SD Album on ebay  heres a link that should find any for sale httpsgooglMMOKDM\nDont overpay though \n\nIncidentally theres also another file format called MQA  heres some info on that httpwwwsoundandvisioncomcontenthireslabelunamasrelease10mqarecordings This seems to have no connection to the MQA categorisation I mentioned above which describes the origin of a recording   like AAD or DDD you used to see on CDs This MQA without the dash actually seems to be a separate format that is backwardly compatible with some other formatsits all very confusing \n\nUPDATE \nNo one has to buy these Your existing choice of music delivery medium will continue to function irrespective of the success or failure of MQS SD I didnt anticipate that showing an obscure music delivery format that is only marketed in South Korea for playback of audio via the micro SD card slot on a highend digital media player would be so controversial\n \nSUPPORT\nThis channel can be supported through

as the machines that play them now the most recent format that came out that had mass market success will have been the compact disc since the CD there been other formats that have been introduced but theyve generally been met with public apathy weve had things like the digital audio tape the mini disc digital compact cassette si CD DVD audio and bluray audio now while it was clear from the off the bluray audio was never going to be a massmarket success I am fond of the format more often than not the titles were released on it would have been multiple disc compilations on other formats but could all fit on one bluray disc of course you could play it on any bluray player the audio was highres and this one that I got this Rolling Stones compilation has 50 tracks on it and actually cost less at the time I bought it than the CD compilation and also comes with a download code for 320 kilobits per second mp3 files and of course you get a larger buckler in this and you will get inside the CD but despite all Im sure there are plenty people watching this whove never heard of bluray audio and unfortunately I think by now its largely fizzled out as a format but for a while that was the last prerecorded audio format that have been released but now theres a new one let me show it to you and here it is that youd be forgiven for thinking that this is a CD well the box is the same size and shape as a CD case of course this is the Beatles one compilation its got the same track listing on here you get if you were to buy this on a CD this format is known as mqs well at least its kind of known as thats a little bit complicated theres only been perhaps half a dozen titles released on it so far a bug those titles were a Pavarotti compilation and album by Jason Mraz and another one by Bon Jovi but this is the only one I was interested in and as you can see this is imported it comes from South Korea and the format were talking about is in the end here and if I get that out you can see straight away it is a microSD card I was happy to see that theyve put the album bar on the actual microSD card itself and thats not a sticker thats actually printed on the surface you get a booklet inside the box as well which Id imagine you also get if you were to buy this on CD although I dont own this compilation on CD its also stuck in the back of there you can remove that but anyway who is or what is mqs well it comes from a company called Astle and kern theyre a South Korean manufacturer of highend personal audio players that play highres files and their description of mqs is as follows NQ s or mastering quality ser refers to a high definition 24bit 48 to 192 kilohertz sound generated with the mqs technique which processes the original sound file during a mastering stage the final stage of soundmaking mqs delivers a fullbodied sound close to the original sound source provided with more than six point five times amount of data that CD sound has mqs lets you experience an incomparable and ultimate sound performance or to sum up each snakeoil anyway Ill put it inside the computer here we put the microSD card in this SD card reader and pop it into the computer well just have a look at the files are on here to see exactly what you get well its just a normal micro SD card formatted as fat32 the audio files on this album take up 897 megabytes of storage and theyre all FLAC files if we inspect one of those files we can see that for this one theyve been recorded 44 point 1 kilohertz at 24 bits now 441 is exactly the same as a compact disc but a compact disc is 44 per one and 16 bits this one is 24 bits which means its a little bit better quality and those specs match the Beatles USB stick that came out a few years ago that had all their albums on it also at 44 point 1 kilohertz up 24 bits I think thats the highest quality that the Beatles albums have ever been released in and of course with these being standard FLAC files it means you can play them back on any piece of hardware or software that supports that format which answers a question are how did biomart I didnt know whether mqs was actually a format or just specific to a still in Kern but though its flat files but at 24 bits Im sure there are some people out there that are experiencing deja vu at the moment and dont worry not going mad somebody has tried this idea before some disk introduced the slot music format a number of years ago where they released prerecorded albums on one gigabyte microSD cards those microSD cards contain 320 kilobits per second mp3 files and of course youll put those micro SD cards and compatible mp3 players or mobile phones the microSD cards themselves came in these nice little plastic boxes that had albemarle on them although the micro sd card itself didnt have any art on there and you also got a little USB SD card reader I suppose then that raises a question of why try and reintroduce the idea of selling prerecorded music on a delivery format thats previously failed as a way to sell prerecorded music well I suppose things are a little bit different there in that were dealing with high res or HD audio files but its probably quite a bit easier just to go on a website like HD tracks and download the files from there although a quick check reveals they dont currently have the Beatles albums available to download of course a stolen Kern who are behind this format do sell the personal audio players that have microSD card slots on them so I suppose theyre thinking customers could just pick these up and slot them in and they dont have to mess around with a computer and after all whos it really harming this is only a very nice thing thats only available in South Korea I dont think any probably people buy their music on microSD cards if thats what they want to do and I think this Beatles compilation is probably going to end up being pretty collectible in years to come so they have it as far as Im aware the mqs micro sd card is the last pre recorded music format thats been introduced unless of course you know different and if you do please put some information in the comments anyway thats it for the bowl burn as always thanks

Captions": " at the end of March Toshiba held a press conference to announce they were going to release a highres cassette player in Japan this announcement caused equal amounts of interest confusion and amusement reading into it a little bit further it appears the device has a button on it that when pressed promises to make plain old cassette sound as good as high res audio so the big question is does it work well lets find out now whilst Ive imported my machine from Japan it is currently only supposed to be sold within the domestic market its not really for export but if youre interested the model number is tya k1 and as well as being able to play cassettes its also got a compact disc player and it can play files off SD cards or USB sticks those files can be mp3s flax or WAV and its also got an AM and FM radio now although I will try out those high res digital formats the real reason I bought this is because Im intrigued as to how good a cassette player it is and whether or not this up conversion of cassettes really does make a difference so lets get it out of the box and take a good look at it now of course its got a Japanese instruction booklet but any parts Im slightly confused about it Ill just translate using the Google Translate app now it does feel a lot more lightweight and less substantial than I was hoping for very plasticky on the front weve got the cassette on the top is the CD player at the bottom right weve got the USB socket and the SD card reader across the top weve got a vu meter and theres two ways speakers there you can see the tweeters in the corner around the back weve got ports for those as well but theres no battery compartment on here this thing doesnt run on batteries you have to run it from a wall power supply and being Japanese it runs on a hundred volts it comes with an infrared remote control and notice next to my finger there is the allimportant upconvert button that when pressed should make sources that arent highres sound highres or at least thats the theory theres also one of those upconvert buttons on the front of the machine and next to that are three record buttons youve got the option to either record to SD cards or USB sticks and that will record as a 192 kilobits per second mp3 file or you can record onto the tape on the front left of the machine next to the power button are the buttons to choose between the various audio sources youve got a choice of CD amfm radio tape SD card USB or line input the input is on the front of the machine its a three and a half millimeter mini jacket is next to the headphone output and the microphone input and to the right of there is a switch to choose between normal and high position tapes more buttons again on the top of the machine on the left hand side its the transport controls as a whole to alter middle its the controls for the clock and timer and then over on the right hand side weve got the choices for the radio presets as well as the tuning and the volume controls now because it runs on a hundred volts and coming out to my wall somewhere around about 230 volts Im using it with a stepdown power transformer of course you dont have to use it with one thats this beef is just the one Ive going here at the moment now switching it on you can see the display comes on on the front it lights up and its looking for a CD it cant find it but notice its got Japanese text on there to tell you that but when you switch it to tape it says no tape strangely enough so a little bit mixed up there you cant change the language in this it just is what it is I havent changing the date and time on here though although I believe if youre in Japan I think it pulls that through from the radio now talking of the radio its not a very good shooter on this one Ive noticed even with the Ariel fully extended I struggle to get things tuned in now it is using the full frequency range Japanese radios used to just use the bottom bit but a few years ago they extended it to the full range so its the same frequencies as I get any normal radio in this country except it just doesnt really seem to pull in a very strong signal at all so not a very good radio but were not here to look at the radio were here to look at the cassette player so lets do that now coincidentally at the same time the cassette player arrived this tape turned up in the post as well this is retro grooves  from Anders anchor Jensen Ill be able to play this without hitting a youtube copyright match Ill put a link to his website in the video description text box but lets just take a listen Music Applause Music well that was underwhelming the upconversion didnt seem to make any difference at all to me there but lets have a look at this cassette mechanism to see how good it is and it isnt good its very lowend but I cant really say lowend I suppose because its just the end because these are the last types of cassette mechanisms that are made dont force you all the good ones they stop making those many years ago this is it this is the standard now and its not very good if we look at my proper machine that Ive got here its got a three head closed loop dual capstan quartz lock direct drive with Dolby s all of those are not features on this machine its just a very basic unimpressive cassette mechanism now looking inside here theres the usual sensors that detect whats going on with the tape for example this one on the left detects whether or not youve pulled the right protect notch out of it this one in the middle is the one that detects whether or not using metal tapes because of course metal tapes of those two extra holes in the middle now the reason its detecting them isnt because it can play them its so it cant play them it says theres no tape in there when you put a metal tape in this machine because the machine is only designed to play either type 1 or type 2 tapes and it can only play type 2 youre not recording on those youve got to select to switch to the bottom but if you want to record youre only supposed to record on type 1 tapes theyre just moving away from cassette briefly for a moment I want to have a look at this high res audio business up put some files on this USB stick on here Ive got a mp3 as well as FLAC WAV and AIFF now its quite happy playing the flacc and the wave it completely ignored there AIFF pretended it wasnt there and the mp3 played fine and that was at 320 kilobits a second initially I thought it wasnt capable of displaying the file names until I discovered that there were additional buttons on the remote control and theres a display button here that when pressed will change the display to show the file names but to say that display really does seem very old and speery its not very pleasant to look at brandnew device it looks like something that came out 20 years ago its also got a really narrow viewing angle you pretty much have to be looking at it deadon straight to be able to read the text and I should also mention these recording functions in here to record you just hold down one of those for a couple of seconds so for example you could record a CD onto a tape or you could record a tape to the USB stick which is exactly what Im doing now and if you look on the USB stick you find that you get a separate record folder its labeled rec presumably in reference to the Spanish horror film and the files it records are 192 kilobits a second mp3s another function that just has a button on the remote but not on the machine itself is EQ apparently this button if you hold it down will activate a mic echo but if you just press it it switches the sound quality not very specific there I think its perhaps supposed to be a little bit like if you were to mess around with the settings on your graphic equalizer but of course its just got the one setting and if you activate the EQ well I couldnt really tell any difference ago and it seemed the same to me as before and you can even combine the EQ with the upconvert if you want to but again Im just not getting it I just really Im not seeing your I should say not hearing whats there I even tried it over my headphones I sort of closing my eyes and everything its just not really making any difference at all as far as I can make out but what exactly is this upconvert business supposed to be doing even if Im unable to hear it well according to the Toshiba website it does this and as far as I can make out that is a very similar function to the one in my Sony H a ps1 digital music player which has a function called dsee HX and dsee and if you switch those on there supposed to replace something thats been lost from the original audio I dont exactly know quite whats going on but all that when I switch it on it does sound a little bit better so Ill just leave it switched on so Id like to give that function another go on this machine this time Im going to try on a CD this is from candy apple blue theres a link to them in the video description text box first off Ill just play the C normally and then Ill go back and play the same section with the upconversion switched on Music well Ive been through too many nights with you to give you up without a fight right lets listen again but this time with the up conversion activated Music well Ive been through too many nights with you to give you up without a fight now theres an obvious flaw in that video demonstration its the fact that I recorded the CD by the headphone output on the Toshiba player as a PCM file then imported that into my editing package while I put this whole video together at which point I outputs the video and it comes out with an AAC audio track I then upload that to YouTube and you then listen to a stream version of that well it has an even lower quality than the version that I uploaded so its never going to sound even as good as the original CD so trying to determine the difference between a CD and an upscale version of the CD is going to be impossible via YouTube however I got to say personally here and listening to it could not tell any difference at all either over the speakers or via the headphone output so just to doublecheck that that up convert button was doing something I imported audio of a cassette being played in the machine with the standard version and with the up convert button pressed in into audacity and then I compared the waveforms between the two versions and there is a very slight difference so pressing that button is doing something although whether its something youd be able to hear I very much doubt looking at the very slight difference between the two but what Ill do Ill put both versions available for you to download and you can have a listen for yourself and see if you can spot the difference now being for the Japanese market weve got a microphone input on here so we can sing along with CDs and its got the appropriate vocal down button which should mute the vocal so you can sing over the top of the backing track although it doesnt work very well just have a listen to this Music now going back to cassettes theres one feature that I thought was on this machine that either doesnt work or it doesnt have and its the ability to skip to the next track order tape now this is a feature that Ive got on this machine the idea is you press the button rather than the fastforward button and it skips on once it finds a blank section of tape between two tracks it then rewinds a little bit and you can get to the next track I thought this machine had that function because when you press the button you get the indicator onscreen which says its going to the next track thats the standard icon for that but it doesnt go to the next track it just goes all the way to the end of the tape and doesnt stop it doesnt matter how long a gap there is between tracks either so it just seems like it doesnt have that feature even though it looks like it does now Im going to be doing something a little bit different here normally when I review audio equipment I just sort of say well he sounds ok to me or it doesnt sound good at all thats about the limit of my scientific tests well this time Im going to be doing something a little bit more scientific Im going to record some audio onto this type wante because thats the only type of tape that this machine is supposed to be able to record on and on there Im gonna put a sine wave that Im recording off the USB stick as well as some pink noise now Ive also recorded those same things with my main Sony machine onto some chrome tape which it can play and Ill put that in here as well and Im going to record both of those being played back into this PCM recorder and Im sending them off to someone I know that chap is Hugo he runs the Walkman archive as well as stereo to go and the reason Ive enlisted his help is because hes a bit of an expert at looking at audio files and Im really down into the detail of how different tapes for example perform in comparison to each other hes got all the equipment for this so Ive sent him off these files and he sent me about the results so lets take a look at them right so first Wow and flutter or speed irregularities that kind of wobbly sound that youd notice if it gets too high well on my Sony where the tape is recorded itself and being played back from the Sony its come roundabouts naught point naught six or something not brilliant but you know pretty good you wouldnt notice that at all whereas on the Toshiba where the tape that its recorded and played back we coming in at naught point one ish or just over maybe dont point to at times its not looking good anyway you definitely notice that so wobbly kind of sound going onto frequency response well this line ideally is supposed to be completely flat all the way across showing that its got a full frequency response from the low end up to the high end my Sonys dropping off a little bit on the left but again is a pretty good result overall now if we have a look at a p thats been recorded in the toshiba and playback through the table you can see its going up and down like a mountain and it drops off on the left hand side it drops off on the right on side and its a bit wobbly in the middle so really were only get in the middle of the frequency range if we listen to the tape that i recorded on the sony being played back on the toshiba it does improve it a little bit we shows that recording a better quality sound plays back a little bit better but its still a bit of a mountain in the middle there not good at all now if we just have a look at the tape that ive recorded with the upconversion switched on well that barely makes any difference at all it kind of varies the shape a little bit but really theres no extra frequencies represented in the audio and then going back to the sony one finally just to show you what he should really have looked like so overall then those results just show that its not a good cassette player in fact any decent deck from the seventies eighties or nineties would sound better than this so then that got us thinking for a bit of fun why not put it headtohead against what is quite probably the best home cassette recorder ever made Applause Music Applause Music yes its the legendary nakanishi dragon and the one that Hugo Scott has even been modified so its even better than the factory spec what were going to do were not going to record busted its a track from the YouTube audio library hes going to record it on his TDK si X Im gonna record it on a TDK si 90 hell be recording it in his nakanishi dragon and playing it back from there Im recording it in the sony k triple 3 and playing it back from the toshiba machine now neither of us can use Dolby noise reduction because the Toshiba machine is incapable of decoding it so these are just type 2 tapes being played back on two different machines so lets do a bit of a comparison Music its hard to know how well thats going to come across on YouTube after all we start off with a 320 kilobits a second mp3 file we then convert that onto analog tapes and then put it back into the digital domain again so hopefully the differences are still apparent by the time you listen to it at the other end what problem I had putting that bit together that I didnt anticipate was the fact that our shiba machine was running just a little bit too quickly so by the time the track reached their end the machines were out of sync with one another just have a listen to this Music now Ive got to stress putting this machine up against the Nakamichi dragon was really just a bit of fun it was nothing to be taken too seriously after all the machine is in a completely different price range in Japan its twentyone thousand two hundred and ninety nine yen which currently equates to about a hundred and forty two UK pounds or a hundred ninety four US dollars but if you decide to import one youll pretty much double those prices so in summing up Im a little bit annoyed by this device though its not expensive over in Japan but despite that fact it doesnt really do what it sets out to do for example they call it a high res audio device and while it can play lossless FLAC files I challenge anyone to be able to spot the difference between those and 192 kilobits a second mp3 when theyre being played back through this and I havent yet mentioned those speakers they sound like they look theyre small plastic speakers they arent terrible but they dont impress in any way and I can see why they limited the volume to such low levels as this case has a tendency to rattle and resonate when reproducing certain bass notes the overall construction is about as plastic as it can get and the only bits of metal are the speaker grilles and their aerial its not the good kind of plastic either the finish is about as low end as it goes I mean I nearly cut my finger on the sharp edge of the cassette door and you can see on the CD lid at the back where its been taken off the mold and I really dont understand why theyd make a portable machine but theyre not give it the ability to run off battery power and Ive seen better LCDs on a tamagotchi and while I do like a vu meter the one on here is just for show because the machine doesnt have manual recording level controls and finally that big headline feature the upconversion could you hear any difference if so youre doing better than I am so its another sad day for cassettes a former that still has the ability to sound amazing but its just not going to do it on a machine like this so my apologies for ending on such a down note but Ive done what I set out to do at the beginning that was to find out whether the Toshiba T Y ek1 sounded any good and the answer is no so thats it for the Bourbon has always thanks for watching Music you so whats all this Ill keep hearing about hires music hires music yeah its written on the gold sticker on the hifis in the window of Laskys hall you mean highres doer yes luckily for you I know all about high res music so thats me anything right what does it mean I dont remember music having any kind of res before well high res means that its got more res much more than low res music which means it sounds better higher things are always best like cholesterol so a CDS clusters high res there are CDs get with the times old man but I upgraded my record collection to CDs because they were supposed to sound better ah but then you ripped those CDs to mp3s and mp3 sound rubbish so Ill just go back and play my old CDs no theyre not high res theyre all 16bit its like listening to pixel art how many Bitsys i rez then all of them at least a million well and what hires music can you buy well its mostly stuff that they recorded on to tape in the 60s and 70s why is that well the 80 stuff was digitally mastered so it could only ever sound as good as a CD you seem strangely knowledgeable about this subject I read an article but still its out of character its like youve got an agenda look just go with it oh okay then what about new music theres that being recorded in high rest then do they even make new music I dont know I havent seen Top of the Pops for years I think it got replaced by minecraft alright so if I want to get into high res what do I have to buy well you need to buy a new amplifier and speakers is and your leader source like barbecue your room will need to be acoustically perfect and youll need to connect it all up with diamond coated cables that have been kissed by the Pope this sounds expensive ironically it is well is that ironic because the kind of people who can afford it ah your age but they come here how I rest what exactly old people ears cant hear all the frequencies so you might as well be listening to an eight truck flippin Eck what do you be able to hear it properly probably but Im not going to spend a fortune just to listen to some stuffy old music thats recorded by hippies right so let me get this straight I could afford it but I cant hear it you cant afford it but you could hear it but youre not interested yeah that pretty much sums it up it sounds like its gonna sell like hotcakes"}
