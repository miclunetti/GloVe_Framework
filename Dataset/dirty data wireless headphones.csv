looking at headphones it's not very often that you get a completely new form factor in the headphone territory in the headphone segment we have earbuds we have over ear headphones we have on ear headphones of course with a headband associated we have the full wireless stuff of course the very popular ear pods now air pod anyhow here we end up on this a completely new take it's called human headphones and when you wear it that's what it looks like it's crazy how is it on there how does it stay put that's what's happening right here she's wearing it he's wearing it for this to work out it's gonna have to deliver sound quality above what the earbud is capable of big big sound full-size speaker drivers so doesn't I say look we're not trying to be as portable as the earbud but we're gonna give you the sound quality listen out loud put them together to activate a powerful Bluetooth speaker okay so they also become a Bluetooth speaker so now you got a portable speaker as well which is on you at all times okay use your voice to make calls send text and translate to 13 different languages built-in translator you could use that Jack on your travel can't believe highly requested from you individuals out there in the world look at that that's the thing that's the package it's so interesting oh my good it's like a little capsule how do I even oh you just pull it apart look at that they're on and ready to pair I guess when I peel this off they're just in pairing mode that's crazy simple oh that's some memory foam action you see how that stays sitting down for a second if I guess this is four but each individual is gonna be a bit different from that stand point so that moves around like that I see microphones on the outside how does this go let's find out oh okay so your is fitting in there uh I should say I'm already having a very visitor experience well first of all I look crazy they're saying ready to pair but they also went into a pass-through mode so right now I have crystal-clear audio like you guys myself my own voice and you guys they're almost like hearing aids right now talk jack oh my god here we go let's get the human app there's this install thing that I definitely should have paid attention to pull the hook that goes around what they're calling the ear root you know you had an ear roof no you did it I feel like this guy with the slightly longer hair it blends for him whether I'm wearing a hat or no hat that is you are gonna see that and this is your charge cable this is definitely proprietary it's a nice little dock and it's USB see on the other end a nice simple power brick to go with it fit attachment pads okay so these are also a memory foam so you have options there these are magnetic fit - there's a really lot of magnetic stuff going on and then look at the travel pouch jack that's kind of nice isn't it feels like a suede sort of finish there's a silica gel inside I'm not gonna throw it jack it just wouldn't be very nice look how happy she is you see that's what happens you buy these that's what happens I trust I trust let's go pair it up okay so this is nice this is just as easy as pulling them apart they turn on and connect to the last pair device that's it I love that I like that that type of interface you don't even need to think about you just close them down that's it can I just say these are expensive I feel like you're feeling that right now I feel you probably feel that as you saw the package come out what are we looking at price-wise Willie do something they've got a price to him don't they 260 dollars he says anything he was amplified when he said that because I heard it's a hefty price tag it might be the future though so let's let's think about all right touch controls tap to pause media playback tap again to resume swipe forward to go forward so I back to the back swipe up tank respawn it's a typical touchpad it's a common interface now press and hold either headphone to amplify outside sound if I was playing music they would shut off to isolate me a little bit but then I would just tap over here I just be like okay let's continue the conversation I'm just tapping my module oh now you're shut off now I'm muffled now it's terrible and now you're back it's night and day blend mode so tapping the blend button in the app will toggle outside sound amplification for greater ambient awareness and this now has become like a feature we expect in high-end headphones we want this we need this tapping the speaker button on your app allows you to transform your headphones into a portable speaker it's a nice little touch I mean the teenagers in the cafeteria well they might have a cool product here let's leave it in blend mode and we'll go find some tunes that's step one we're gonna listen to some music can I do 60 soul is that alright with you I'll get there they're way better than your buds fine they sound way better than air pods like way better than air pods it's a bigger speaker right I like you know I like technology you know every so often yeah I just sit over here this and not and then this comes along and I'm like yeah headphones they're not done yet either nothing's done yet everything can be improved almost everything could be rethought we can't think of this differently and I'm having a different experience right now let me just okay so other gestures volume yeah volume okay that works let's go next nice track oh I don't know guys I'm feeling some I'm having him I'm having something happen here I'm tingling it might be Sam Cooke I don't know it might be the fact that I feel unencumbered by any devices like I feel feel like I could bob and weave low time coming but I know I don't know that they're gonna be for everyone for me this is not bothersome at all I do feel them on top of the ear it could they be even more invisible could they be even lighter maybe is it the hybrid they were aiming at I think it is we got around the world remember that song that is some old school that's thick that's hit it sounds good man it's got bass to it I mean there's bass there oh we got a due speaker mode real quick class headphones together to enable speaker okay boom speaker suite what that's it they know that they're in speaker mode you can't do that to me you can't do that to me the smartphone speaker is just as good as that it doesn't sound that good that's kind of weird I think that was one of those bonus elements where they just wanted to be like Annie can do to make it difficult for me and my company to continue to do business the way that I'm doing it I have to start to look at alternative track it sounds like a smart phone speaker guys that's not why you're buying this that shouldn't be why you're buying this don't expect you're getting like legit Bluetooth speaker performance out of it it's just you could use it like that in a pinch the translator I don't know how many people are gonna be buying this for that purpose anyway here we're gonna showcase we're gonna see if it's right or not here English to Spanish hello I'm hungry I'd like to find a restaurant most importantly I'm looking for a grilled cheese sandwich [Music] I'm hearing Spanish in my ear right now I'm breanne totake gustaría hungry you'd like it French to English just suis fatigué eh yeah I am tired so that could be cool it works is this product the future of all headphones I don't know not immediately it takes time it's expensive it's different and how many people are gonna take a chance on something that's this different you'll probably be surprised at the audio performs you'll probably be surprised at what they're capable of delivering at this form factor of course it's not all rosy this goes over the ear I'm noticing right now for example my ears they heat it up a bit because they're completely covered right when you have these on that does not happen with an earbud air pod and so forth from non sample I think it will find an audience but it's gonna take time to replace the more standard headphone earbud models from a charging perspective that is crazy simple as far as we're concerned you're not fiddling around with any connectors which can be a headache it feels futuristic because of all the magnets in play and the smoothness of it it'll go on there either way there's some cool people at this company even if it's just from a design perspective it's a lot of thought that has to go into a product like this a lot of drawings I mean I appreciate the work for a form factor that's so unusual and I have to say of course it's only been one session at this point but I'm impressed so far this is a cool thing so my dog Otis just had puppies and I want to show you guys how cute they are so I'm making a website to

another video and today we're gonna take a look at my top 10 truly wireless earphones now all of these you could get from Amazon I'll throw the links up in the description the prices range from 70 to 180 bucks so everything that you're gonna see in this video less than 200 bucks now on the side note these aren't the top 10 earphones on the planet these are just the top 10 that I have now other companies make these like JBL I'll check Lanson be an oh and a few other ones if you don't see the ones that you had your eye on in this video hit me up in the comments and we'll check those out later now there's two sets of earphones that you're not gonna see in this video number one the braggy - now as much as I like these there's one thing about them that I don't like and that's the price for the originals you're still looking at 250 bucks and for the braggy - Pro you're looking at 300 bucks now in this day and age that price is to get damn high now if it was a couple of years ago I wouldn't be complaining because you only had two choices you had the original samsung icons and you had the braggy - and both of them was over 200 bucks it is what it is fast-forward to today pretty much every company makes a set and they all range between 100 and 200 bucks suspended more than 200 that's a note for me dog and the second set that you're not gonna see in this video are these the Qi C's and everything that looks like these you've seen these on Amazon a dime a dozen I think I paid 30 bucks for these don't wish them money the sound quality is trash and the Bluetooth connectivity is garbage I all these $30 ones pass on alright so let's get right into it now I'm gonna start off with the most requested ones on my channel now there's no particular order I'm just a matter of fact let me tell you what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna go through all the ones that I have and then I'll rank them on sound quality feel and look but once I show you them we just talk about the price the battery the battery case will let you know whether they're waterproof or not and any standout features we're not gonna do a full review on each alright so let's start off with the infamous Apple earpods and he's gonna run your 50 bucks battery life five hours with the case 24 hours so five hours with the music Tom put them in the case you can rock them up to 24 hours they do feature fast charge 15 minutes will give you three hours worth of music and you also got the w1 chip so if you got an iPhone it's gonna connect to your phone effortlessly effortlessly I do not what I'm trying to say I so here we go Apple earpods now this is actually my third set of these I got a love-hate relationship with these I actually like how they sound I like how they feel but I can't stand how they look to me these look so  silly what we're gonna go into silly what we're gonna go into this with an open mind here we go Apple earpods now just put them back in the box for dramatic effect but I've been using these all weekend here's the battery case now one thing I will say they do look nice and sleek okay here's your earphones now ya hear me say headphones y'all know what I'm talking about headphones earphones same I calm down this is what they look like I just can't stand this look any time I see somebody rocking these I just kind of laugh inside but then I do where to myself and I look like a douche but it is what it is these headphones they sound good but as far as using these in the gym that's a no-no alright these will not stay in my ear now everybody got different ears so they might stay in yours let me show you something else real quick that I picked up for these just in case you having that same problem as me and they won't stay in your ears you're gonna want something like these now I'll leave the link for this up in the description take this out kind of look like the Avengers this is a little case alright so we got a little silicone case okay little while silicone clip so you don't lose them and check this out alright so this is why I got these little fins now you can add fins to your earbuds let's see well slap these on mattify got slapped in one a minute but you get the idea add some fins just case you want to workout with these and they'll stay in the air I saw it test those out in a second all right so this what I'm gonna do I'm gonna pause the video I'm gonna play some music I'll let you know how they sound how they look and how they feel and then we'll keep it moving talk amongst yourselves alright so here we go sound quality crystal clear nice and loud I definitely like them but not the most bass in the world as far as the feel lightweight super comfortable you can easily wear these all day and for the look this is what they're gonna look like when you're wearing them pretty  silly but some people like them silly but some people like them some people don't these really ain't my cup of tea now what I use these for the most is talking on the phone and if you talk on the phone a lot you're gonna like these because like I said once you're wearing them you forget that you have them on they're so lightweight and comfortable by the wings if you want to wear them to the gym now on the side note these ones in that little package check this out you just slide these on just like this and now you can rock these around your neck pretty cool alright so at the end of the video I'll let you know where these rank from 1 to 10 let's keep it moving alright so next up let's get into the Jabra elite 65 t now he's gonna run you 120 bucks the battery life is 5 hours with the case 15 hours the dust and water resistant and Alexa voice enabled now I never heard these so let's check these out together anything else for microphones for enhanced sound customize your music proven wireless connection up to 5 hours battery 15 with the charging case two-year dust and water resistant warranty voices system enabled alright so here we go do I need a little unboxing knife let me grab something real quick shout out to the Spider Man alright peace Stanley here we go Rock one more wrap ok here we go okay Jabra elite 65 t welcome to superior sound okay so this is gonna be your charging case let me not break this okay I'll figure that out in a second I was about to reach let's see different size earbuds micro USB charging cable use your books and plug them in follow and here's our actual earbuds any day now alright here we go okay lightweight nice and small let's see if we can open this case up real quick without breaking it alright this case is really trolling me right now and I'm about to rage alright so the first time you open the case it's gonna take a little bit of pressure then it just pops right open alright so let's see how these look in the charging case let's see line up these magnets that's one and here's the other one so it's going to look like this little green LED pop them open like that alright so let me test these out and see how they sail alright so I just tried these out and I got to keep a real job these are a triple major go I am totally feeling these now as far as the sound quality nice and loud crystal clear and a lot of bass check this out now they do have an app so from the app you can activate here through that's what the ambient sounds and you have different music presets so you got default bass boost speech treble boost smooth and energized now of course I dropped it on bass boost immediately and the sound quality is crazy these are easily blowing the air pods out the water now as far as the feel super comfortable once you put these in your ears they not coming out these will be perfect for the gym and of course the look this was going to look like when you wearing them I like that look not too big and goofy not too crazy looking not too futuristic looking nice discreet ear buds so far these might be my new favorites but these are definitely for the gym I did about 100 pushups now let me stop I did about five push-ups this is about five push-ups but I was just doing a little simulated workout these were not moving your ears but the sound quality I'm feeling these alright so let's keep it moving next up we got the Bose sound sport free now he's gonna run you 170 bucks battery life five hours with the case another 10 hours these are sweat and water resistant and you got the Bose Connect app that features find my buds so if you lose one you can use the app to locate the buds now I never heard these so let's try these out together Rock here we go now you already know if you getting both files or earphones these should be quality let's see did we miss anything no pretty much it there we go okay now I'm not gonna do a full review we're just gonna go through these quick now right out of the gate the charging case is a little bit bigger than the rest of them giggity got some LEDs let's hit that button okay now these are kind of big insert your own diggity check these out definitely a little bit on the big side but they come with the wings alright that's a nice touch let's see what else you get now of course bowls presentation top of the line usual books and plug them and file them little poison for the trolls file let - let's see microUSB charging cable you got some different wings I always big to small and that's pretty much it now for the charging case let's see yeah the charging case is a little bit on the big side what we're gonna work with that and here goes your earbuds all right so let me pair these up and we'll see how Desalle all right John still be back in now it was a little bit worried about these because the air phones are kind of big and the case is kind of big but let me tell you this the sound quality on these is almost mind-blowing alright so far these are the best the base is intense the sound is crystal-clear and these might be the loudest ones I heard yet so for sound

for the first time in this video the air pods is catching the wind because the air pods sound better now they are loud you got some bass but I'm just not blown away now as far as the way they feel a little bit cumbersome a little bit hard to get used to the way they slide in your ears not a big fan of these and as far as the look I don't like this pattern on the front here's how they're gonna look in your ears a little bit big and goofy these would be a nice gift for somebody let's drop them in the case here's one thing about the case check this out alright when you like the case in the

one of the things I like about rocking these at night when I'm riding my bike because you're gonna get those flashing LEDs more visibility these just look dope they sound dope but again the best thing about these that portable power bank and if you're looking for earbuds that's gonna last you all day long these have the longest lasting battery life of any on the market eight to 12 hours straight

review,2020-10-07 10:22:44.970123, so I made that video recently about the Apple earpods they came back into my life I've been using the air pods and kind of enjoying it they're wildly successful you see them out in the world other manufacturers you know they're entering the space this is the latest incarnation of the fully wireless Samsung earbud product has a couple of features that haven't been seen before prime my favorite one is the fact that this entire setup can charge from any phone that supports wireless charge sharing because this is a Samsung product and this is a Samsung phone there's also some interplay there that's a bit smoother than it might otherwise be with a third-party pair of earbuds or puds but once you're into the app this is where I think they have a bit of an advantage over the air pods they're super configurable here we can see the battery life of each individual units you can use one independently of the other you can keep one of these guys charging in the case while listening to the other one there's some different equalizer settings here for a bass boost soft dynamic clear and so on you can manage how these things deal with notifications they do have touch pads on the side unlike the air pods these have interchangeable ear tips and ear hooks as well look at all those options the air pod you've seen it before doesn't fit that far into the ear canal for some people this fits really well others it won't stay in their ears these on the other hand are gonna be a bit more predictable because they sit further in the ear canal and they have that secondary rubber plasticky component they should just be a bit more secure in there considering the way that they're designed air pod is a bit taller but also slightly less chunky than the Galaxy bud so people want to know hey which one should I get considering that you can use either on multiple platforms they do work as Bluetooth headsets you can use the air pods on Android you could use the Galaxy buds on iOS within the app there's also a find my earbuds button so that'll track these down these things could be pretty easy to lose I mean they are tiny also there's a pretty cool ambient sound option I can actually elevate the volume of ambient sound a sound around me so it'll be amplified into my ear so I can hear my surroundings while I'm listening to music podcast audiobook and so on now you can toggle that all the way down so that it's muted you know what's going on around me is muted you have ambient if you're on the bike you're cycling you need to hear if if a car honks its horn or something this can really amplify your surroundings of course it's not on the air pods there's also a voice focus feature in there so this looks for voices specifically and allows them to cut through that particular frequency range I find this to be useful from time to time now the way that the touchpad works you can tap to play or pause a track double tap to play the next track answer or end a phone call triple tap to play the previous track and touch and hold to use a user configurable users choice you could have that launched something specifically do something specifically and that's user configurable that's nice now that I have it for quick ambient sound I'm gonna touch and hold and see if I can lighten up the surroundings here we go oh wow that's cool it toggles ambient mode while you're holding your finger on the touch pad I'm in ambient right now I can totally hear my conversation hear my own voice now do I look a little strange doing this quite possibly but the question you all have is like how do they stack up against the air pods now as you guys know I'm an s10 user this is the device that's currently in my pocket so the effectiveness of either of these earbuds it has to be in correlation to this particular device we talked about some advantages within the app who knows I might be willing to give up those extra features in exchange for potentially better sound I'm not really sure we'll start with the galaxy buds I want to make sure I've got maximum volume okay so now I know I've got max volume a little sample mm-hmm okay now we're in soft right now dynamic clear bass hmm [Music] okay I'm wondering right now if the people that have tested these already had them in full volume or not cuz I read some of those things that you read and that was the experience I was having until I made sure the buds themselves were max volume and the phone was max volume now there's a lot more thump way more bass our people doing it wrong [Music] it's a headphone I'm hearing instruments I was gone for a minute did you trick sort of I've heard better kind of feel like I got to do this exact same track right now on the air pods like right now without further ado hurry up hurry up hurry up way less isolation I hear the the fan on the camera here we go beginning you know neither are blowing my brains out you know obviously I've tried some very expensive headphones in this spot in this seat right here we've done it together you and I Jack Kirk and whoever else happens to be behind me on any given day these are tiny dental floss situations look at them in terms of sound I think I can say based on that quick little test right there the buds there's a bit more thump to it maybe my expectations were too high either probably closer to this performance then they are to like a full-on pair of headphone performance that said the most striking difference for me between the two is the fit and the feel right in the sound seal when you put these on you feel isolated but there's a drawback to that I noticed they're in my ears a little bit more this I don't even feel it this is a kind of a tighter feel if I had to choose this is a bit more comfortable for my particular ear canal and that's part of the reason I think I keep reaching for the air pods in the first place not because they sound the best but because you just don't even notice you're wearing them that could be a good thing or a bad thing neither are going to be an amazing audio experience but really these products are about convenience so evaluating them on convenience you have to give certain points to the new Samsung product because of the fact that it can charge wirelessly and off of the phone itself also the app gives you more configurability also another thing worth noting the galaxy buds are a bit cheaper than the air pods though that's not much of a surprise that is a hard pick I really don't know I mean it might be so simple as if you're on on samsung or on Android you might go for these and if you're on iOS you'll probably go for these just for the easier pairing across devices oh it's a hard decision I'd say if I'm about to do some kind of physical activity if I'm going for a jog or something I don't jog but like let's say I did I will probably reach for these ones it's just a bit more confidence in the fit but if it's just if it's in an environment like around the house I she really liked the idea of not feeling the thing in your ear as stupid as that looks you forget that it's there I already have so many great sounding headphones if I want to get down to business with music I think I'll probably still reach for these more because of that factor and then also keep by Sony headphones the dedicated over ear headphones with the noise cancellation everything else keep those for the discerning listening but if I didn't have those other headphones and I needed something that could isolate better than the air pods and I can only have one pair I only had 130 bucks for one pair I probably go for these it's only a one pair of headphones I probably would choose these over these but in conjunction with a really nice pair that you use sometimes this is the I don't even notice I'm wearing them headset that's the bottom line [Music]

When I was a kid, my nickname was actually a very good small tote Beans Now let us return to the discussion section Say hello to Beans and see how many comments you can get below Hi (in German), Beans Then there is a charging cable, you may need it Except for Iphone, I like to use it on airplanes Of course you know that the service system on the plane cannot use Bluetooth You can use the cable to connect your phone Don’t bring any very cheap earphones on the plane because they will interfere with the signal It’s not bad to buy a medium size In any case, I still have to maintain the title of the strongest out of the box in my world The factory smell is more than average, look at the words in rose gold and rose gold This streamlined headset is very popular now Support wireless connection, you can also adjust your headset according to the size of your head 😯 Oh See here there is a play button, this hole is when you use the cable to connect This one is smaller than my girlfriend's There is a Micro USB for charging, and there is a row of lights to show your battery level Let me show you my headset is now fully charged, and then this guy starts to shine Assuming it is ready to pair with the phone, so look here Wow, my goodness, I didn’t do anything at all, I just unlocked and automatically connected After using the fingerprint to unlock, it will jump out of the battery capacity full charge I'm connected Here is a little common sense, when you are using the same icloud account is All your Apple products will automatically connect to the headset It's like a laptop, iPad, Apple Watch, just like your happy family👪👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👪 Let's test how his voice is, do we have music listening software here? Come on Lew, come see you together, and see that my robocop is still here (I don’t know how to translate this passage) I have already told you that Total Recall Terminator, Bloodsport, Van Damme are on the same day (I don’t know how to translate this passage) DAHH! I need to tell you something about beats Super popular, then you let us people on the Internet, we all like: There is another kind of earphone in this world. The one you have never heard before is Senheiser, which is very good value for money And various other German names? Hahaha The technical staff had to calm down a little bit Because what you are doing is you put yourself in a silo and you are Isolate yourself from the rest of the world The rest of the world is as complicated as the rest of life Marketing that feels like reality has some such recognition Whole package Don't go to the woman holding the Gucci bag and snatch it away: ''You should bring an eco-friendly bag"" This is a package transaction, in fact you are only paying for the headset advertising They give a lot of money for celebrities to wear and show up in front of the flashlight so that you have that kind of celebrity’s idea that you can buy it, just like LEBRON JAMES Just bring the earphones for a whole year and you pay him for the whole year This is very important, it will affect my feeling, maybe my coffee is extra strengthen OKAY! I think this product, the Beats brand is not as good as people think It’s not like people think if you know what I’m talking about So bad emphasis is on the low end. They are expensive, I will agree with you The ease of connection will make sense to people Valuable to people, they are the one harassing the person wearing rose gold Enjoy yourself like you can get lost in his role Rose Gold Solo Translation: Xueyu Malaysia Okay, please don't disturb me getting along with the headphone adults"

The Bose QC35 and now QC35 II are widely regarded as the benchmark for wireless noise cancelling headphones. The new Sony WH1000XM3 headphones are looking to change that. So the question is... Has Sony done enough to dethrone Bose? Which is the best pair of wireless noise cancelling headphones for 2018, 2019 and beyond?

headphones|iphone|sony vs bose,2020-10-07 10:22:44.970252, it's time for a little bit of a showdown what's happening in noise canceling wireless noise canceling that's that's what people are upgrading to this what humans want to know about block out the ambience you could sewn-in you could do your stuff these two guys right here then the conversation was centered around these two models and so I thought man these are the ones that have to go head to head right now the WH 1000x m3 and we also have the quiet comfort 35 to when it comes to noise cancelling most people's first experience with it is likely through a Bose QuietComfort product but sony has a legit challenger here in the form of the m3 I have to get to the bottom of this rated at 30 hours of battery life with noise cancelling turned on compared to 20 on the Bose product that said the Bose product is a bit lighter they quit charge now which is one of the reasons to upgrade if you have an old set so in the case of the Sony here you can turn a 10 minute charge into five hours of listening time that was one of the major drawbacks to wireless headphones in the past less so now with these really short charge times and they also support voice assistance Google assistant is built-in to both of them will can I get a price update this should be close the QC 35 s right now through the link down below they're probably 300 bucks while you're watching this the m3 is on the other hand are a little bit more expensive around 350 some paperwork and then everything else is in this carrying case user manual up top get the app turn on your headphones and everything else is in this carrying case holy smokes the travel size is actually quite similar a mesh and threaded kind of design this one is like a faux leather and then a medial Prine pocket so like they're really and then a loop here and a loop here they go on head to head ladies and gentlemen padded Alcantara headband little pouch on this side there is a cable included as well both of these headphones can work in a wired fashion 2.5 millimeters on the part that connects to the headphone three point five millimeters on a part that connects to the audio source so type C is available on the Sony's but it's micro USB with quick charge on the Bose interesting the thing you're going to notice about the Bose there are tactile buttons physical buttons volume up and down a dedicated assistant button they're using a new more robust material apparently so they should hold up to wear and hair slightly better I like how this is not a button but a switch and when you turn this on it will immediately go into bluetooth pairing mode okay there's the Sony's the cable in this case a little more robust both three-point-five replacing this cable gonna be a bit easier than this one big fan of type C I'm gonna give that advantage to the Sony side the airline adapter this is a little bit uncommon these days they're usually on the plane if you need one unboxing experience and accessories may have to give it to the Sony's you know what that doesn't actually feel as heavy as I expected getting the difference in numbers on paper it still feels very lightweight you don't have a ton of buttons or switches here you can see you have the NFC logo there there's a dedicated power button but it's very similar to the ambient or noise cancelling switch though I do like having a dedicated switch this will quickly give you access to ambient noise if you mean to hear it type-c connector over here and also an LED light that's a nice little touch this is actually touch controlled volume controls play pause you can answer a phone call and you can also skip tracks forward and back you can also hold your palm over top of the ear cup which will then mute the sound of your music and allow you to hear an individual who's talking to you so you can quickly you know you walk up to the Starbucks you order a drink you quickly hold your hand over it it's nice it's better than having to take the ear cup off that is comfortable it is light without having them turned on and having the noise canceling function enabled they're still cutting out a lot of the ambient noise one thing I look for with headphones is like how much are they squeezing me in order to achieve that this is not too much of a squeeze I feel like I could wear these for hours and hours huh passively these are not blocking as much they're comfortable the head bed is slightly less wide a slight bit more pressure from it just Comfort not even listening to them I'm probably gonna give it to the Bose right now these ones come off and fold like this so when you pick them up out of the case you go like this the Sony's fold the other way like this kind of gotta fold them and then turn them see what I'm saying maybe there's a reason for that but it's worth noting turn these guys on will do the Bo's first easy setup I turn these on and ask me to pair right away drag to connect ah this is in reference to the voice assistant which it looks like is accessed via this button on the side here oh wow noise canceling full effect now okay so when you hit the button it tells you the time tells you if you have any notification it says you don't have any new notifications now if you did it would read them to you you don't have to go reach for your phone what's the population of Toronto fast they said 2.7 million you hold it and the cool thing that it does when you're talking to assistant is it lets you hear your own voice so the microphones on the outside are picking up your voice so there's a few different settings here for noise cancellation it's in the high mode right now I can't hear anything right now while I'm talking to you okay so let's go ahead and play some music now hmm Jack you know this track it's a classic look at that make some noise Curt let me see if I can hear you man that's a track though noise cancelling is just crushing right now it's destroying the world right now it's incredible Kirk was talking over there turn attract forget it I didn't hear anything it's just lips moving sound I'm not gonna talk about it yet give me a second here okay now let's get the Sony app and let's do a quick compare oh wow Google assistant figured it out right away tap to connect well done so the integration here with assistant is bananas I didn't even need to get the app I mean I will also a hundred percent battery out of the box jaci out of you a couple points give him a couple points for that alright woah Wow okay so here's their app adaptive sound control noise cancelling oh my god that is crazy okay so it gives you control over ambience based on your circumstance and they give you these images in order to distinguish like what the activity might be appearance-wise guys these these don't look as good right jack is actually giving the looks to these I thought because they were a bit bigger you might not like the look as much but you don't really notice that these two we got two votes here for these Wilkin and you saw the bows which appearance do you like better okay wow that's three votes for these on appearance the configurability is extreme I can go in here and toggle the amount of ambient sound I come here I couldn't do that over here if you're the type that likes to use these on public transit you know they announce the different stops and whatnot if you have the ambient sound control on it's blocking out some stuff but letting some stuff in oh my god the noise cancelling comes on full blast say something Kirk Oh interesting I can hear you the adaptive sound control it knows that I'm staying Wow so it knows I'm not moving right now it's got it mostly noise cancelling that's pretty smart look at this it has optimized based on little details including atmospheric pressure the sound position control what well I can change the sound stage there's a surround virtualizer there's an equalizer this is a much more comprehensive app from a personalization configuration standpoint oh baby if I just cover this ear cup it's full feed microphones through to my head oh my god and it's instant as well whoo we may have some contenders yeah I mean you listen to music yet this quiets the music but I can have a conversation and we still Phil Collins beneath it barely there and then and then it's like this he's back he's back hold on we're not we're not talking yet hold on hold on hold on all right look I mean maybe you could tell from my reaction maybe not I feel like he's a step up on a sound quality holy moley that's a crush factory right there at the base like if you want it blow your head right clean off quick point from Jack he says these are more sealed less sound bleed substantially I mean having the equalizer built-in lets you really tune the sound performance of these as well and just all the other various configurability attributes in the app for the Sony's is pretty wild pair that with the fact that the way you interact with it with a double tap or the palm over top of the ear cup to have a quick conversation the ambient mode it's a wild package a one thing I like about the Bose is the slightly smaller ear cup this is a really tough choice these do not sound bad we're talking about a marginal kind of thing going on here and you may or may not hear that as much as I do it's obvious to me that these are the better sounding headphones of the two I think the noise cancelling here performs a little bit better at maximum capacity you can't really go wrong with either of these but if I'm out there and I got 300 or 350 bucks this is where I'm going now you can let me know down in the comments which one would you take of these two if it was your choice either one of these will do but you want my pick go this way [Music]

Can the Beats by Dre Powerbeats Pro dethrone the Apple AirPods 2? AirPods have been a popular choice for fully wireless earbuds but for many they aren't secure enough. Powerbeats Pro aims to fix that by including a secure fit and ear hook on each earbud. Powerbeats Pro appear to be targeted at the fitness market featuring water and sweat resistance. So which will it be for you, Powerbeats Pro vs Apple AirPods 2?

airpods,2020-10-07 10:22:44.970276, powerbeats Pro it's a big day you know that battery life sports LeBron James are you gonna recommend these over air pods are these better than air pods yes or no what yeah all right it's been a long time actually since I looked at a pair of beats this is the latest from the beats brand of course now in the Apple family and because it had some benefits to this particular product it actually behaves a lot like ear pods I do have some air pods here these are the black ones from a recent video these are done up by color where no you can't get them in black but it kind of makes sense for this comparison since the power beats Pro are in black these are gonna be a little bit more expensive than Apple's air pods and they have a slightly different design I think this will be popular for athletes people who want to have the ear hook on there have a bit more of a secure fit battery up to nine hours of Wireless play 24 hours with the charging case sweat and water-resistant adjustable secure fit and on ear controls one thing I like before I even pop this open they put the controls on both earbuds so you can trigger play pause from either side whichever is right for you so you don't need to remember was that button on the left or on the right now of course with the Beats products pretty much all of them the expectation is kind of premium price point like it's 250 bucks so keep that in mind the case is bigger it's quite a bit bigger than air pods it's way bigger it's like six of these air pots five maybe you pull out the earbud it fits over the ear like this and you have interchangeable ear tips as well this has become the standard for athletic style earphones and for good reason you want something lightweight you want something secure and you don't want something huge and you want something sweat resistant well this has all those components and attributes so I think eventually you're gonna see a lot of these things at the gym you're gonna see a lot of these things on the basketball court this is the wireless charge case there's two contact points on the inside there's also a button on the inside yes it's a pairing button of course if you have an iPhone when you pop this open it's gonna it's gonna register to pair immediately or at least is gonna ask you to register to pair because this product is using the h1 chip so to pair it you're just gonna pop this open don't remove the earbuds and then it'll prompt you on your device if you do have an Android device these will work as well you're just gonna need to press and hold the pairing button and then pair it like you would any other Bluetooth device so yes even though beads is part of the Apple brand this will work with Android devices and various other Bluetooth devices now the port on the back it's not USB type-c so staying true to the Apple branding like the air pods this is actually a lightning connector a black USB cable to charge it up a lightning connector there so kind of unfortunate if you have a lot of USB type-c components this has I phone users first their front of mine and it makes sense because these power beats Pro they're gonna be sold in Apple stores are gonna be they're gonna move a lot of Units on Apple's website so they're gonna take care of iPhone users first five minute charge equals 1.5 hours of play here's a different ear tip options this is important especially for $250 pair of headphones you kind of have to have this you should have this it's gonna be in the ear canal it's gonna fit a bit deeper than the then the air pod does usually what that means is you you're gonna have better bass reproduction because you get a better seal in the ear canal that you just can't achieve with the air pod but it will also mean that you know putting this thing on and taking it off it's a bit more of a headache it's not quite as smooth so just keep that in mind as well but that looks like the standard medium connector they've also included this two-stage adapter if you look at that just before I try these things out I think it's kind of important to address the size I think some people are gonna think that's a big container so air pods tiny little dental floss situation that is obviously it's nothing you don't even notice it it's got a barely there kind of situation if you try to do that with the power beats the latest power beats Pro what's gonna happen I mean you're gonna see it but it's doable it's not terrible actually it's heavier you're not gonna want it there all day headphones over here phone ready to go it open and look at this this is really the benefit of this cohesiveness if you're an iPhone user you're really gonna appreciate this and how's the install let's go ahead and try oh I got a little audio tone played in the ear that's the install I mean obviously it feels super secure so in this case play pause is the beats logo button right here it's a physical button it's not a tap it's not capacitive I like the idea of a physical button saying goes for volume which is on the top here hopefully Kirk can see that this is volume up and down I can tell already though before I even play music that the seal here is far more substantial in the ear canal I'm sealed off a little bit from the rest of the world so therefore that the experience is more isolating that might be what you want you want to drown out all the coffee-shop noise and/or the noise at the gym and things like this you can understand why you would want that but then there's the argument for the convenience factor of not necessarily fully closing off the whole world which is what happens with air pods that said I'm going one layer deeper here a lot of people make the argument not with those you end up having to crank them up even louder which is ends up being worse for your hearing because you're trying to drown out ambience with more volume instead of by sealing off your your ear canals and then you can feed it less volume protect your hearing a little bit better you hear me Kirk I'm gonna put hit play and then get lost for a minute here these are hip-hop headphones like that's the thing you know they really shine when you feed when you feed them some bass they want to eat some bass you hit it with some hip-hop and he's it's thumping I mean he's doing something that the air pods can't do I'd say I see less of a significant improvement with kind of classic songs where I was kind of thinking I was hoping for maybe a little bit more like where maybe there wasn't quite as much oomph but that stuff was mixed differently back then that wasn't they weren't they weren't too mixing for a subwoofer and and these things they really replicate the feeling of an actual subwoofer in like a car stereo like it thumps in your head when you feed it some hip-hop I'm sure it'd be the same for a lot of pop music modern music I think these things are really tuned for modern music based on this experience here but there's more to this package I suppose like when you think about what this thing is and who it's for like my feeling has become just just in this this short exposure to this particular earbud is it's like a package deal type of thing I get it the way that people think about beats the brand specifically it's like oh I'm gonna pay a lot of money there for that logo and yes there is definitely that you get this logo right here look at that you get to wear that around boom you're gonna pay a few dollars period that's kind of the origin story of the brand you won't put dr. Dre's name on something prior to being acquired by Apple it's gonna cost you a few bucks and that's just been the case for a while so it's never really been about the value proposition it's never really been about the best value for money it's been about a package deal of style sound primarily in the bass department and a convenience factor which in this case is obviously a step better if you happen to be on iOS and you can utilize that H chip just like you can with the air pods this is gonna be a popular headphone period I'm confident in saying it's gonna be a popular headphone there's just there's just such a huge percentage of the market that wants something just as convenient as I mean I'm just speculating right now like listen to me talking here I'm just guessing but I assumed there's a percentage of the market that wants an air pod-like experience with something that will actually stay in their ears with something that has more durability to it with something they feel like they can run around jog around bike around be more active with because there is a slight lack of confidence with the air pod even if it fits in your ear keep in mind once again I got the black air pod here color where custom air pod it just it's in there I don't feel like I'm gonna lose it but if I got bumped or you know took a I don't know if I was playing basketball I would not want to have this headphone in this on the other hand that would be I feel like I could wear this on the ice playing hockey and that would stay in not that I would do that that would be a crazy I did to try to play hockey with this on but like that's why I'm trying to get it so it's gonna have the distribution it's going to be in the Apple stores it's gonna have the advantage of the enhanced performance on the iOS side they're gonna sell a lot of them it's unfortunate it's got to be $250 but with the air pods already being as expensive as they are it's kind of like these have to be more money than that it's imperative and I guess maybe they could have been 200 but they're 250 cuz their beats let's just be honest but they're still gonna sell a bunch of them because they're gonna deliver a sound that a lot of people are looking for that they're looking for that extended low end that enhancement on the bass side and they're doing it in an overall package deal that's quite you know I'm gonna be honest that's attractive to me there's nothing weird going on even the logo itself is somewhat subdued at least on this black model you don't see it unless it hits the reflection otherwise it's a matte finish it's pretty subdued you got the different ear tips they're gonna sell a boatload of them for the average person should you spend 250 you could find a better value out there but I know based on the experience I've had with the with the air pods themselves there is something to be said there is a value associated with the ease of use and integration on the iOS side like that there's an extended benefit there that's hard to put a price on specifically so from that standpoint it's like where else are you going to get this pack where else are you going to get in h1 chip experience with this kind of battery life with this kind of profile in something that isn't the air pods that's a step better than the air pods like no offense to the air pods but they leave you wishing for a little bit more in a sound Department what would I mean no offense to the air bus do the air pods have feelings no they don't have feelings I said in a previous video when I did the video on the air pods I'm a guy I'm into headphones I got very expensive headphones they're all over the place but I just don't find myself reaching for them as much because they're less convenient in some way whether they're huge or there's a cable associated they just don't go in the pocket they there's various ones that are less likely to be charged this package deal here proved to be so convenient they even though I had way better sounding headphones I found myself reaching for these and this is an extension of that this is the next step the convenience factor here it goes down a bit you get the bigger package they don't pop in on in and out of your ears quite as easily but they still have some of that origin story some of those convenient elements that come with this and for the time being that remains an exclusive item for Apple branded and of course beats branded via Apple products so that's something to keep in mind I think they're gonna sell a bunch of them if you want a slick package if you're happy with the branding if you want to rep the B on the side if you like a lot of bass you can be happy you got to pay to play in this department no jokes they don't let you in the front door without 250 to be clear you hear me Kirk 250 that's the ticket to get in the door alright front row seats Raptors in the playoffs game 6 coming soon let's go Raptors

10:22:44.970299," every so often I go on the hunt looking for value for you of course so you can get more for your money all right hard-earned dollars those are and today I feel like I hope that I've uncovered some value in the tech world this thing here the mpow sport wireless earphones these are the best-selling wireless earbuds on Amazon and they have a four star review with eleven thousand is it 11,000 reviews well 11,000 reviews holy moly I mean I haven't tried of yet but this is the best part these things are like 17 or $18 wireless fully wireless 17 or 18 dog plus IP rating waterproof for the fitness folks ipx7 waterproof rating for the fitness what 17 or 18 bucks what's going on here man people are spending hundreds of dollars on wireless earbuds do they need to be should they be I don't know I've tried them all you know I have but the thing is 100 200 $300 earbuds or headphones are not a reality for everyone and and some people might even be wasting some cash on them and not getting the cost to performance ratio they possibly could have now granted we're gonna need to approach this video with the the correct expectation right now this moment that I'm shooting is it might be different after this video goes up but these are $16.99 so we just need to keep that framework in our minds when evaluating these things they are cheap and they are fully wireless so they don't need to be as good as a $200 pair of earbuds they need to be good enough and save you a boatload of cash that's the idea that's why we're looking at this anyhow true high-definition sound and deep bass advanced noise cancellation well I'm not sure that there's actual noise cancellation happening hopefully some isolation comfort and stability design we now know where we're saving the cash for sibility made for sport built-in microphone for hands-free operation a cool and handy carry evie a box included operating range 10 meters is bluetooth for one by time 220 hours charging time 1.5 and the talk / playing time apparently seven hours now I gather that some of those eleven thousand individuals who decided to review these things have had that criteria at least somewhat met so they're not just making stuff up and throwing it on the back that's my guess at least anyhow let's crack this open and see what we're working with it's amazing can you imagine fully wireless earbuds $16.99 what's going on here okay travel case included a little bit of paperwork and that's that all right everything is in here oh all right presentation it's okay so far a flat cable that goes behind your head we have some ear loops which are kind of important for you know the fitness types runners and so on you might like this style this is kind of flexible and hopefully it's going to stay on a little bit better with that extra added ear loop around the outside of the ear now it does have interchangeable ear tips they've included a bunch in here ohm comply style ear tips and then we have three sizes of your typical ear tips small medium and large and lastly a microUSB cable to charge them up pretty self-explanatory and of course the case to keep it all in when you're not using it now the earbuds fit in like that like this we'll go behind here and then this will go in like this I don't know if Kirk can see that there now I guess the medium is pre-installed that's actually the medium already feels these are comfortable that's a comfortable earbud right now it's got decent sound isolation with the medium tip on it and then you get the the added security of having the hook over the ear so I could be that could be at the basketball court you know I could be I could be you know Steph Curry need to pop a shot Steph Curry downstairs and stay mobile with no issue no in all seriousness these are these are on their in their and they're on you see what I mean more comfortable than I expect it okay now on the earbuds there's a little door here a little rubber door that covers up the charge port it also has volume controls somehow so yeah they fit volume up and down on there as well so you can quickly adjust the volume oh and this button actually clicks this big see that so that's your play pause and answering phone calls and probably your power switch as well I'm guessing let's see if these have any power okay they do I got power on right now your headset is connected okay let's go ahead here and a couple tunes honestly like okay here's the thing ladies and gentlemen every so often you figure something out you find something like this for the money that is just like such an easy thing to recommend these do they sound good they sound better than I expected the sound I I think the Internet in this case might be right with those 11,000 reviews I don't expect them to be like crazy battery performers or anything like that but this package like with the comfort and the sound and the price it's a bit ridiculous if I'm being honest it's like one of the best purchases in tech right now 1699 what do you got you got wired earbuds I don't know what's your Excuse like you don't want to spend a 17 you spent 17 on lunch this is a Wednesday afternoon this is a Taco Tuesday this is a champagne breakfast this is some bacon and eggs you know this is some real maple syrup because we'll trying to make the argument on Aunt Jemima and I just I'm sorry you know that's just not where we're coming from on that we're talking about Quebec we're talking about Ontario we're talking about maple trees that's what we're talking about for $16.99 guys it's like now I realize there's a job to be done here I need to be investigating this stuff I need to be out there on the internet uncovering finding the deals that are worth paying attention to and evaluating those you're not gonna get a big brand name in fact you're gonna get something quite the opposite your headphones are gonna be called em pal so you gotta be comfy with that you might even want to own that on another level and be like look Lou told me about the N pal I don't even care like what you got beats okay fine 1699 yo you just wasted a party and a parka and some ping pong and a pizza and some popcorn and I got all those things and my tunes so maybe it's gonna be em pal for me the wireless earbuds that probably most people should own and most people are probably spending too much on these things to be honest myself included most of us need to be a little more kids because you take a peek around and there's some stuff out there you could save some cash and get some decent performance and if somebody tries to make fun of you you know I mean somebody at school you're in high school they like wet it what's these empowers you'd be like okay keep chatting go watch Luke they'll let you know it's all good it's fine you're in great shape you're better off check the reviews it's not just me it's the mpow flame seems like the real deal 1699 cheeseburger fries ice cream"

they have a mic the audio is paired if you long hold the side panel it activates whatever voice assistant you have Microsoft prefers Cortana you can get Cortana for Android or iOS if you want but I never really worried about that it works perfectly fine with Google assistant and it works with Siri it's kind of like a cherry on top so these are my new go-to flight headphones and just casual listening headphones they're not the best audio fidelity in the world I mean they're Wireless first of all and then they're a little weaker in the mids and the highs than the Bose word but just as far as bluetooth streaming over Spotify these are more than fine they sound pretty good and they're just that much more comfortable okay so that brings us to these over here these are the audio technica ath m50 bt bluetooth so they made a wireless version finally of the famous M 50s that I've been a fan of for years and it's exactly what it sounds like it's literally a pair of M 50s with the wire snipped nothing too crazy or extra they charge via micro USB they have a play/pause and media controls on the side and you can still plug them in if you want to and use them on a desktop overall this is really just a revival of a classic for the 2018 situation we find ourselves the comfort is the same the build and materials are the same they're just still super flexible and adjustable and the sound signature is the same which is what I loved about these there is no noise cancellation but the passive noise isolation from the pads is pretty great so this is an awesome pair of casual listening headphones as the previous and 50s were but now they're wireless for your phone especially if you don't need noise cancellation plus these are way cheaper so I'll leave a link to all the stuff talking about down below now of course with all of that there is fitness and working out I still kind of consider these all a little too nice to wear while working out plus I don't want to like have them fall off and break so I still stick with wireless earbuds for working out so you might expect me to go directly to the j-bird run four wireless earbuds but they're still not quite exactly what I prefer they are pretty great for their first pair of truly wireless earbuds as they've done before they sound amazing but in your ears there's still a little bit clunky and a little bit heavy mostly thanks to the batteries so if we're working out and moving around and things like that I still prefer the earbuds that have the wire connecting them in the back it doesn't bother me there's still Wireless to my phone and I just feel like they lock in my ear better they're more comfortable so I still like these jaybird x3 has actually been my go-to for a while I have multiple pairs they sound great still they're super lightweight they stay in my ears the battery lasts forever for these tiny little earbuds like eight hours straight there is matte black or matte red or whatever color you're into and they are less expensive than the fully wireless versions so can't really ask for much more than that the j-bert x4 has come out since then they are a bit more rugged and a bit more modern but there's still not USBC in fact I actually find them harder to charge so I haven't felt the need to upgrade yet maybe there will be a u.s. PC version coming soon anyway that's pretty much where we're at so far for wireless headphones at least for me on I phone believe it or not air pods are still sort of the go-to as far as portability and convenience we've had them in matte black in our store wink wink but these these are easily some of those popular headphones or earbuds now for iPhone that have ever existed now there are also rumors of air pods to like starting to pop up I'm not sure how credible those they seem pretty early and I'm also not sure what would be different about air pods - maybe wireless charging but I'll keep an eye on that and also I gotta mention I've heard a lot about these sony 1000 XM 3 i think is what they're called they're again the same price as the bows and the surface headphones i haven't tried them yet but a lot of people seem to like them so I may end up checking those out too but so far this is what I found I like ok that's pretty much it alright as a prize for making it to the end of the video I have a little bit of a an extra for you we have a couple extra of the audio technica ath m50 BTW you get the little early heads up that these will be in a giveaway some will be on instagram some will be on twitter so make sure you're following in these two places over the next week to get all the info for those when they come out that's pretty much it have a happy holiday thanks again for watching I'll see you guys in the next one peace

We have another episode from the series ""Does It Suck?"" It's one of my favorite things here at Unbox Therapy, look at relatively cheap things which you would not expect to be good, and perhaps find some jewelry. Photive PH-BHT3 Bluetooth Wireless Headphones. I've been looking at these headphones for a long time. These are wireless bluetooth headphones for about 1000 CZK. I'm a big fan of bluetooth headphones when I travel. Convenience of bluetooth, don't have that cable. And believe it or not, today you can get quite a decent sound even from Bluetooth headphones. I have been using various types of SONY Bluetooth headphones for some time. But they are expensive! So maybe, just maybe, ... ..we found something that fits your lifestyle, and also to the limits of your bank account. It can be a treasure, it can be a needle in a haystack. I mean Amazon, with millions of headphones on it. Needle ... These are just Bluetooth headsets. Let's take a look inside and see! Which is the whole point of this damn show. Slim, compact shape. Equipped with Bluetooth. Two forty millimeter converters! These are pretty big headphones on your head. Fifteen hours of play with just three hours of charging. Let's get to these pets. Well so .. It looks like we have a thousand crowns experience with unpacking. No, it's coming. Packaging! Protective packaging. A little silicon in the bag. ""Activated carbon, don't eat."" Jack, have you had lunch yet? &gt;&gt; Jack: No. So here you go. Nice protective cover, it says Photive. Not bad, for 1000 CZK. Here are the headphones. A little paperwork .. A small pocket for your cables and such. It charges via micro USB. Yeah! Micro USB cable is included. There is also a traditional audio cable. Mini-jack, 3.5 millimeters. Let's say you're on a plane ... And you want to listen from the multimedia center inside the plane. But unfortunately, it does not support bluetooth. So you have a cable. We'll see if these headphones have any energy ... My interim response ... You know what? They look quite decent. Actually a lot like my SONY. The earbuds rotate. There are buttons. Separate volume control here, switch. Here's a place to charge, there's a small cap. Or for your separate headphone cable when you're not using Bluetooth. It looks like a microphone for phone calls. Start, pause, forward backward. To switch songs while listening to music. Let me try them. Hmmm. I don't know, medium? ..I guess it's medium size. But comfortable! Lightweight. I'm a big fan of light headphones. So the bridge over the head is metal. Let's see if they have any energy. AND! I suspect I heard a beep. Oh yeah! Look! So they flash blue and red. Which I assume means they are ready for pairing. Here we have them! BTH3 headphones. Paired! For calling and media sound. How simple can it be? Time to listen to some music. Volume for days! Probably in the danger zone. Wow! 1000CZK? Bluetooth? You are honest! You are - you -.... Now I understand why they are so well rated on Amazon. I don't know man, they are really comparable to my SONY. Should I go for SONY? Jack? &gt;&gt; Jack: Sure. Okay, give me a second. They are very comparable to these. But these are for 3500, - The layout of the buttons is actually almost identical. I'll try the same song. Let's find out. SONY sounds a little better, a little more readable. And I would also say that they are much more comfortable. A little lighter. But these are the real heroes in this video, because they are not even in the same price range. Like, it's hard to get a good pair of wired headphones for 1000 CZK. And these are bluetooth and have great sound at 1000, -. They have a great sound. Sounds better than I expected. And the processing is also better than I would expect. Okay, another episode of ""Does It Suck?"" And another surprised version of Lew. Right in front of you. For you, for your relatives, pro ... the girl you like. Bluetooth headphones Bluetooth headphones for everyone! Many thanks for watching! Give me a thumbs up below if you value the content. And I'll catch you again soon, as usual... in the next episode. Later, guys. Bluetooth !?"

up guys I'm Q PhD here and I'm in Seattle right now for a top-secret project that you guys will see soon but over the past couple days and for my trip to get here and so on I've been testing a certain pair of new headphones so you guys may have seen the pictures you may have seen the tweets it is already my new all-time favorite pair of wireless noise cancelling cans this is over the bose QC 35 2 s this is over the Microsoft Surface headphones it's the Sony WH 1000 X and threes terrible name but these are the real deal honestly there's really not all that much you have to do to really nail a pair of this category of over ear noise cancelling headphones so you've got to sound great you have to have good noise cancellation and then you just have to be somewhat comfortable and have a fairly good feature set and as you might imagine since I'm talking about him like this these male all of those so right off the bat with the sound these sound excellent they're full rich and clear with the sound they have more range and more deep bass than the Bose but without being overwhelming and short of studio headphones this is a great sounding crisp clean pair of drivers and the noise cancellation is actually a bit better than the Bose I was already sacrificing a little bit when I switched to surface headphones I think those surface headphones had slightly worse sound and slightly worse active noise cancellation but I loved the design and the comfort and USB type-c and the dials and all of that so that put them over the top for me these Sony's though sound better than both are better at noise cancellation than both and they have a great design basically as soon as I heard these I knew I liked them and they've been sort of growing on me ever since and also I wore these for five and a half hours straight on the flight to get here and they only really started to get tight by the end of those five and a half hours so design wise I think these are kind of great and that's something Bose has always been king at these are lightweight like those the cups have a good amount of padding the top band is padded there are plenty flexible enough to not be squeezing your head all the time and getting uncomfortable and then they beat the bows by being USB type-c it's actually funny a lot of people see these and immediately think this this copper accent at the top and it looks like the USBC port but it's not that's actually the microphone at the top of both ear cups the USBC port is down here at the bottom but yeah you can use the same charger as you already have for your phone or your laptop or whatever other USB see things you have and the battery life lives up to the 20 plus hours longer than the surface headphones it's great okay I'm really raving about these I'm making them sound pretty perfect trust me though they're not perfect nothing's perfect I think in an ideal world I would combine these with the surface headphones and their their dials and their design I think those those function a little bit better but here are some things about these that aren't quite perfect first of all my number one complaint is the controls there are only two physical buttons on these all the rest of the controls all the rest of the work is all done by swiping and tapping on the right ear cup which is a small touchpad so double tap to play and pause swiping up and down to change the volume and forward and backward to change tracks it can be a bit fidgety it doesn't work every time but you kind of get used to it another thing is when you take the headphones off they just keep playing like normal headphones but the surface headphones would detect when you took them off your head and they'd pause and when you put them back on they would keep playing again these don't and I kind of miss that and then the two buttons that are physical on these are the power button and the noise cancellation / ambient mode switch which by default doubles as the Google assistant button so you can hold it to speak and talk to Google assistant which is cool without ever you know taking your phone out your pocket you can ask Google assistant a question out loud and it'll answer that question it can also read your notifications when you ask it to but even with all of that I still prefer the surface headphones physical dials still for volume and then there is also what is known as the cold weather issue with these headphones there been a couple reports about it or articles about it but basically when you take these out in you know freezing conditions or sub-zero weather apparently the touch pads will start to register phantom touches so without you ever touching them it'll start to play and pause your muse and change the volume and the tracks and randomly stop playing that's pretty rough now I have been using these outside you know as low as 40 degrees Fahrenheit so not below freezing but I haven't had this issue yet to with as cold as it is in some parts of the world right now it's worth noting that these do seem to have that issue and I don't know if it can be fixed with a software update it may be possible but as of right now if there's a cold weather issue that makes these unusable in certain climates that's kind of a bummer so I have to let you guys know about it also these headphones come with a good hard case like most other over your headphones but I find that the way they fold is really annoying maybe it's just that I haven't gotten used to it yet but that's a small nitpick honestly the case itself is fine and if wind or anything blows hard enough down on you from above the mics on the top will pick that up and you'll hear it as a sort of a fuzzy static I only notice this because when I'm on the airplane which is where a lot of people will listen to these I had the vents above me and they were blowing down like directly into those microphones so you just kind of adjust that anger fine oh and the left ear cup has an NFC logo on it that can be used to tap to pair on the side of the headphones with an NFC naval device so that's pretty cool I'm gonna start using that more often to connect or to disconnect but these headphones only pair to one device at a time and that might not sound like a big deal but when you get used to headphones with multiple device connectivity and seamless switching that is a big time convenience with these surface headphones or any other pair of headphones that supports multiple devices you can be playing something like literally music from your phone on the headphones pull out your iPad which is already paired to the headphones and hit play on some video or Netflix or whatever you're doing and it'll instantly take over on the headphones and there's seamless switching back and forth between devices without dealing with the frustration of Bluetooth with these you still have to deal with the pain of Bluetooth sometimes being kind of fidgety and not connecting on the first try and having to do it again and the whole pairing process is kind of annoying so yeah just I hope the next version of these that they make the m4s have that multiple device connectivity but these don't I wish they did I really missed that but other than that I I love these headphones they're matte black mostly all the way around which you know I love but you also got this little copper accent at the top with the sony logo and the microphones and it's also on the zipper of the hard case so how they look is great how they sound is great how they feel is great they're ideal for flying of course and they're also the go to pick for just travel headphones in general and and they're just great for cancelling out the noise of an office or a coffee shop or really anywhere that noise canceling headphones are good so yeah that's that's pretty much all there is to say about headphones I'm just glad these ended up on my radar so shout out to those of you who are leaving comments on the videos shoutout to vipre for yelling at me on his livestream to go buy these shout out to everyone in the comment section of my last headphones video that got me to actually pick these up and i'm glad i'm using them now these are now permanent backpack material so i'll drop a link below if you guys want to check these out for yourself I'll leave a link to the other headphone video but that's basically it thanks for watching I'm gonna go back to working on that secret project now catch you guys in the next one peace

1000xm3,2020-10-07 10:22:44.970438, Bo's is back I don't know maybe it's possible noise cancelling headphones 700 can't say I love the name who cares about the need when they're on your head you don't care about the name anymore you wear them Bose is like look we're getting beat up out there we were on airplanes everybody had the QC series on their heads okay with a champs standing around flexing their muscles we don't have to change very much QC everybody knows they're everywhere the previous generation of these headphones and then up until I guess a year ago or whenever those Sony headphones dropped with the crazy model name XM 3 1000 wh blah blah blah and guys like me and others on youtube start talking about those ones saying hey man there's there's some updated features here plus these sound good plus Sony caught up on the noise canceling Tech and all son Bose had to do some and this is the answer this is where the 700 comes in this is the answer to all those videos all those comments and in particular that Sony product that's my feeling on the matter no I'm not it's not an official line from Bose I'm just saying that product is in this product's crosshairs premium sound world class adjustable noise cancelling industry leading voice pick up your choice of voice assistant intuitive touch control on ear cup this elite product had that they did say choose your own voice assistant so it appears you can use this either with Google assistant or Alexa unboxing experience looking kind of nice so far you see this Jack look at that frustration-free no knife necessary I appreciate that guy opening I'm into the package right now you see all right different material a faux leather type of feel silica gel haven't seen in a while I almost hit the lens unzips like almost all the way around it also comes in black if you want the more executive look it has a futuristic look to it wow those are nice-looking right away I'm gonna say I prefer the appearance to the Sony headphones look at that it's almost it's weird to see but rather than the headband itself making the adjustment the adjustment happens inside the ear cup and then this pivots so it's actually got multiple accesses to work with from spin way and then the angle with which it fits on your head depending on your your setup your skull set up finally we have Type C charging still has an analog connector now unfortunately I don't they call it 2.5 millimeter but come on like if we're gonna do this let's do the 3.5 I'm so nervous about that connector that's a bit scary how small that is is it a big deal probably not for most people I mean once it's in there it's actually quite secure and it's gonna be 3.5 on the other side obviously to connect with your analog sources also in the package type C cable I like how two cables are the same color as the headphone also this is genius right here your cables fit in and then this guy is magnetic this is a perfect little cubby now this bit of paperwork right here indicates that the whole thing is a touch pad now let's go ahead and power it up the headband it kind of seems like the headphone was designed around the headband this is all like a really soft touch material like a like a silicone something like that these are crazy comfortable they're light the noise cancelling is already on ok searching nearby we're in the app right now it sees the headphones straight away we're gonna add the product so weirdly enough is that on disconnect it now maybe I have to finish the set of gear huh no when you turn it on it tells you how much time is left on the battery not the percentage that's 6 hours and 13 minutes or something no know exactly what's going on here in the app because it says I'm connected to it but I'm showing connected to it right now but the app is not adding it all right so I feel the need to kind of mention just what went on I was just setting these up I had a 1 + 7 Pro over here and it just refused to connect in a fashion like image in a way that I would have expected so through the Bose music app which appears to be somewhat busted at the moment I couldn't get it to recognize the headset itself tried a number of different things restarting the app the phone disconnecting forgetting the Bluetooth device weirdly enough the headset connects and allows you to listen to music but you're kind of missing some of the features or at least the UI associated with the app which is part of the that's the way you want to interact with a headset like this that has the ability and the configurability ultimately for the noise canceling in the various attributes and so forth so pulled out an iPhone and an app on an iPhone was also a bit buggy but after a couple of restarts I was finally able to get it to pop up in its proper fashion so I think there's some software work that needs to be done on boses end but for the purpose of this video I'm just gonna use the iPhone because it appears to be working here but that's kind of I mean it's gonna be a lot of upset people will do was just looking it up because we're like wait are we doing something wrong and he found what 13 pages but people that have had similar issues so I'm not saying it's gonna permanently be like that they're definitely seeing those pages and hopefully they update it but and the headphones still work if you connect them just like any other Bluetooth device without the app but I don't think you want to use them that way so I think they're gonna address it I think they'll fix it but anyway this is what the app looks like as you can see it represents your headset I like that it's the actual color of my headset as well I like the fact that it represents the battery life in ours it tells you that when you first turn them on as well you have some other settings here for Bluetooth and the amount of noise canceling which I actually kind of like the simplicity of this implementation on the Sony product based on the audio input through the microphone array it can guess what the situation is and try to adjust from there this one is a little bit more simple where it's just gonna tell you okay you're at a level seven right now let's see what's in the settings here settings you can set up your product name okay so you can have three sets of favorites for noise canceling and toggle between them I'm assuming using the hardware button on the well headphones alright so I'm gonna start at zero and then slowly toggle up the noise canceling to see the impact I'm gonna put these back on my head here first thing to note here having these on at a zero setting is actually kind of beyond zero so you may think of zero as like okay no noise cancelling but you're gonna have the isolation associated with the ear cup that's not what it is I would consider it almost a plus because right now the microphones are feeding through to my ears I can hear my surroundings perfectly like it's like I'm not wearing headphones I could have a conversation with you Kurt I could have a conversation with you Jack say a few words Jennifer to people out how he says uh uh he says um hello a test 90s hip-hop here we go okay killing me softly that's a great start now I can still hear my own voice okay Fuji sounds alright nobody remembers Pras except he did have a hit track actually he didn't have a hit of his own after the Fugees and it was part of soundtrack to that movie called Bulworth and the song was ghetto superstar you see what I just did here's prize right here the supreme being team hoping up on the scene and there was um that selling raps Halle Berry was in the movie sound quality they sound good I'm not blown away at a zero setting just for the purpose of I'm going all the way to ten oh wow it's such an odd let me play the music now [Music] you know they're good sounding headphones I'm not hmm I'm not blown away it's not Magic Kingdom they're in the same territory and wheelhouse you know like I could interchange these with the other ones that I've been using the thing that's kind of a little upsetting to me is the app some of the EQ stuff and the enhancement stuff on on a Sony site actually it really changes your experience lets you tune in your experience that's kind of missing here a little bit comparatively this feels futuristic to me looks futuristic Beau's gonna sell a lot of these they're gonna sell for years on a momentum of having been at the forefront of that noise-canceling situation but I really do feel that Sony has caught up in their latest flagship headphone products they've caught up to a point now where it's not necessarily obvious why you're going this direction and the way you're gonna make this decision has less to do with noise cancelling performance and more to do with these various other attributes that I'm mentioning because to me it's not mega discernable and I if I had to give an edge I actually might even give it still give it to the Sony headphones think the major edge here is in the the clout associated with the name and the futuristic appearance this is a slightly more ambitious and therefore potentially iconic design what's my price on this Willie do so it's $400 now I know through discounts a Sony guy coming down 350 350 $50 difference now it's gonna be a hard choice for you you're not gonna go terribly wrong either direction the Android app thing you know gave me a bit of a scare not gonna lie I assume Bose is gonna fix it Bose you're watching this video go fix the Android app please okay I honestly can't steer you one way or the other I give the app edge right now to Sony there's a few more features and functions the overall sound potential with the configurability and so forth probably to the Sony the package the design of giving it to this practice product wins in there so you've got to decide I guess where lines up for you I will be completely happy to wear that thing and get it in the silver as well so it looks even more futuristic you're on your Jetsons vibe Star Trek Star Wars Stargate Star everything

10:22:44.970461, have you ever found it hard to make a decision because you have too many options well that's exactly what she'll go through if you're trying to buy the best affordable pair of truly wireless earphones honestly I think a lot of people just get overwhelmed and say forget it I'll just pony up the dough for some air pods but that sucks air pods are expensive which is why we bought the top-50 wireless earphones for under $100 from amazon.com and went through the pain staking tedium of trying out every single one of them so stick around and I'll tell you which ones suck and why and which select few are actually worth a closer look but first a closer look at our sponsor Origin PC customized an Origin PC desktop powered by an NVIDIA GeForce r-tx graphics card pair with a GC monitor for a fast refresh rate and an edge on your competition learn more at the link below first we'll eliminate the ones that obviously suck Relaxo tws i7o this case is brutal these feel super cheap no you're done okay oh this is a big boy what are these what kind of design is that like it's so far from my head why something any sense this one actually has a nice weight to it like it's kind of heavy in a good way although I'm not sure that I would want anything in my pocket to be heavier than it needs to be it's a little hard to open though which is annoying but Shante you stay okay for sixty dollars this is not an acceptable charging case this is annoying to have in your pocket or whoa it actually recognizable brand nice buttons that I really like the skin on them these are actually pretty cool hold up why is this so huge it's only 400 really amp-hours this one 600 not a chance you're done oh these are a little different okay whoa wait a second this has a lid I can lose whoa okay it snaps on there pretty good I'm not gonna eliminate them now for that was close focus power f10 this is there's only one really what are you thinking there's only one unbelievable okay focus power it's your chance at redemption that's a nice lid noise okay these are maybe the nicest one so far and finally skull candy I used to think these were so cool when I was a kid but I'm giving these a hard no these are pretty bad especially for the price [Music] Oh like this is a nice tactile button but it's a way too loud oh yeah that's just right in my brain next now these buttons these are nice doesn't take a lot of force you can skip tracks forward and backwards you can play in pause and those operations are what I'm gonna consider baseline for all these headphones here these are pretty good unfortunately you do have to use your phone to adjust volume up and down though but these can stay ok these ones these actually have a touch interface for 20 bucks which is pretty awesome and they have volume control on the ear but can't be that right well except that it's kind of Jencks so to turn the music up you just hold it down which is sweet because you can just hold your finger there and crank it but to hold it down you have to tap it and you might think ok if you want to turn it on fast you just tap really fast but no because that'll register a double tap which is a different command these ones are even worse it's three taps to adjust the volume but only two taps to Hale the assistant so I just keep getting the assistant more like pass on me am i right I'm right can't skip tracks backwards these bad boys actually have dedicated buttons for volume up and down on each earphone but they're so small and hard to press that you end up kind of jamming the whole earphone into your ear every time you press them and not only that but they're asymmetrical on this one the volume buttons back here and on this one the volume buttons at the front strike three [Music] finally this is the only pair of the whole lot that gets the interface right in my opinion single tap for pause double tap for next triple tap for back hold on the right one for volume up hold on the left one for volume down nailed it you stay tech taka Enka fire going ovate andrade max the tribe has spoken now this round is completely subjective but my ears really like the fit of the Ray Connie 50s and this sound with bionics these are not going anywhere I did not like the rock and pace because a they hurt and B even though the round you do have to take care of when you put them in so that it's button is kind of facing out so you can actually access it and even then you usually have to use two fingers to press the button these ones just hurt these ones also hurt and when I pulled it out of my ear the ear tip actually got stuck in my ear and that's unsettling so I still have about 20 pairs of headphones left and at this point they're mostly okay so rather than finding reasons to eliminate them instead I'm gonna identify the keepers that stood out to me during my testing well we've shared an incredible week together and it's one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make but I only have ten roses gee whack will you accept this rose treble of x-5 will you accept this rose sound core rate Connie 50s burek or 3x e 20s f16 branya will you accept this rose and for my final rose [Music] by on it will you accept this rose introducing my top 10 after one of the toughest days of the office ever I was able to separate the wheat from the chaff and narrow down to the final four which I think are all good for different reasons starting with the cheapest these get sold under many different names on Amazon but the ones that we have are called the G WAC jay29 they've got the best button interface of the whole bunch a case that's reasonably compact despite its 800 milliamp battery and absolutely pounding bass which is great if you listen to EDM or hip-hop but can be a bit overbearing if you listen to metal next it's the sound with bionics which are my pick for a budget truly wireless to use while exercising on account of the great fit they're just super in there and the nice rubber sleeves the case isn't my favorite but it does the job these are just kind of all-around decent bumping up in price the Ray cons are back and they might be my overall top pick these sound great with any genre unless you're like a total bass head and they have the absolute best voice alerts they have fantastic battery life they're just nice to use Oh God and they come in multiple colors and finally we've got the JBL free ex they were at the top of our price limit but the sound from these to me seemed like a cut above the rest they're just super clear at least until you max out the volume the case is a bit large but it is 1500 milliamp hours netting you 5 extra charges and the list so satisfying it's like you're basically getting a free fidget toy in the box now to be clear we're not saying that no one should buy premium wireless earphones like apples air pods or power beats pros if you want something that's very likely to be good and comes with warranty support that you can count on then those are totally an option but for everyone else we are really confident that you will probably like any of these especially for the cost so go check them out at the link in the description the Flair mini from sound core by Anchor has a ton of great features it's got 360 degree audio which means it sounds great from every direction it features neodymium drivers as well as their base up technology for the dual passive radiators and of course their halo LED for that RGB it's got a bunch of light effects with audio fireworks it can phase pulse and glow with the rhythm it's pool-party proof with ipx7 water protection and features a high efficiency you lithium-ion battery for up to 12 hours of sound and lights it connects via bluetooth and you can use

under|Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless Review|Apple Airpod Pro Review,2020-10-07 10:22:44.970488, hey folks I'm Jimmy with Jim's Revere I just had the best Korean barbecue so I'm in this slight food coma phase right now if you haven't had it you've got to go out and get something I've had to take a shower just now because I reaped of like charcoal beef pork whatever I'm saying like it's a bad thing right here damn it I should review food for god sakes anyways staying focused I have my list of the best truly wild earphones that I've personally tested compared and provided videos on right here on this channel as you guys know I'm here to help you guys make that purchase decision check out the pros and cons in their respective videos down in that video description also if you need the most updated prices in real time our place might feel linked down in that video description below as well click on those links to see if they're on sale hopefully there's some deals going on at the moment don't pay retail I'm telling you these things are always slashing prices anyways folks let's start here with number 5 here is the smallest lightest and least cumbersome truly round earphones that you can buy if these Samsung Galaxy buds now why are they on my list they sit basically the most flush against my ears they stay in ridiculously well and the case is the smallest that I've tested probably so far on the channel you get the latest technology which is USB see you get wireless charging and fast charging with the case the next set of features is audio pass-through if you want to hear your environment you could have your audio pumped in with the built-in microphones so you don't get assaulted robbed hit by bus all at the same time here you probably having a crappy day but anyways here you basically hear your environment for safety and awareness you hear me mention audio pastor quite a bit throughout this video now better life is rated at 6 hours and with my test I got 6 hours and 24 minutes of real-world testing and this is on par with many other truly wireless earphones on the market you also get Bluetooth 5.0 on the earphone the Bluetooth technology played perfectly fine with video as well with my more recent tests on my new pixel for Excel and last you do get multi paired if you need to switch your Bluetooth source just tap on the latest device and the audio will basically switch over now the earphones offers touch sensitivity controls skipper go back on your music there's no physical buns found on these things here and I personally like that you're also getting an app where you can find your earbuds if you ever forget them somewhere or if you freaking lose them or so but part of the galaxy buds number five and not higher or basically lower on this list the waterproofing is unfortunately limited to an IP two rating which is one of the lowest that I've seen the IP two designation means you can only get water on days up to a 15 degree angle this can't even take on a splash of water doesn't mean you shouldn't buy these as you might not sweat like some and you might not bend over more than 15 degrees here you might not need the waterproofing at all it's your call now also in busy environments phone calls did absolutely terrible from my testing as demonstrated in my review but for the bread-and-butter here how is the audio the guilty but I think are perfect as everyday earbuds for casual listening to it from work and the type of earbuds that if you do lose them you'll be pissed but you won't be like damn I ate ramen for several weeks to save up for these kind of pissed hopefully that makes sense and these are around $100 or so give or take $20 as I've seen them on sale all over the place here don't pay retail click on my felt links that in at the description ident for the most updated prices alright folks let's get into number four the best budget non name-brand a little bit of a smaller company type of earphones who has the best budget your phones on the market I kept going back to the Aki T tens now they're not as flush against my ears or minimus looking as the galaxy buds but it's very reasonable and if anything very similar to other small truly wireless earphones out there in regards to size but for a very similar price of the Galaxy buds you get bluetooth 5.0 you get USB C and the case you also get better better life at up to seven hours you get better waterproofing at an IP five rating which means that it can take on low pressure water jet sprays you get wireless charging that's so many more expensive models don't even get and I personally like Lee touch sensitivity surface over the physical buttons you do get that here and I did test this with video YouTube and Netflix played perfectly fine without lip-syncing issues which were notorious on other older truly wireless earphones now the icing on the cake the audio is better than the Samsung Galaxy buds it took me by surprise but the audio direction here and the soundstage is there and it sounded great for a $100 price range pair of truly wireless earphones the only thing here though that didn't make it basically it was complete letdown for me there's no audio pass through I love it when I have the option to hear my environment again for safety and awareness you don't get that with the t10 and lastly carrying case again USB C wireless charging in again slim enough for me right here it is a unique design but sometimes the earphones snag a bit when I try to put them back in a switch when I first bought it you need to build up a little bit of muscle memory know if you're okay with those two little hiccups here no audio pass through in the cases little little funky hears in the very beginning that is I still highly recommended t10 so there's tons of value when I reviewed him they were on sale I would highly recommend them keep eye on these give them a try again links are down in that video description alright moving on number three here who has the best audio performance now I know it's not my number one pick here and it seems kind of odd since he sounds so freaking good but I'll get into detail why very soon but these are the best sounding no question when I want the gym the hell out I pop these blingy earphones in today indeed ascend hazard momentum true Wireless has these same specs as the best of the best out there such as Bluetooth 5.0 USB see the case looks freaking good here I confirm these works great with video as well you get this thing called app X that confirms that these earphones can transfer audio at a higher bitrate than most out there you get waterproofing and an IP 4 rating which means that this can't take out splashes it doesn't take out those low jet sprays as I mentioned earlier audio pastor is available and it sounds quite natural here I like it touch controls are at your fingertips and in general they look pretty nice in my opinion as for comfort the earphones are a bit thick good for casual everyday use they're perfectly fine they stay to my ears really well for working out though I'm sure some of you guys don't have this issue but for me they are just big and round here I can confidently say they might work for some people but I'm telling you there's more secure earphones out there if your focus is on work out earphones now the reason why these are number three on my list and not any higher is particularly due again to the ergonomics like I said they work fine but something a bit more secure for everyone would have been great but ranking these at number three is largely due to its battery performance five hours is what Sennheiser is claiming and I'm only getting three hours at 40 minutes from our world test several have mentioned better life does drain while the earphones are in the charging case and I'm aware every charge case does have a standby time some better than others but with these Sennheiser's here they're really low I'm usually around five to six days I don't think they fixed it just yet and I haven't noticed it at least comment down below if you guys own these things here and see if this is still happening to you guys how about the Jim's room community let us know now as for audio this is the biggest reason why you would actually buy these here beautiful punchy bass that's very controlled a mid-range that stands out and a lot of depth and dimension and the one area that's very hard to do on these truly rounds earphones for some odd reason here is the audio direction in a very good sound stage right here now they said eyes are true Wireless Momentum's here makes me nod to my music it takes me away at times with the right song it simply uh performs everything else on this list in regards to audio I know Sennheiser's have come down in price and for those who have been waiting this might be the time to jump on these things again most updated prices are in that video description this was earphone number three now number two here best workout earphones it came down to these three power feet pros Jabra 675 C's that is whoops and BJ Bird boosters the power B pros didn't provide the best base out of the three which might be shocking for many here but what it does have is excellent in seamless parent there's multi parent with devices that switches back and forth ridiculously easy there's better life that's class leading at nine hours and possibly the biggest reason why you would pick is over the others are the earhooks I love these things as no matter what I do obviously these things never fall off if you don't like in-ear earphones like all the other truly your phones on this list these actually sits somewhat on the outside of your ear can oh they technically don't jam in there now there is water resistance and these although directly on beats website it doesn't have an ingress rating but there is some form of water protection that is claimed I drew some water all over these things here and I'm still using my power B pros say day now the drawbar 75 tees I'm really liking as they're almost as small and as light as these Samsung Galaxy buds but provides much better audio there's an IP five water resistant rating making these protected against not just splashes but also again those low pressure water jet sprays battery life is above average at it claimed seven and a half hours the drummers are quite straightforward with the essentials like audio pass-through multi parent Bluetooth 5.0 us PC I'm in charging case and also fast charging you just don't get wireless charging on this thing look how slim this thing is to now the J professors also have similar features like bluetooth 5.0 USB C fast charging and such the IP rating on this is actually a number seven meaning this can be submerged underwater for a short period of time this part of the most rugged out of the entire list that I have here now one of the biggest perks here the jaybird app with its built-in equalizer on the many features that it's on that app allows you to fine-tune the audio to your liking and it is very very responsive but audio quality wise though I compared the Jaybirds with the other two and shockingly the others offers a bit more finesse you can say the vistas sound signature is very loud it's in-your-face and many of the audio frequencies are very punchy and sharp you might like that at the time of the review when I did this several months ago although the equalizer is available and it does help though but some of that aggressive characteristics are unfortunately still there now although the draw bras were heavily bass boosted when I first bought them before tuning them as you can always turn them down within their app as well there's a little built-in equalizer once and compare them back-to-back comparing to the vistas that Jarrah sounded cleaner compared to the power B pros this has the jobbers had a little bit more character a little bit more dimension to it Audio so in the end here I went with the Java 75 T's for the best workout earphones I used to love the Jaybirds they still fit great they have excellent features loved their app but there's just better audio out there nowadays now I love the ear hooks on the power B pros but I like the audio the best I need Jabra 75 T's it's just comfortable it's light its small and just enough for me you can say that John 475 T's are happy very much right temperature again folks all the updated prices are down in that better description below for you guys to check out alright folks so in the last category here who has the best active noise-cancelling earphones many of you guys are wondering which one is better Apple earpods or the Saudi WF 1000 X M threes here is a quick rundown so Sony I think looks better it looks classier it looks less sterile than the Apple air pub pros they don't stick up past my ears which is great that's just in general but they are further extended from my ear canal and don't necessarily fill out the bowl of my ear in turn if you're a pretty active person they do tend to bounce a little more than the ear pod pros and yes I've tried all the ear tips and really twisted them into my ears for a nice seal but speaking of being active if you do sweat a lot I wouldn't risk it the Sony's unfortunately don't have any waterproofing and I don't sweat a lot and I don't run in the rain of course so to be fair that isn't a deal-breaker depending on your situation now the air pad pros here have these little stems which do look a lot better than any previous generations in addition the new ear tips are now in your earphones with the older models they usually sit on the outside of your ear canal in turn they didn't provide a barely any passive noise isolation the new ear pad pros although they do sit in the ear canal a little bit more provide a little bit more passive noise isolation they are comfortable it hands down more comfortable than the 1000x m3s for my small ears now I would highlight this part here for the Apple earpods they stay in the ear ridiculously well while feeling the least intrusive it is light its Airy I can run jog and jump with these things on and I've never had an issue with them also these are water resistant with an IP 4 rating MIDI they can take out a splash of water unlike the Samsung Galaxy buds you can actually bend over with these and get water on them but no exaggeration anyways they fit amazingly now getting two features none of these mofos have volume controls what the hell I know you can use your voice assistance or whip out your phone but when I'm barlas I wanna be away from my phone at the gym I don't want to take the phone out when I'm in another room I don't want to go grab the phone just adjust volume when I'm trying not to use my phone as my fan say she thinks I'm on tinder when my phone are in my skinny jeans and I can't get them out because my jeans are too tight I mean I don't know I don't wear skinny jeans I'm actually wearing sleeping pants right now but anyways besides the point here I'm just joking with you guys well except the pants I like I said I just got out the shower here but you guys get the idea now what you do get though in the features Department sony has a lot touch controls who pause and play in other various actions you do get audio pastor you get adaptive noise cancelling that adjusts ANC based on your movements which kind of work is not a hundred percent per my review with the air pods they're pros the connection on these things work slightly faster and it feels seamless when switching between devices Sony does great but there's just something about Apple that gives it a bit more finesse basically the air pod pros have a force sensor where you can squeeze to pause and play and skipping on your music but if you hold down the left ear phone you can activate audio pastor or turn on or off active noise-cancelling now as a side of the noise canceling does work or the button features do work with Android as well you don't need an iPhone which is pretty cool now both have bluetooth 5.0 both play perfectly fine with video with no syncing delays both have fast charging and as for battery life peruse I never realised this but when I test the Sony months ago I achieved six hours in 23 minutes I recently tested the air pod pros I also achieved the same exact results six hours in 23 minutes at 50% vibe with ANC on at 100% on both and with the same exact playlist it's quite interesting so I got to give it to Apple for comfort Sony for looks and style I guess it just really boils down to active noise cancelling and audio performance now I recently tested them back to back again here and for the active noise-cancelling performance the earpods canceled more noise I know reviewers were saying the Sony did better I'm gonna stand my ground on this one I noticed Apple cancels out more on the low-end audio frequency than Sony did in general also people talking nearby Sena to be canceled more so on the Apple earpods pros again more than he's Sony WF 1000x m3s and I've done this back to back and I'm multiple occasions now over the past month or so that was just my experience and it is has been consistent but honestly when you have music going on either one of these you're honestly fine the passive noise isolation plus whichever device you choose with the ANC going on plus whatever music you're playing that already can't sell a lot of your environmental noises already I would say if you listen to podcast or listen to audio very low in general I would favor the air pods in this case but if you're going music heavy now Sony takes the cake the air pod pros provides very clean easy to listen to and pleasing a pleasing audio signature that is its distortion free it's clear it's consistent all great but the Sony as cheesy as it sounds I just nod to my music a little bit more often it's bass here there's a bit more dimension on these Sony's a bit more depth to my music and not to mention the EQ within the Sony app provides a bit more versatility as well the audio simply sounds better on a WF 1000 XM threes so with all these choices here which one is my best earphone for the year here now honestly there isn't one but there is one that somewhat takes almost all these boxes for the time being maybe not the best in one category but it does well overall and you got to give some praise to the that's the draw bruh 75 T's that gets my pick if I can find it on my table here now you get the latest features again bluetooth 5.0 audio pastor great for video no syncing delays there's the battery life is slightly above average rated at seven and a half hours this has multi pairing a very small carrying case a very good water-resistant rating although the drummer's uses buns but they're very sensitive and works flawlessly not to mention you get all the controls including volume they're not as small the Samsung Galaxy buds but there these smaller ones small the truly rods earphones that have tested on the market at the moment you guys can see here it's really discreet here now although they don't have ear hooks like the power B pros to keep these earphones on my ears no matter what though they're much better than maybe big and huge really where I listen your phones out there during my time testing with them running I've never had an issue with them and they stay in the ear really really well they look good they sound good again not as good as the $350 retail price for these Sennheiser Momentum's but definitely the Jabra 75 T's don't sound as cheap as the $100 price range it comes with an app to tune these things as well to your liking and although this doesn't have active noise canceling Jabra actually promotes this and I did confirm this within my test during my review these actually have very good passive noise isolation for truly wireless earphones I actually hear myself my own voice is a little bit muffled right now so as you guys can see with my quick run down list with a dropper 7/5 T's these are the most well rounded pair of truly world's ear phones I've encountered so far if you do buy them as I mentioned in my review let the earphones burn in for several days of use that is and definitely use the app to turn down the bass just a smidge right there they are pretty bass heavy earphones but overall this might not blow every category out the water but it has ticked the most boxes on my list out there in my humble opinion I highly highly

There is also a bag with various adapters I tried it, the cable works well, but unfortunately, if you want to use it with Pixel 2XL, you still have to adapt Inlight microphone There are also control buttons, if you don’t want to use the touchpad to control, this can come in handy This headset has a small detail I like very much Is the way the headset is turned on No power button You just need to unfold the headset into its normal form and it will be turned on This design is so genius, you don’t need to turn it on There is a physical button to control the degree of noise reduction From 0, to 1, to 50 Also, the sound effect button According to the song you listen to, use this button to change the sound effect of the headset Finally, this should be my favorite switch Here, a dedicated Bluetooth button This way you know whether Bluetooth is on or off Take a look, Bluetooth is on, good Now, I think I need to wear headphones to let you know why this headset is so great I put on headphones A good seal is formed on both sides, look at this shape Is the shape of the human ear Streamlined design Streamlined materials and light weight This headset is really super light This design is to let you enjoy music and movies better If a headset is uncomfortable to wear, then the sound quality is not important Once Will wore this headset I asked him: ""What do you think?"" He said: ""I can't even notice his existence when it is light."" So this is not just my side The soft rubber on the top and sides of the earphones are very comfortable Sound insulation is great Noise reduction mode, and non-noise reduction mode, you can hear the difference immediately Then I double click on the touchpad Non-noise reduction mode Has been activated, I can hear my own voice Can hear Will's voice I can just go out and order a Frappuccino with headphones They might think I’m a bit anti-social, so they don’t talk to me You know, it's pretty cold outside Everyone will encounter this kind of thing, and you are no exception Then you go back to noise reduction mode and the music starts Of course, sometimes you still have to talk to people They made an app called Captune So you can adjust it to your liking Here you can adjust Noisegard, it is now 50% But i can turn it down Adjust to 30, or directly 100 I can adjust it here, I can use the physical button to adjust it, or I can turn it off directly Noise-canceling headphones have a place that annoys me If I am at home, it is quiet So why should I consume power to reduce noise? And those noise-canceling headphones are made like a fish tank You can directly see the remaining power of the headset, which is also very important But it’s not over yet, you can use this as a music player Multiple library options The software also has a built-in equalizer Various presets, such as Hiphop, Rock, Flat Of course you can also customize the configuration yourself FX takes effect on the basis of the equalizer, and the effect button on the headset is used for this purpose From clubs, to movies, to speeches, to director mode This is very important You want to enjoy the best sound quality of movies and music You might want more bass Listen to music and want a stronger thrust Want better movie sound effects, better speech effects, and clearer sound Can choose Okay, finally I’m going to try listening to music, I’m going to try a few more styles of music Try listening to hiphop in club mode There is a volume setting on the phone, but don’t forget that you can also control it on the headset Hello, I want to order a Frappuccino, Macchiato Bye~ If you listen to hiphop The effect of this headset will never let you down Excellent sound insulation, abundant bass, and equalizer blessing And the FX settings of the club That's it I will try another style song So be it Can't you keep watching me listening to songs? You will be very happy after buying this back. Because I tried so many headphones, I chose this one in the end Think about the features I showed you Think again about Sennheiser’s sound effects It's a perfect match ""I forgot I was wearing headphones"" Maybe you find me watching ""Rip Van Winkle"" on the sofa, my beard is all white, and a few years have passed. Don’t think about it, the conclusion is simple, just buy this"

Sony WF 1000x truly wireless earphones they still haven't fixed my syncing issue from the left to right your bud and after reading the comments from my fans out there they're still having the same exact problem so I went ahead and moved on and bought these these are the Bose sound sport freeze they're also truly wireless earphones and I personally paid for them I paid $250 at the time of this video as always I placed my affiliate links down in that video description below click on those links and they'll give you the most updated prices in real time you'd never know when these things might go ahead sale so without further ado I'm here to help you make that purchase decision welcome everyone to another review alright folks the sound sport freeze looks practically identical to this sound sports just without the wires in between now both sides are covered with a glossy plastic that fades from black to a deep golden brown or bronze it's subtle but it surely makes the earphones look quite premium now on the sides they're rubberized giving them a nice grip eNOS when you're pulling these in and out of your ears they're also ipx4 rated meeting they can withstand water splashes and rain if you're caught out there and with our testing of splashing water on this the sound sports fries are still functioning perfectly fine now the sound sports are ultra comfortable because of the super stuff stay here plus ear tips now this has been bose is a unique design for a while now and it works for most people now I'll label them as being ultra comfortable because they're not technically in ear earphones that means the ear tip doesn't go into your ear canal now this is perfect if you have sensitive ears and don't mind losing passive noise isolation now you do get the safety of hearing your environment while we're walking or running on the opposite end though because they're not blocking out noise again no passive noise isolation you do lose a little bit of audio immersion and at higher volumes they do sound leaked in good bits it's a trade-off that you'll need to take into consideration now they did say my ear is quite well better than my j-bird runs not the best is they do weigh a bit more than most of the competition out there it weighs in at 14 grams on each earbud per Bose but the flange ear tips again does very well preventing them from falling out the only issue and I'm gonna put these in my ear here they stick out like a mofo when you look straight on now this is completely subjective but at least for me they do look a little too funky for my taste again that's up to you guys taking a closer look at these sounds port freeze boast skipped a power button on these earphones when you pull them from the case they automatically turn on for media and call control everything is on the right earphone bime up and down on either side and then there's in the middle a Bose multifunction button now with a single tap you can pause and play music with double and triple presses you can skip and go forward on songs holding it down for one second brings up either Siri or Google assistant now if a phone call it does come in you can press that multi and fun once again to answer it now we tested the phone call quality at the office and of course outdoors and they came across very clear and I was actually quite surprised at how good they were with most of the competitors I've tested are the headphones and wired earphones and such they do pick up a good bit of background noise but the sound sport freeze did very well and kept a lot of the ambient noise around me to a minimum now on the left earphone there is one button here which allows you to quickly switch between up to seven devices yes and I'll repeat that again up to seven devices all at the same time now the only issue that I noticed the buns are quite hard to press here especially when you have it in your ears I can find them easily though but pressing them takes a lot more effort than the competitors out there firm presses are needed to adjust these things now finally included with the earphones is this exceptional case that I have right here it's made of a durable matte black plastic and keeps the air phone safe now something that's really helpful and really cool that connecting pins are magnetic securing the earphones in place without any buttons or snaps it also helps align the ear buds here and most importantly less chance of them falling out of my case now the case itself also doubles as a charger providing two additional phone charges when the earphones are docked and pressing on the button to open the case also shows you five white LED indicator lights giving you an idea of how much better life is left on the earphones in or the case now Bose claims you can get up to five hours worth of use putting the sound support freeze at the top end of the competition matched only by the Apple earpods now in my battery test play music at 50% vibe from a full battery to dead the earphones made it 4 hours and 42 minutes with a 10 minutes low battery warning pretty darn good for lazier votes now they also offer quick charging within 15 minutes of charging this thing here it provides for 45 minutes of use to fully charge it it takes about two hours now Bluetooth range was also phenomenal with my iPhone and the office pixel except I found them to get around 68 to 72 linear feet of distance before cutting out and that's with a straight line of sight and last but at least finally I ran across some truly wireless earphones that has a fine my buds feature I know the Apple earpods has theirs but it's rare that I run across truly wireless earphones that offers some peace of mind like this simply largely Bose connect tapi fine my buds tab and you'll get a specific map pin to each ear phones last bluetooth paired location furthermore you can have them emit a high-pitched tone so if they're in the grass or just under your bed you hear exactly where they are that's a clarifying they don't have GPS so if they've been moved you won't be able to see their current location since I'm showing you the app some of the other features that you can adjust are an auto shutoff timer voice prompts and language studies other than that the Bose app is really plain Jane and doesn't offer much alright folks so let's move on to what might be the most important part of the review besides how it looks to me is the audio test let me start off by saying these sat flippin great here balance clarity and fidelity are the key words here a sound support frees provide a very high resolution sound that's also accurate to the music now these do get loud enough I found myself often listening to around 60% of I'm but would sometimes bump it up to 75 to 80% during those really intense songs I listen to a DM and hip hop the classic rock and folk even retro wave and you guys got to get up on that they all sounded great shadows I would say that really shine were classic rock and pop music with these earphones now bass was president punchy for small earphones they didn't sound bass boosted like my j-bird runs which I'll admit I do love I like some moderate bass my audio but for the boats it was just a cleaner sound it didn't sound synthetic there's no distortion it's full-bodied and just enough for most generous of music to be enjoyed now if you ever listen to their boast QC 35 agency headphones it's a very similar characteristic now the mid-range is where the sound support fries really shines through the mid ranges when you hear most instruments like guitars strings and woodwinds as well as vocals resolution and detail was very very much apparent here all sounds were distinguishable and crisp without being recessed in electronic music those bright resonating notes that provide a feeling of energy and excitement are reproduced with fidelity and precision now vocals were pushed forward which I love and most of my viewers enjoyed as well allowing you to hear them clearly and with separation that moderate vibe detail and articulation filled out the higher frequencies here the treble were not sharp but gets to a point where you can appreciate the cymbal crashes to the higher pitch wayde's on EDM and pop music at the higher volumes that's where you do lose a little bit of definition to prevent brass penis or ear singing but honestly overall they provided a fantastic audio experience without any listening fatigue I was able to wear these for an entire battery cycle with no problems now the last part here this is a unique situation the fans who have been farming for quite some time you guys know I love it wide an open sound stage with the sound sport freeze it does absolutely great with audio separation for Tomba left and right audio channels we're tell about hearing vocals in the forefront so maybe some drums a little bit further back but the sound stage it is there but it isn't as wide as expected and here's the big but here the audio is perceived as though it's coming from the center of your head yes right in the center here now it sounds crazy but it's as though you're sitting written from the artist or maybe standing right in front of them there's concert speakers it's a different level of immersion a different type of immersion that's not experienced too often play immersion or immersive experience nonetheless now I would say it's something you got a trial test out your old earphones I've been trying these and hear the difference again it's quite unique now one last thing I know Sony was getting a lot of heat in my previous review one of the reasons was due to the WF 1,000 X's having a delay watching video it was the same here of the sound sports unfortunately there's a second or two delay when you're watching after speak to the time that you hear it in your earphones now this might be an issue across all truly wireless earphones because they have to sync with each other to play at the same time either or I just want to give you guys a heads up I'm bat so overall the Bose sound support fries are a solid product they sounded phenomenal here and I can't stress that enough although they looked huge as crap in my ears right now but again looks are subjective but just to quickly end this video if they look good to you definitely give these a try but folks be sure to LIKE and subscribe to help support my work I'm Jimmy o'james reviewer and I'm here to help you make that purchase decision you guys take care and I'll see you guys on the next one [Music]"

Canucks|HardwareCanucks,2020-10-07 10:22:44.970660, what a great second day of spring it's nice to stay in so let the gaming wireless headset battle begin hello good people I'm Dimitri and if you've been considering getting a wireless headset you have come to the right place because behind me I have razor Logitech SteelSeries Corsair and HyperX so let's see which one is best right after this it's always a pleasure upgrading or adding new hardware to your system especially when it comes to storage like this new OC ZTR 200 drive from Toshiba it's a great value SSD offers a nice boost in performance for boot times file transfers and just general system and work operation with cutting-edge 3d flash memory and ultra reliable controller with built-in power management consider the upgrade today with TR 200 it's available in different capacities check it out below this work see no wires it's amazing oh alright guys so let's begin this one's gonna be one epic roundup if you want to check out individual views of the headsets that we have done reviews of they'll be linked in the description and also that's where you'll find links to purchase any of these bad boys and to smooth out your viewing experience the timecode for this video will be pinned in the comments so let's go alright so let's start with the price under $100 we only have two pairs the Corsair Void Pro Wireless RGB and the Logitech G533 stepping up under $200 we've got the SteelSeries Arctis 7 the Logitech G933 the Razer man o war from 2016 and the new HyperX cloud flight is up here too at $159 and if you've got really big bucks to spend the Razer Thresher ultimate will shred your wallet for sure but not as much as the SteelSeries Arctis Pro Wireless with that a little bit of an insane $329 price now before we dive right in leave your predictions on let's say who will win the headset roundup in the comments below and then come back to it after you've seen the conclusion now I normally don't talk about packaging but of course the cult will appreciate the recognition plus they're the only ones to have plastic covered the velvet material I do like Corsairs approach to simplified packaging and HyperX flight with all the cables right at the surface whereas a steel series buries all their accessories and tiny boxes and logitech is the only one to have their headset wrapped now the number of accessories kind of follows the price point they all charge via micro USB cable which is included with each headset along with some derivative of a USB dongle so either a thumb stick style or the extension style so you can expand your reach or close the distance between the headset now the Thresher ultimate comes with a hub since it's a ps4 Edition so that's where you plug in the optical cable and charge the headset through the hub as well a plastic headphone stem is included with some clothes resemblance to this Imperial shuttle from Star Wars not sure if that's intentional or not while the most expensive pair the Arctis Pro Wireless has all the cables and double the batteries and the control hub that's also your receiver and a charging dock for the removable batteries so if you want a simplified wireless setup or are traveling want to minimize cable work all the pair's with the simple USB dongle would obviously be more convenient so like the void Pro the HyperX cloud flight both large tech pairs and the Razer Man o war that has a tiny receiver actually built-in into the ear cup while on the logitech g933 we actually have a specific compartment inside the ear cup to store the receiver but for those that do not have any compartments you can simply tuck it away inside the ear cup like this to safely keep the receiver with the headset now build quality varies between these headsets significantly and it doesn't necessarily follow the price point either the most robust pair is the still series arctas pro also being the most expensive with the quality metal headband aluminum hinges and everything just feels awesome the only problem is you cannot expand them because they rely on this self adjusting fabric piece and the same goes with the Arctis 7 but these have plastic hinges which are a little bit more loose and weirdly following after that would be the coarser void pro which happens to be also the cheapest pair they are nicely balanced weight wise metal hinges are not to lose and they feel like they can withstand some unnecessary force like if they drop from a table or you know if you flip them across the room the microphone though feels cheap you know the actual arm might lose resistance over time so that's the only negative I do like the lightweight nature of the HyperX flight the hinges feel fine but you have to be very careful with an all-plastic body and that seems to be the compromise for these because they're super lightweight so that's a positive and they kind of feel like that bose noise-canceling headphones too but when I'm stretching out them on the sides the plastic stretches too so just have to be careful and be cautious of their built quality the logitech g933 comes next with the robust plastic body that does not creak all over the place the hinges are not too loose and the extension mechanism stays in place - they're a little bit deceiving with this metallic surface but it does play on your perception of it feeling like a high quality build the Razer Thresher ultimate is quiet light thanks to the thin metal headband and plastic everything else the hinges worry me a little bit but they shouldn't have any issues with supporting the full weight of the headset the only thing that bothers me with the Thresher are the hinges and their corners are super sharp so if they're around your neck they could cut you Northcutt true but scratch you and the same thing if like you put your finger there while you're taking them off it's not a pleasant experience unfortunately the worst build quality goes to the Razer man o war they are bulky plasticy hinges are super loose and actually have a history of the middle headband piece breaking because it's not well attached and also the Logitech G533 they just feel super cheap and the hinges have absolutely no control so the ear cups just wobble all the time and this headset has glossy sides if you like that dirty look and the only quality element is the expansion mechanism what this is going on right now now before we completely give up on headsets that have really subpar build quality I want to say that throughout my testing with these there is a balance between you know build quality sound quality comfort value features and so it's kind of like a mixed bag there is no perfect headset in ass lineup and that's a bit unfortunate but just keep that in mind for later in the video and so now let's move on to comfort majority of these are awesome lightweight so you can wear them for hours until the battery dies and to no significant clamping force for any of these so my favorite would be the HyperX cloud flight with fantastic ear cup isolation extra interior padding and they also expand for larger heads no problem and fold on your neck in this nice low profile both logitech pairs have large and deep cushions awesome fit over all the G933 has smooth air padding all around while the newer G933 has this harsh bathing suit material that are super and pleasant on your skin both of them fold in your neck which are a little bit chunky on your ear cups but not uncomfortable seriously so this is the 533 hear how the sounds I could shower with this you know substitute my spongebob sponge sponge versus the 933 you may not hear the difference but I definitely feel difference the 933 is much smoother the 533 is way harsh like sandpaper on your skin which is super unpleasant by the way when it's right by your ears now the void Pro has angular cushions so the cover my ears very well with nice pressure distribution to they fold in this non choking slim profile on your neck the round cushions on the Thresher ultimate are fine they are large and will cover your entire ear clamping force is pretty weak to avoid pressure buildup but heat concentration is present and despite being the largest headset in this round up default on my neck just fine without any mobility issues the men-of-war headset has the same round ear cup design but a tighter fit and less comfortable headband with more pressure from the top and because they fold on this angle keeping them on your neck is really uncomfortable now the artist Pro Wireless comes with deeper cushions and slightly expanded headband versus the Arctis 7 but since they're not really size adjustable it won't be comfortable for larger heads and both of them like to choke you when placed around your neck the Arctis 7 more so because of the tighter headband and so the 3 oddballs would be the 2 SteelSeries headsets and the razor Man O War something because the razor one has problems with the headband and it's not really comfortable when they're on your neck while the SteelSeries is perfectly fine for smaller heads you know they're okay for me as well but I wish I had a little bit more expansion at the bottom so that I could bring them down a little bit more if I'm wearing hat or something like that but because they choke you when they're around your neck you know if you wear them around your neck and since they're wireless - it's kind of like a perfect thing to leave them on your body when even if you're not listening to something there's a little bit unfortunate with the SteelSeries Arctis Pro and the Arctis 7 the HyperX flight oh man what a comfortable design for on your neck just lovely moving on to features each headset has a power button and mic mute switch and the volume wheel and only the razor pairs the avoid Pro and the Arctis Pro have precise steps for volume all other have terrible control the G933 has three G keys for macros like changing your EQ settings lighting or whatever else and both SteelSeries pairs include a headphone share port which is quite unique the Arctis 7 has a dial for chat mix to balance voice versus in-game volume while the Arctis Pro is the only headset with dual wireless connectivity with bluetooth support so letting you connect this to your notebook or your smartphone without the need for a USB dongle now the hub with the Thresher ultimate is bare-bones in terms of control just the power button in the front and the Dolby surround sound that I don't understand why it's hidden in the corner while the hub on the wireless pro lets you control your EQ mic side tone chatmix basically it's a driver free experience that is appreciated and you have all this control even if you connect it to a ps4 alright so microphone test time so what you're hearing now is that from the Arctis Pro Wireless being the most expensive one how do you think that one sounds now it's clean there's no noise when they stop speaking but the thing is it just sounds like there's way too much compression going on as it tries to cancel out whatever is in the background so next up is the cloud flight I think this one has really aggressive noise compression tries to just like really mute the background and that causes the voice to be muffled not the best sounding microphone in this collection and just like lacks definition and it's not as sharp as the other pair that you just heard what you're hearing now is that from the Logitech G933 this is the oldest headset in this collection and I think it sounds the worst as well it just doesn't have much background compression or any focal compression it just like it picks up way too much ambient stuff and doesn't help to isolate just the voice and the voice doesn't sound that great either so um what are you gonna do luckily the new g5 33 definitely sounds much better it still exhibits a lot of background like noise and hiss despite the trying to cancel that out but the actual vocal range is much improved versus the older g933 the Corsair void Pro is next so this one has really aggressive noise compression and tries to like really cancel out anything so you will have these spikes in terms of volume in terms of your speech so if you're not speaking loud enough it will just completely cut that out so it's not as powerful because it has that really aggressive noise cancellation the next one is the razor Man O War which is also one of the oldest ones in the surround of and it also sounds pretty bad you can see it's very Boomy it doesn't have clarity in the voice and it does have really good like noise compression in terms of the background stuff but yeah it just in terms of the vocal pickup it's not pleasant unfortunately the updated razor had said does not have any improvements in the microphone quality it still sounds very booming there is a you know aggressive background compression too but the vocal definition just completely is lacking in comparison to everything else in this roundup and finally the SteelSeries Arctis 7 it's weird because they all sound the same in terms of how much compression there is for the vocals not just for the background and there's trying to compensate for that you know I'm guessing for like the keyboard switches and typing stuff but it really destroys the any vocal definition and range that you might expect from an actually decent microphone like the microphone on the Sennheiser game one it's been my go-to headset for games because the microphone is just so good lots of body to the sound there's no that nasally compression that we hear on all other gaming headsets not just on this wireless stuff that we're testing today but yeah this has been my definition of like a reference quality microphone on the gaming pair so let me know if you agree so based on that mic test which one sounded best to you I think the worst one would be the G933 which is also the oldest one the Razer pairs have that nice lower end boost which is booming well the rest of them can sound the same they all will kind of have this nasally compression going on in the background so I'm not exactly sure which one wins so you let me know okay so in terms of sound performance they all deliver really powerful output in terms of volume so that's not really an issue but they do have pretty different sound characteristics so if you're looking for the best surround sound experience hands down either of the large stick pairs both create this large soundstage experience without compromising important details with incredible imaging I like feeling the audio cam like in front of you and not just in your headset and even in stereo mode you get amazing definition powerful bass control treble on both and it's really unfortunate that the 533 is so flimsy because the sound and surround sound is just fantastic and adds extra points to this headset overall the next in the chain would be the HyperX cloud flight with a lot of definition precise bass heads and smooth treble and definitely one of the best within this roundup the Corsair voice Pro Wireless are satisfactory with balanced output it's more closed off compared to the HyperX for example but with good detail presentation and bass that's there without overstepping its boundaries now the sound signatures between the SteelSeries headset is completely different they both have awesome detail and really tight bass but the Arctis 7 I prefer more because on the Arctis Pro while is the sound stage is slightly expanded and the treble is brighter which I prefer less and this the Arctis 7 is like overall a more fun signature for me both music and games and lastly that two razor pairs are the most powerful out of the bunch at 60% volume I was totally comfortable in terms of power output now the razor thresher has super harsh travel beyond 60% volume to the point of me needing to like lower it in order to hear anything and regardless of this upper boost it lacks mid-range definition and bass has left the building - in comparison to everything else that's on the list while the men of war has a smoother treble and a more pleasant sound signature in comparison to the thresher but both these would be fantastic for FPS where you can hear every little detail and you don't care about the rest of the spectrum range you know where you want just the really sharpness to hear everything so perhaps for competitive stuff that would be fine but I'm guessing everyone who's be spending money on the wireless gaming headset doesn't want to be just listening to FPS stuff but you want an all-around sound signature that would be compatible for both music movies and games and I would say the razer stuff isn't ready to par for that in terms of the wireless signal all of these in my space are perfectly fine i am able to walk around the space go six meters away with a few walls in between without losing a signal and without hearing any quality loss in audio so in terms of battery life I think the SteelSeries Arctis Pro takes the win easily because of these interchangeable batteries because one of them is constantly charging inside the doc so you just simply swap them out when one dies and you never have to plug it in to charge the headset versus all others need to be plugged in for charging whereas the large tech stuff I really appreciate the battery percentage indicator in the software so you know exactly how much juice you have left and you have to plug them in versus the rest of them in like the Corsair but the Corsair stuff would give you low medium or high in terms of battery life whereas the razor thresher has no software so you cannot even check the battery life everything else can last two days and then you have to be recharging and so depending on how much you use I think I would go for about maybe 10 hours of listening a day for most of these no problem and I would have to recharge it a little bit on the third day so that gives you a little bit of an indication on how often you need to recharge so maximum I would say 2-3 days unlike good heavy use with any of these but still the Arctis Pro because that removable battery easily wins the battery test alright people it is conclusion time and I will give you a few of my favorites first the HyperX cloud flights so they're super comfortable I can wear them for hours they have amazing isolation and sound quality is incredible they are driverless so you don't have to think around stuff it just it is what it is but it is a bit expensive at the hundred sixty bucks so it slightly cheaper options where the cheapest option in this roundup would be the corsair void pro at $80 i'm overall impressed with this the only crappy thing is the boom arm for the microphone it feels kind of flimsy and cheap but in terms of comfort sound quality range and battery life really good stuff as long as it turned off the RGB you'll be fine the game for at least two days but my surprising pick would be the oldest out of this bunch logitech g933 not exactly sure why large tech went ahead to replace the really good material that they've had there with something that is from a bathing suit on the newer models but here the sound quality is incredible for Wireless and like really powerful not punchy but like really tight bass really good detail you know treble not too harsh the microphone quality on here is actually the worst out of the bunch but as long as my teammates can understand me I'm fine and this is the only headset ever which I've actually enjoyed surround sound with but it's awesome and this would be like a really good dedicated gaming headset I definitely want to give SteelSeries a shout out with the Arctis 7 I think this is the better headset versus the Arctis Pro Wireless and if you guys want to see a complete head to head let me know in the comments below but this one sounds better to me and I don't really care so much about the the really big hub there with the interchangeable batteries so to me this would be a better value and it's significantly cheaper the only thing is Steelseries have updated the padding and the actual headband on the pro to be a little bit more comfortable versus the Arctis 7 now in terms of the razor stuff it's good to see they've changed the design of the thresher to be a little bit more distant from the Man O War so it's more durable but in terms of sound quality I feel like they went a little bit too much on the brightness like it's a really sharp headset so if you're into that definitely check them out in terms of the fit it's one of the better in this collection and the man o war surprisingly still sounds pretty good for being a 2016 release it's only the the frame itself is really bad and you can up online as to why the top headband just keeps breaking because the design is not exactly the best but the raiser section here you know if you want to maintain loyal then the Razer thresher would be my recommendation alright guys so that is it for this epic roundup let me know which one of these you would pick if you are on the market for a wireless gaming headset in the comments below as always make sure to subscribe and follow us on social media check out this other relevant content and also don't forget to let me know which one of these sounded the best in the microphone quality because to me the kind of all sounded a little bit the same with one of them a little bit poor I can't think with so many headsets on me guys I'm Dimitri thanks so much for watching

Sounds like a perfect time to upgrade to a wireless gaming headset. So today, we're taking a deep dive into five popular gaming headsets to see which one's worth your hard earned greenbacks. This is a purse Colin, this is a huge wallet. The GeForce RTX 2070 Tri Frozer offers a triple fan thermal design, eight gigs of GDDR6 memory, and memory speeds of up to 14 gigabit per second. Check it out at the link in the video description. (upbeat techno music) Let's start with SteelSeries and the Arctis 7. For about 120 bucks on Amazon, this is one of the more affordable headsets in the lineup today. Out of the box, it comes with your required charging and audio input cables, as well as a remote receiver pod to increase your wireless range, this thing. The range on these things is the best of any of the headphones we tested in our lineup. It made it way outside the building and nearly across the whole parking lot before dropping the signal. Not bad. On the back of this receiver, there is both a line in and a line out. You can use in for audio from a second source like your phone and out for your computer speakers, which will automatically turn off when you turn on your wireless headphones. So, no more messing with the playback device's menu. Huge win! Moving onto the listening experience, the Arctis 7's perform very okay. Although there's a noticeable drop-off at the upper and lower ends of the frequency range. Something that's easy enough to account for with the Steel Series Engine Software EQ. For gaming, the 7.1 virtualization is very good, with clear directionality to enemy movements in game, but as far chat is concerned, well, the microphone exists, but it's not gonna win any awards. It does feature a nifty retraction mechanism though. So that's nice I guess. The headband offers a lot of adjustment, but the pressure around the ears is a bit strong, particularly for longer sessions. Overall, the Arctis 7's didn't impress us too much, hot take. But they're definitely passable. Moving on. Feast your eyes on this, the Corsair Virtuoso Wireless RGB. RGB. They're pretty expensive but they got the looks to match. Check out the subtle RGB in the machine aluminium accents. The big ear cuffs are comfy and actually didn't end up getting too hot during use which is something that occasionally can be a problem with leatherette cups. There's also a fully removable microphone. A nice touch if you have a stand mounted microphone for streaming, for example. The range is reported to be 60 feet but our tests put it closer to 20-25 feet, which actually is the worst of the bunch but I am happy to see USB-C making an appearance here. In fact, you may have noticed USB-C making another appearance here at ""lttstore.com"". Okay, as for gaming, the Virtuoso RGB's have great imaging. This makes it super easy to focus in on targets you hear. However, the sound profile is all over the place. The bass drops off toward the end of the range, but is weirdly jacked up in the low mid-range. So it's really boomy out of the box. However, the Clear Chat EQ preset in the companion IQ software actually does a remarkable job of remedying this. And with some additional tweaking, we ended up really pleased with the headset as a whole. Good job Corsair. Maybe just throw a better tune on this thing out the box and yeah, happiness. Next up we have the most expensive headset in the lineup. The Astro A50. The big appeal with the A50's is the fancy wireless charging cradle/dock ordeal. Not only does it charging a snap, literally, there's also a huge array of IO on the back, including optical. But watch out because other than the micro-b charging port, there's no IO on the headset at all. So you cannot connect it to any other devices unless you use the dock. That applies to wireless or wired. Our A50s are PC and PS4 compatible and there's also a PC/Xbox version if that's your consol of choice. As for how they sound though, well look, they sound good, okay? Quite good actually. They have a nice, clear response through the entire range, particularly up top but they aren't actually the best sounding headset in this list in our opinion. And for the price these command, that's a major sin in my eyes anyway. This is really comfortable though. I really, really want to love them. They are really comfortable. They're easy to use day to day and the fact that there's an Xbox version is awesome. You don't always see that. By the way, we're working on a video where we check out all the different game streaming services that are coming out now, like GeForce Now, Project xCloud, and PS Now, so make sure you're subscribed so you don't miss out. But for gaming specifically, I'm gonna have to recommend my next set of headphones, incidentally from the parent company of Astro, Logitech. The Logitech G935's. Let's get one thing out of the way here first. The G935's from Logitech are not perfect. The creak a little on the twist and they're relatively big design may not be for everybody. So why is this our favorite headset of the bunch? Well they're priced incredibly well. They're comfortable with these big plush ear cups and they just sound fantastic. The 50 mm drivers make their presence known with a full and deep low range while still doing pretty well up top, with only a mild drop off in the very high end of the range and with a mild EQ tune up, they sound just stellar with music. When it comes to gaming however, make sure to use the profile switching feature to enable surround sound. The DTS codec and surround sound emulation do an incredible job imaging in-games. Just be aware the processing affects music to a degree that is noticeable but as long as you're actually using the automatic switching, you're good to go. The G-hub software gives you a ton of options for programming the three G buttons on the back of the headset for lighting, sound or IO presets and of course there's RGB. Even though, it's all on the back of the headset where it's not visible to your stream viewers or audience and if no one can see your RGB, does it really exist? Features like the tip-up microphone mute are great to see as are the hidden dongle cowdy and user replaceable battery. Finally, we have the HyperX Cloud Flight. Wow, are these headphones over amplified. The highs are way over modulated and so is the upper bass range with the noticeable dip in the mids and since the 270 megabyte software actually contains nothing useful, the only way to make these sound better was to install Equalizer APO, a free equalizer which actually got them to a totally reasonable level. Very listenable, that doesn't mean ill forgive the lack of effort HyperX put into the overall user and listening experience here though. For a measly $94 relative to all the other ones in the group, I can understand it but it feels like an incomplete product and our similarly priced other options here are just better buys. Podium time, our gold medal goes to these creaky Logitech G935's as the best value especially with a good EQ applied. Speaking of equalizers, if you click through to our forum post below, all of the custom equalizer tunes Colin did to these headphones for this video will be posted for you guys to try out and if you've never equalized your levels before, we say, give it a shot, you'll be impressed and it's not that hard. - What do you mean you don't have a website on Squarespace yet, it's easy, just go to the link in the video description, pick one of their award winning templates, add your own pictures and texts and boom, you're ready to stand out.

syncing as the passwords will autofill your credentials on mobile sites and apps for iOS and Android and of course the security and of course the convenience folks click on a link down in the video description for more info again thanks to LastPass for sponsored this portion of the video so folks let's get into the list number 5 this is for all the people on a budget the Samsung Galaxy buds I've tested a few months ago we're very good for the price especially if you can get these for about $100 even again I'll leave my links down in the description for the most updated prices now these are the smallest and lightest truly wireless earphones I've tested the Galaxy buds have up to six hours of better life which the industry is usually averaging around four to four and a half hours per charge and impaired in the connection for me Indies have been one of the fastest now Bluetooth 5.0 technology is offered and this is the latest version available as of this video with Bluetooth 5.0 you get stronger and further wireless signals with your phone now there's also wireless charging offered with the case and on the back of the case it's the newest and latest USB see connections basically future proofing yourself is a huge thing right now now there is some water protection it is low though I will omit that it has a IP 2 rating you're only protected from dripping water and up to a 15 degree angle from vertical if you're caught in the rain with these it might be a little scary but to be fair if you're not running in the rain with these it's like no big deal if you were one thing something more rugged keep watching this video the next one should be really good here but although the galaxy buds have bluetooth 5.0 getting back here if you're intending on watching videos with these for the most part they are in sync but on some few occasions there's about a millisecond delay there for those who don't know with some wireless devices you'll see the lips move on video but then you hear the audio later and I'll be mention is quite a bit in the following models as well now also as a side note Samsung does have transparency mode pastor or some people call it ambient aware the microphones turns on and lets you hear your environment so it's not just passive noise isolation perfect for safety and awareness around you but the Auto signature is good it's very much suitable for the $100 price range you're not getting sonic fidelity but if you're looking for a casual yet quality pair the Samsung Galaxy buds offers tons of value let's take it up a notch here let's look at number 4 all right number 4 are the j-bird run XTS I'm really digging these things j-bert had slightly redesigned these and they fit in the ears so much better than before now there's two flaws that I've seen here one it has bluetooth 4.1 or 4.2 if I recall and because so for video the lips the actors voices again is out of sync but if you're focused on working not necessarily watching videos these things are rugged as heck and it might suit your needs but before I get to that the second flaw here is there's no pass-through so you can't hear your environment while running for safety and awareness but the following features this could basically offset those flaws there this has an IP seven rating meaning this can be submerged underwater not many competitors even offers that second the audio signature is very loud and alive here and with the free downloadable app you get punchy base if you want to punch up the low frequencies here if you want Ford highs or bright mids you can do that as well these are very responsive to get it the way that you want now better life on these are average with four hours per use and an additional eight hours from the charging case for a total of twelve hours worth of performance on the perks that helps the run XTS get on this list there's also location assistance if these drop out of ear let's say while running you can use their app to find them there are other brands that offers this feature as well but it's rare and again the jaybird provides all those previously ever mentioned features and that's why I put them on a list as number four they're super rugged it stays in your ears very well that bass boost is sound signature with that in-your-face audio again folks I'll leave the links down in that video description but let's move on to number three here these are the Jabra elite 65 T's the J birds are indeed nice but the Jabra does offer slightly better audio performance it's airier it's wider it's simply cleaner there is an app that does allow Tooting as well it's not as responsive as Jaybirds but Jarvis starts off with such a clean foundation any tuning just tweaks it just build upon it the elite 65 T's is also one of the best fitting in ear performances here the J birds are good and do stay in but the elite 65 T's feels more stable at least with my ears here there's always trying to recommend the best for you these are also Bluetooth 5.0 that means it's a stronger more stable connection but with this Bluetooth 5.0 I didn't have any signal issues with video the better life is slightly above average with five hours per use with another 10 hours from the case for a total of 15 if you use these four phone calls the audio plays through both ears and it is super-clear for the other person listening but keep in mind it does pick up a little bit of background noise or actually picks up a lot of background noise so just be aware of that now the elite 65 T's offers an IP 5 rating for protection again jet sprays which again I think is enough for most people even at IP 4 rating is enough that it protects against water splashes now last there is here through which does allow you to pump in your environmental noises for safety and awareness and for being number 3 I think this is the best most well-rounded pair of truly wireless earphones out there but getting into the next two here I'll admit they are a little bit more expensive and honestly most people watching this video will probably buy either number five number four maybe B's right here those are already great but these next two just take it up again one more - alright so I know there are some folks who dislike Beats products I can see where you're coming from in my beats headphone review specifically the studio threes they weren't the best performance and they were charging a good bit as well but I have to give credit where credit is due and for the power beats Pro completely different product right here there's some features that is outstanding first and foremost this is the only major brand of truly wireless earphones that offers these ear hooks if you have slippage with other brands these ear hooks do work now I've noticed time and time again I've been reaching for the power beats pros over my other truly wireless earphones when I go to the gym specifically for the gym I use a different pair for everything else but talk about that pretty shortly here now when I lay down horizontally to benchpress who want to get on that treadmill and run for my life to the pulled days in the gym what have you the power beat pros stays on no questions asked now if you want peace of mind I'm telling you these or it and I think they look really darn good two seconds these have had the most consistent fastest and easiest pairing that I've experienced apples aged one ship that's inside offers that experience not only on Apple devices but also on Android it's about a one-second delay or one second slower on my pixel phone but still that consistency of taking out your earphones and then instantly pair into your phone every time with no issues it's that was considered the best from my experience not only that because of this h1 chip the better life on these it's possibly the best out there 9 hours will 9 hours of use plus 15 hours from the case for a total of 24 hours just the nine hours alone I wear them to the gym maybe forget that day to put them back into the case of recharge and use it the next day or tube and still have enough battery power to last I don't even think about it again intuitive peace of mind and practicality the numbers speak for themselves also testing this with video it works 100% fine with zero syncing delays we do have some water resistance and being upfront its equivalent to an IP four rating meaning they can only take on splashes they don't take on jet sprays like the IP 5 rating on the previous models and they can't be submerged like the IP 7 rating from jaybird but again ask yourself do you think you'll be exposed to jet sprays or drop us into the puddle your call but the one thing that I know that would impact everyone's the purchase decision here it's not a bad thing but some people like this these are not 100% passive noise isolating earphones with all the previous models on the list they go in your ear canal and creates a seal and that helps tremendously with audio immersion and it does black out the outside world kind of like we're in ear plugs then with the power beats pros you can hear your surroundings a bit somewhat some would like that for safety but again the other earphones do offer some sort of pass through or hear through connection that allows you to hear your environment as well yet you can always turn it off it's actually a feature on there now with that being said the audio quality is focused on based focused consumers it's deep it's rumbling it's gonna be loud and it is really nice though it is slightly niche Anish characteristic here that some would love but honestly and just being upfront some will actually hate because it's so bassy I didn't mind it from my workouts it sounds good to me but surely not great this is just me I prefer the refinement of the job rows a bit more even the Jaybirds punchy bass I did prefer that better or more so but everything else about these earphones they hit it out of the ballpark and because of its ease of use and practicality that's why I can see many average consumers apprec-- the functions over the audio performance the audio is not bad at all but the other practicality functions here just basically supersedes that it just adds on to the experience so before I go into the best truly royalty earphones Basel met number one there are indeed some honorable mentions these are not bad but they simply didn't work as well for me I love these things here the Bose sound support phrase offers an insane audio experience somehow bose tuned these things to offer audio that's interpreted from coming within your head it sounds as though the center channel is originating from inside and not from left and right audio channels it's insane and I still highly recommend for you to try them the only reason why I didn't place them on its list again this is just me you have to acknowledge they are huge also they're heavy and didn't stay in my ears as well as I wanted them to and I've seen some six-foot-two dudes with a bigger head and such and it looks fine with them but me no I just didn't look right also they have barely any passive noise isolation as well very similar to the Apple earpods even less noise isolation than the power beats pros meaning you can hear everything around you you should still test them if you can now since mentioning the air pods I personally haven't tested the new models but I am aware they don't offer passive noise isolation either that's what it might must have now I'm sure they're great I know their connection and better life is very good and for the price there's a lot of value with those two but again those just weren't for me now the bnot 8 version 2 sounds amazing but not as good as my number one they look great that she charging is awesome but for $350 retail you get average better life that's four hours plus 12 hours with the case in addition you can only use the right ear but if you take any one of those earphones off and Ally this still has bluetooth 4.2 instead of the newest bluetooth 5.0 and with my testing I was able to prove it was only able to cover half of my apartment here well the all the other earphones on this list so far was able to cover at least 80% in some a hundred percent of the of the apartment here without the single crackling or basically breaking that with the clips t5 s and the creative outliers I haven't tested them just yet if you're watching this in the future be sure to check back but just being transparent I haven't had a chance to squeeze those in before this video I've been delaying this video like crazy so with all that being said here who is the best here goes my number one pick for this year and it sounds freaking good it's the Sennheiser momentum truly Wireless I know it's expensive it retails for about three hundred and fifty dollars it is on sale for three hundred but freak man if you're looking for the best audio experience from a pair of truly wireless earphones these will put you in another dimension these are impeccable the bass resonates and it's so clean it immerses you deeper into the beats the warmth is heard in the vocals to mid range that's very clean and clear to the high notes that really sparkles but what makes this sound better than any other pair of truly wireless earphones it's the soundstage it's super wide there's much depth in the audio interpretation even the average listener /na audiophile can hear the audio separation to a great degree now there is an app to offer some tuning of the audio here and it does help not as robust as Jaybirds but again the starting foundation and these are very very strong defined tweaks helps supplement the experience now when I'm not at the gym and when I'm not using my headphones if I want minimalist around the office around the studio or walking outside to the grocery store over here to the bubble tea shops around here and the most important factor to me is the audio quality I use these basically this is what you also get Bluetooth 5.0 and with my testing both video on both Apple and Android devices it played perfectly in sync you have water resistance which is only at IP four which means it's only splash proof but again that's all I personally need you get USB type-c on the case here to feature proof these things are about 65 TS and Jabir's didn't have the latest connection that power B pros are on lightning and aside from my number 5 which with the Samsung Galaxy buds which were my budget models the B&amp;O were the only other ones on my list so far that had USB type-c you also have touch controls transparency mode and so you can use either earbud in your ear now the only thing that I didn't like is honestly the aren't as stable as the more dedicated Fitness earphones but again these like the binos and Eclipse t5 and such they don't offer ear wings or ear findt they don't offer the best stability but again it's fine because of everything else folks I love these Sennheiser truly Momentum's so folks down in that comment section below let me know what you think of this list so far I know not ever gonna agree with it that's perfectly fine none of these earphones aren't perfect and of course it still depends on how much you're willing to spend and of course what what you're gonna use it for but folks please comment down below like fire emojis of course and folks I'll catch you guys on the next one you guys take care bye [Music]

sound - battery life - waterproofing these are sturdy but light with an adjustable cable and they come with eight different pairs of gel tips so they should fit a variety of ears they do require a little bit of adjustment because they go over the ear and then you have to twist them in but once they're in there they're in there and they sound great they offer deep bass with crisp clear vocals my only complaint would be that sometimes they sounded a little bit bright so I'd end up turning the volume down like a lot of other Bluetooth headphones they pair with both iPhone and Android smartphones and they have a standard three button remote and mic attached to the cable they have a ridiculously long 12 hour battery life and they also come with an IP x5 waterproof rating now does this mean that you should go swimming with them no but I've been sweating in them and have spilled water on them from my water bottle and the tap and they're still fine these are perfect though the plastic earbuds themselves are actually pretty big and while I was able to find a comfortable fit eventually the sheer size of those might be an annoyance to some people now if you want to spend a little less money a close second or Plantronics backbeat fit bluetooth headphones what really sold me on these was comfort and convenience it just felt super comfortable to me they go over the ear like the jail abs for a more secure fit and this cables pretty thick but the best part about it is when you throw it in a bag it doesn't tangle the sound quality on these is pretty good it's not super bass heavy but there's enough for beat-driven workout songs also the earbuds are designed to let some noise into the ear canal which some people prefer when they're exercising outdoors and as an added bonus the backbeat fits come with a neoprene armband for your smartphone so why aren't these my topic well the main reason is that the remote control technology is built into the earbuds themselves it's not in a little remote that comes on the cable now in theory having interactive earbuds is not a bad idea but in this case with the Plantronics there's a learning curve and they're also kind of sensitive so every time I went to Goa just the ear buds of my ears I would end up accidentally skipping or pausing a song I just kept wishing that it had a simple three button remote on the cable like the J labs there are a lot of other Bluetooth sport headphones to choose from and like I said this is going to come down to personal sound and fit preferences for you but there are some other things to consider that might be deal-breakers first do you really want to spend 150 to 200 dollars on a pair of headphones that are basically going to get beat up it's kind of how I feel about the Beats powerbeats2 wireless headphones or the brand new j-bird freedom sport headphones they're both really nice and offer good sound but that's a lot of money to spend on sport headphones you'll also want to determine whether you can deal with neck buds while you're working out like the kind on JBL's reflect response Bluetooth sport headphones some people find is really comfortable I find them to be a little doing especially when I'm running there are also some sport headphones that require you to use a mobile app to experience the full benefits of headphones like Jabra sport pace or sport coach but personally last thing I want is to have to download another fitness app whether or not you want six hours of battery life or 12 a flexible cable or an unbending one interactive earbuds or a three button remote noise isolating buds or ambient noise and of course how well they actually fit you is really going to come down to you but you can't go wrong with jail abs epic -

it's all there plus you can easily fool people into thinking you have actual air pods if that's something that you wish to do of course without getting into too much detail there's actually very few ways you could tell them apart so I'm gonna put the challenge to you guys here's real Apple earpods NYX - the i-12 tws i'll let you try and guess in the comments which is which i should probably also mention as well that the Bluetooth connection was rock-solid with these two the battery life is actually awesome at around 3 to 4 hours playback in one sitting with 55 milliamp hour batteries in each earbud and up to 15 hours extra if the 500 milliamp hour case is fully charged - so if you're craving the airport experience on a tight budget and you're not too fussed about the sound quality or you're just not a massive fan of ear buds that sit in your ear canal then the i-12 tws are well worth considering next up are the rather futuristic looking Jay lamp Jay Bub's air at forty nine pounds or forty nine dollars and unlike the i-12 tws these ear buds definitely deliver across the board and so they should really for an extra twenty bucks they may be the second most expensive ear buds on this list but what gives these ear buds an edge over cheaper alternatives is that it has three different EQ settings so they are jlabbe signature which is basically a bass and vocal boost a balance setting and a bass boost setting this gives these ear buds so much more versatility when it comes to finding a sound profile that better suits your own personal tastes of course the sound quality is great across all three different EQ settings - battery life is pretty awesome here - with a 500 milliamp hour charging case along with four hours of non-stop playback from a single charge thanks to the 60 milli amp hour battery in each earbud the charging case is really nice and secure but it is a little bit on the bulky side so here's the big question are the EQ settings and decent battery life worth dropping say an extra 20 bucks over cheap alternatives for me EQ settings like bass boost give the Jay pubs an edge over similar earbuds with an otherwise a very similar sound quality so I say the extra 20 bucks are well worth considering but hot maybe hold off just yet because as you'll see in the rest of this video there's some very tempting alternatives for a lot less than 50 bucks so just wait and find out my third recommendation for the best budget true wireless earbuds are probably the best all-rounder in this video the sound Pete's true freeze or the duty of Zeus ace at 33 pounds or 33 dollars but wait why am i recommending two different ear buds at once well that's just because they're basically both just rebranded versions of the exact same earbuds I know it's very confusing but basically just by which everyone is cheaper at the time because they are literally the same product what's pretty mad though is that both of these earbuds don't sacrifice build quality or sound quality to reach that lower price point either the base on these is incredibly punching the mids and highs are well balanced and they're definitely on par with the J bubs in terms of sound quality - the EQ settings of course everything about these earbuds feels like a premium product to be honest of at least 100 bucks and that is no joke the physical button controls on each year but are brilliant they're super responsive to a light click and each earbud is actually smaller than the J bubs - unbelievably these earbuds now also have an eight hundred million power capacity charging case that's something crazy you like an extra 35 hours of listening on top of the three to four hours you'll get from a single charge the microphone for calls is crystal clear and the case itself is pretty light in compact - but 33 bucks these earbuds are just insane value for money and take pretty much every box you could possibly want out of true was earbuds on a budget it's because of these earbuds that I'm very reluctant to drop 200 bucks on premium true wireless earbuds next up are the anchor sound called Liberty air earbuds at 80 pounds or 80 US dollars whilst they're actually the most expensive on this list anchor are aiming to give you an airport like experience at half the price of actual air pods which is great and it sounds great but maybe it would be slightly more appealing at the i-12 tws 130 dollars just saying it but in all fairness the Liberty airs are a million times more of a polished product than the i-12 tws which is no surprise considering the anchor a brand that I recognize and I can always trust when it comes to tech the sound quality is a huge improvement over the i-12 tws though it isn't actually the best compared to say the sound piece true freeze or the duty Oz news ace I found that the Liberty airs surprisingly like a lot of bass and at this price point I'd expect clear margins of improvement over a $33 pair of earbuds but in every other way they just pushed the boundaries of build quality and functionality at this price point the touch controls are intuitive and easy to use to build quality isn't that far off actual air pods yes really and the battery life is great with a 55 an power battery in each earbud and a 500 milliamp hour charging case the microphone is also probably one of the best for voice calls out of any of the earbuds in this list but it's still a hard sell if the Liberty Ayres were a little bit more affordable they'd probably be my personal favorites as I find that they fit my ear much better than the J buds or sound peep style design they're secure comfortable and it's easy to forget they're even there at a lower price point I kind of be able to forgive the sound quality a little bit more but I'm afraid for 80 bucks I'm just expecting better than average sound quality last but by no means least are a very familiar looking pair of ear buds the sound Pete's Q thirty twos at forty pound or 40 US dollars it doesn't appear to be an equivalent duty or Zeus equivalent at the moment but as soon as one emerges I'll keep the links in the description updated accordingly but why am i showing you what looks like the exact same ear buds again at seven bucks extra well yeah they're the exact same ear buds but it's it's the case here that gets a pretty sick upgrade the regular sound Pete's true free ear buds ship with an 800 milliamp power case which is pretty crazy but the Q 32 2600 milliamp power case that's a mind-blowing 55 hour playtime if your case is fully charged at least and for seven bucks extra I mean it's crazy how the world's off-budget true wireless earbuds has become so awesome for so little granted it makes the case pretty chunky but let's be real if you do go on super long journeys we're charging isn't always possible or you just always forget to charge to them and they constantly fly and you can't use them just take the chunkier case on the chin pay the seven bucks and be done with it you won't regret it you'll find it very useful as I'm more of a casual earbud user I'm sticking with the true free 800,000,000 power case because that's still a heck of a lot of charging power and I appreciate the case of slimmer profile for when I just want to shove it in my pocket but still I love these earbuds overall so much they had to throw in this minor upgrade which makes a big difference in terms of battery life so that's it for the five best true wireless earbuds did I miss any out have you tried any of the earbuds in this video how they what are you gonna buy after watching this video let me know if I leaving a comment below I spent ages researching all these different earbuds so I really hope it helps you out all five of them are great so you can't really go wrong with whatever you pick but if you do have say any specific questions about any of the earbuds I mention in this video then feel free to ask away in the comments please give this video a thumbs up if it helped you and make sure you subscribe for tons more tech reviews and roundups just like this one or you'll probably never hear my Simon Cowell Star Wars ever again basically a lot of you have been saying that I sound like it recently so just try to go with it in the comments section of today I'm asking your thoughts on the endangered-species known as the headphone jack do you have one on your smartphone you do you still use it if you don't have one do you miss it let me know your thoughts in the comments below so before you go one last thing don't forget to give me a follow up here on Instagram if you like seeing crazy psychedelic photos of London or you just want a heads up when my next videos gonna go live check out my story for that anyway guys that's all from me and until next time mark over and out"

cult favorite that then became one of the bestsellers one of the most popular headphones on all of Amazon okay fine so it's a great headphone it's a popular headphone why are you talking about it right now Lou what's happening what has developed something very exciting in fact so many of you have gone out and bought this headphone but you've been stuck you're sitting at home with the wired connection or you have the wire heading out from this port here to your mobile device or wherever it is that your audio source lives but today I got this product over here from a company called East Brooklyn labs the be Al - m50x this is a Bluetooth adapter specifically for the m50x this little guy will plug in to where your cord normally would plug in and you will pair up to the adapter it's modular it's beautiful now this isn't the first solution I have found for taking a wired headphone and making it Wireless there in fact other ways to do that as well from various brands so here's an adapter from a company called air mod and they're focusing on the Bose products so the qc25 in the QC 15 here are a couple products to turn those headphones into Wireless and they fit in there perfectly as well and then we've got this company here EXO audio they make similar adapters but for Beats headphones so here's one for the bead studio up here's one for the beats solo2 and then the last one is this one here it's called air link now to me these are the two most exciting why because I've got some m50x already and because the air link takes any headphone and makes it Wireless so this little guy this little module would you look at that how pretty is that little thing so this will clip on to your shirt your sweater pocket coat something like that and not only does it give you control over volume your microphone for answering phone calls and even what looks like a shutter button for a camera right there this Clips here the earpods go up and into your ears and now you're not tethered to your pocket now I know before you say it I know what you want to say you want to say but that's not actually Wireless because there's a wire going to this module but it is a more convenient than having the wire go all the way down to the pocket so with a product like this you're able to shorten the distance from the cord to your ears okay so that's cool the air link the other adapters that I mentioned earlier exciting stuff if you have one of those pairs of headphones or if you want the universal one but the one that I'm most pumped up for is this one here from East Brooklyn labs because like I said the iconic m50x now gets the Bluetooth treatment it now turns into a bluetooth headphone and best of both worlds here you can still use it with a wire if you want to so let's crack this open see what it's all about so it has a similar shape to those beats adapters that I showed you earlier also in the package is a tiny little micro USB cable to keep this thing charged up and then the adapter itself it's got a matte finish on it which I like so it shouldn't get too many fingerprints your power switch is over here and let's see how it fits in so this is the design of the m50x if you've never seen it it has this channel which moves down a little bit oh you might be wondering as well Lou what's up with your m50x why you have the cool color on there so this is a D brand skin actually allowing you to customize the look of the m50x I told you it's that popular they even made a skin for this how many people have this headphone and worth mentioning before I insert this the m50x doesn't allow for a 3.5 millimeter connection on the headphone side it's actually smaller it's 2.5 millimeter right there okay so let's go ahead and check out this fit here ooh I like that so the way that they've built this this is cool design here this section of the headphone sinks into this section of the adapter right here so it doesn't hang down too low it's not it's not much of an obstruction at all in fact it only increases the length of the ear cup by not even half an inch and that's what it looks like when you're wearing it so well here I mean it's really not a big deal it has hardly any weight to it and all of a sudden my favorite headphones are now Wireless I mean that's cool so there you can see see that little blue light it might be tough to see because it's lit up in here but the blue light starts flashing immediately when you have the power switch flipped on I mentioned that this charges up over microUSB and then on the front you have your controls the Bluetooth button volume up and down I think it's impairing mode and immediately though because it is flashing blue right now see that there so let's check if it's available m50x bao m50x now I'm gonna put these on and let's see how this sounds through the adapter so as far as the button in the middle goes I think you might hold it to reestablish a Bluetooth connection but if you tap it it pauses what you're listening to so you could have a conversation and tap it again and then it picks up again they've done a serious job here I am beyond impressed that is a package the m50x is already a great headphone one of the minor drawbacks you can't use it wirelessly now you can without giving up the wired capabilities the sound quality though is probably the most impressive part lots of juice which I didn't expect on a large / ear headphone and just overall punchy it sounds good I would recommend this if you have an m50x or you're thinking of getting an m50x this is probably the best companion piece that you could add to it I'll link it down below in the description they've done a great job just remember this isn't your only Avenue as I mentioned earlier in the video there are solutions to essentially turn any wired headphone into a wireless headphone including earbuds and so on with the universal adapter I showed you called the air link and then of course separate products for the beats headphones and the Bose headphones I just think this is probably my favorite of the bunch so check these guys out oh and also worth mentioning the company that makes this adapt their East Brooklyn labs they're claiming a 5 hour runtime so 5 hours of listening on a single charge and I also just noticed not only is it available on Amazon but you can get it bundled so you get the headphones and the adapter all in one package either way I'll link it down below you

Jack isn't it isn't it what's up guys Lew here back with another video and today we've got some headphones you guys know that I love headphones these ones are special they've been looking for so long for the perfect set of wireless headphones to have at my desk for convenience bars wireless headphones go these are some of the best that exists as far as I know because they use uncompressed wireless digital frequency response transmission that sounds pretty complicated there's no compression that's applied to the sound like in bluetooth it's using its own RF frequency so essentially the idea here is the highest quality sound without wires it also has this really cool base station that charges the headphones giving them up to 18 hours of battery life these are one of the reasons that I've been holding off on episode 3 of my desk tour because I wanted to make sure these got on that desk before I did it they're not cheap then again a lot of things here on unbox therapy aren't but as many things in life follow this rule you get what you pay for right right Jack alright pop these babies open accessories the actual RS 185 oh yes nice and light surprisingly light when it comes to fit on a pair of headphones it's as important in my opinion is sound where's my phone going off hello hey I'm in the middle of making a video like actually recording right now you I think you just made it in the video yeah yeah you're a big star now okay say hi to the world real quick I'm gonna put you on speaker really you do okay but this is the base station this can sit on your desk look at that essentially act not only as a charging stand but a stand for your headphone so here we can display them charge them at the same time as well as have all of our controls so we have volume on the front a level button for alc or MLC and then at the top there is a battery indicator on the back here is all of your i/o you have a digital optical in so yes this can take a digital signal and then you have an analog one if you're going low-tech old-school not that there's a problem with that and then a power as well and here is your selector for whichever audio input you're using on the top is the charging section those little pins will charge up your headphones and that pretty much rounds out the transmitter the accessories some paperwork when I was young I used to go to bed with the manuals from the latest gadgets that I had purchased and when I say go to bed I mean go to bed okay think about that a bunch of powered app there's North America Europe somebody told me what this one was recently New Zealand Australia AJ perfect booyah ready for power so here we have an RCA style cable for an analogue input an optical cable for digital audio and batteries so there's a couple of little tabs here telling me to twist the ear pad and that exposes the battery section one battery two batteries Vellore style or microfiber style ear cups super comfy for me they don't get as hot on the side here is where you're going to control everything here you can see you can control level left and right and volume as well now these are an open back style Sennheiser does make closed back wireless headphones as well okay so now I have these hooked up to an audio source you're probably going to have these in an entertainment unit or hooked up to your computer permanently now I noticed a couple things on the front here this level button controls the ALC or MLC so that's the automatic level control or manual then you have a knob here for controlling the input level so let's go ahead and start up some music so you don't want to overload this manual control so if I go to automatic level control so it sort of finds the right level and then I suppose you're going to control the volume here on the headphones so the the ALC is working perfectly right now it's not clipping at all as you can tell sound is bleeding here like crazy but that's the intent with an open back design if you're concerned with like disturbing people in your directive vicinity if people are sitting in the same room as you like in an office type environment that might be an issue but if you're in an office where people can't get down with instrumentals like this you probably don't want to be there anyways I'm going to turn it up now so if you overload the manual control you'll actually get a red light indicator so that's really cool so you can kind of fine tune it okay so we're working with plenty of volume there plenty you can really blast these things if you want to I'm gonna go ahead and try them with a number of different sources and if you guys have any more questions about them I will be using them on the daily so hit me up on Twitter I'm at unbox therapy you can ask me questions there so far very comfy and the sound is well impressive once again if you're interested in pricing and availability the links will be down in the description these are about to find a new home on my desk and they gonna look pretty damn pretty over there if you enjoyed this content make sure to leave a thumbs up down below thanks as always for watching and I'll catch you on the next episode later you're probably so cool that you listen to bands that don't even exist yet that's as cool as it gets

no we are you annoyed by the cable on your gaming headset sometimes the cable is positioned on either side the here cup which makes placement of your PC annoying in your space many headsets also exhibit cable noise as when it's brushing against your shirt you can clearly hear that in your ear cups which is annoying of course cable management is a thing on how you can actually route it in your space and some headphones even have the dual wire coming out of each ear cup which is not that pleasant when you're trying to take them off and it just becomes you know you have to deal with the wire any way you slice it unless you've got a wireless pair that gives you that convenience or freedom of movement not worrying about the cable around your body you still have to position something around your computers for the wireless receiver for the headset but how does the artists 7 play out in this whole Wireless Arena let's check it out right after this hi I'm looking for a case well look no further I got this beauty the H 700 I buy NZXT with all steel premium frame with a side of tempered glass - beautifully showcase any cooling adventure you might pursue and came a management system that you wish you had earlier all this lit up with integrated RGB lighting and built-in fan control the aged 700 I this one's for you oh I'll take it alright so the arcus 7 from a feature standpoint is one of the best wireless headsets around that this priced inline with competition from Logitech and Razer although the new Void pro from Corsair is 50 bucks cheaper so if the lack of cable is a priority for you that is an option you can check out the full view right here as expected the entire arc this family is diverse from standard analog pairs to bluetooth to USB RGB headsets and it's a really nice surprise to not see RGB on this wireless pair to preserve battery life the overall structure is fine with plastic ear cups with pleasant rubber coating the top headband is metal unlike the plastic construction on all other arctas pairs the swivel joints are a little bit too loose for my taste but notice there is no creaking so that's awesome the self adjusting fabric is swappable and stretches a little bit and it's a cool customization element definitely more unique than RGB lighting and the earcup cushions are nice to the touch with a soft Center but I find them not thick enough to compensate for the convex plastic housing of the driver that I can feel with my ears so the arcus 7 is slightly heavier than the non-wireless arctas 5 in Arcis 3 because there is a battery in here and our other wireless components but unfortunately SteelSeries have not done any structural changes to accommodate for better comfort I find this all-in-one fits all type of headband that stretches based on your head size not ideal because I'd say I have a medium-sized head with a lot of hair so I'm already touching the bottom of that metal headband which has very little padding this will be an issue for people with larger heads because we do have width adjustment which is fine but not much height adjustment and therefore even though the clamping force is nicely balanced for example I can feel the top of the headband but the headset is being sort of supported by the ear cups on each side and because we cannot extend the headband leaving the headset around your neck is uncomfortably tight it's just better to take them off when not in use the microphone is retractable that has less than usual flexibility so it stays in one position every time you pull it out it is always on unless muted with a switch at the back that you can easily find and the red LED is easy to notice when it's muted don't believe all the marketing hype that you see especially with SteelSeries claiming this is the best microphone in gaming so it's clear and it's detailed it's got some nasally elements to it in terms of Brac on compression right now I'm typing on an MX blue keyboard which is right below me and you can still pick up those keystrokes although they are muted but in terms of comparing this microphone to other mics it's clear and it's not as nasally as the Void Pro Wireless and what you're hearing now is the coarser void Pro Wireless so this one is a bit quieter it's not as detailed it doesn't have as much of a lower end bass pickup and I think this one sounds a bit more nasally and what you'll listen to now is the Sun Heiser game one my far my favorite gaming headset microphone it's rich it's detailed and you guys can compare to what it sounds like you know wired versus Wireless in this price range there are many controls on the headset starting with the power button then a dial for chat mix that lets you balance your voice comms or in-game volume with a tactile middle bump the battery indicator is the blinking color of the power button or the 4-bar battery icon in the software and I think just a simple percentage of the battery number would have been better on the other side is the mic mute a smooth volume dial from zero to a hundred a USB mini-b eight pin cable and a 3.5 millimeter input for audio sharing and the micro USB for charging so this micro USB port is only for charging and firmware updates it does not work without the wireless receiver but you can plug in the USB mini-b Aitken cable that ends with a 4-pole 3.5 millimeter jack so the headset can be used with mobile devices or a controller without the need to power it on now the wireless receiver is a bit different than usual it's a compact hub with the white LED at the front if solid the connection is fine and if blinking the headset is either sleeping or disconnected there's a pair button on the side and on the back there's the line in and out which is pretty cool because you can route your speaker's into the hub and have it automatically switch between the headset if it's on or the speaker's if the headset is off and put the line in you can connect whatever source that has a 3.5 millimeter output into the hub that will then wirelessly transmit audio into your headsets for for example if you want to play audio from your smart phone from the hub or like Nintendo switch that does not support USB audio but you can route that analog signal into the hub that will then go here or maybe from TV so that you get that Wireless convenience without having to actually connect the headset directly into your source now I was actually quite surprised with a plug-and-play setup process I already have the Engine 3 installed on my computer and that recognizes the headset immediately but both the firmware and additional drivers have to be downloaded which is automatic for it to work properly now I normally never touch anything in the settings but I do like to hear the mic side tone so I put that on high and some EQ adjustments are always nice for a competitive game play the dynamic range compression is unnecessary and just sounds horrible if you want to hear everything on a uniform decibel level just use the volume wheel to adjust your volume and as far as the surround sound experience with DTS X as usual it's quite bad it expands the soundstage but you lose directional cues that they're otherwise audible and stare and many important audio elements are now muffled so the only advantage with surround sound on is a slightly larger immersion of you audio environment as with stereo things are a bit closer to you and closed off in this headset but the stereo mode is actually quite nice with lots of detail on the high end I prefer a brighter sound signature for competitive gameplay because you pick up all the trouble and all the little things that make you aware of your surroundings and where things are coming from the mid-range is great and the bass is weak which I actually prefer for a competitor gameplay and the wireless signal is actually quite impressive not only in the range Department I got about six meters with a few walls in between without losing signal but in terms of clarity and not hearing any distortions or any background hiss or noise and stuff like that it's completely fine very good signal in the wireless department so it's actually quite nice if you like to listen to music podcast or whatever else while being mobile around your house that's for battery life it's nothing about standing still series claims 24 hours of listening time I got about 20 hours of continuous use before the red blinking LED start to go off and the convenience of microUSB for charging is good because many mobile devices utilize micro USB so charging this thing should not be an issue I still wish that we have the percentage of battery left in a software so that you could be a little bit more clear on how much is left and the headset does shut off by itself to preserve battery life when not in use but unfortunately I found that I have to power it on manually every morning after the computer has been shut down and I wish that it would automatically get that connection through the hub when it's on and power on the headset as well so that I don't have to manually do it every single morning and so the arctas 7 is fully loaded from a feature standpoint as far as wireless headsets go this is not the best mic in gaming but it's pretty fantastic with awesome stereo drivers but I wish the headband structure was taller for extra comfort I wish the dials in the back were not as loose because anytime I put the headset on off I constantly switched something either the volume or the chat mix and I wish that the connection between the headset and the hub was a bit more automatic and pick up the signal right away when the the hub is on so I don't have to do it manually all the time now the main thing here is that Wireless convenience which is incredible but this thing will not be replacing my game one just yet but if you are building this whole wireless set of gaming peripherals then perhaps consider the Ark the 7k so

them it's don't really look like much man that power button takes a long time do you hear that power on sound it sounds like scratchy ridiculous this does not look promising sound [ __ ] awesome this video is brought to you guys by huni huni is the free web browser extension that will help you find the best promo codes on shopping websites like Amazon eBay and more get it today join honey calm /l tt to understand this product I feel like we have to go back in time a little bit mass drop now drop comm partnered with thx on a desktop headphone amplifier back in 2018 and they got extraordinarily positive reviews with people calling it the last amplifier you'll ever need and I'm not talking just the audiophile community that buys snake oil $200 cables I'm talking the analytical ones like a mere m the founder of audio science review and the special sauce was apparently in the THX a chromatic audio amplifier or triple-a achromatic is basically a $10 word that means lacking in color so the name means that the amplifier was designed to not color the sound like for example a tube amplifier would which would give your music like a warmer sound basically whatever goes in is exactly the same as what comes out just louder thing is that amp would have been too power hungry for a portable device that's battery powered like this one so we're actually looking at a new member of the family today the mobile optimized thx triple 8-0 the physical design of the headphones is outstanding but only in the sense that it's trying so hard not to stand out like honestly these remind me more of like a reference design that might be created by a technology company to demo it to new partners who are going to run out and create their own designs I think they ended up with something that's a little bit too plain for the Zoomers out there but there's also an old excuse me more mature audience that might prefer this kind of a black everywhere look beer cups really comfortable I found the clamping pressure was a nice middle ground between ones that kind of grab onto your head like a vise taking all the pressure off the headband and ones that rely on the headband to support them and they just kind of float over your ears the i/o and buttons are really simple so you've got this four-way rocker joystick here that handles volume up and down track skip this way and then start and stop just by pressing and then you hold it for actually really long five seconds in order to get them to power up or power off it charges via USB see in terms of battery life I ended up getting about five hours of playback and I dropped 20% of the battery in the short time that I've had these and then microphone wise you've got a couple of microphones built into the right ear Cup with noise cancellation I mean they don't sound amazing to me but they're definitely serviceable on the left ear cup you get a whole lot of not much so it's a three and a half millimeter jack that serves two purposes there's an add-on boom microphone if you want a game on these I can't speak to how well that works I don't have it and then you can also just plug a three-and-a-half millimeter cable into your device if you're still using something with a three-and-a-half millimeter jack on it now to me the amplified sound that is when you're running off batteries wirelessly and the wired sound were exactly the same and I was half expecting the Golden Ears out there to tell me that I was flat out wrong but then actually read a blog post from drop com later where they confirmed that that was something that they actually tuned these for so that's pretty nice one complaint I have here is the headband the adjustments are pretty granular they've got a nice satisfying click to them but there's not a lot of adjustability in it and the headband itself has almost no padding on it whatsoever so they're just kind of relying on that clamping force and I did find that unless I was wearing it at exactly the right spot so that it sits flat on my head like I prefer to have my headphones a little bit farther back and I found it kind of Duggan wasn't as comfortable as it could be this is something that I wish they'd fix in a v2 with just a little bit of cushion because everything else about these is kind of incredible no matter what kind of music I throw at them whether it's the soundstage and stereo separation which is outstanding the the bass response it's like oh man I hate to say that they're super analytical and flat because they're not like when the song calls for it they punch really hard but you get no muddiness whatsoever and one of the other issues that I tend to run into with more you know reference or you know analytical flat sounding audio products is that I can find them quite fatiguing I find really sparkly highs are hard on my ears after it even as little as 10 or 15 minutes but with these I am comfortable saying that these are gonna be the most audiophile pleasing wireless headphones out there and not just compared to your consumer brands like your skull candy or whatever else I'm talking compared to someone like a sennheiser who I feel has over the years made a lot of compromises to their wireless products in order to be more of a lifestyle brand rather than being true to their pure audiophile roots this is just no compromise of course that's my initial impressions I would be remiss if I didn't actually compare them to other products they're gonna be competing with in the marketplace so what I've got here is the Bose QuietComfort 35 twos as well as a pair of Sony's WH 1000 XM threes these are both very well-regarded wireless headphones but ones that take as we're gonna see a very different philosophical approach to their design man I can't even I can't even talk while I'm listening these they're like so sound isolating too which is weird because they don't have any active noise-cancelling whatsoever after trying the abyss headphones honestly I didn't expect to be surprised like that again by a headphone at least not this soon but at the price these are at with Wireless this is incredible you really should try them like anyway let's let's get these other headphones paired up here I'm gonna start with the QC 35 - since they came away the clear winners in our last roundup immediately the active noise cancellation is nice but actually Brandon can you just kind of talk at me for a sec yeah okay shockingly especially for discrete sort of sudden noises like a person talking they don't actually block that much more sound though I would expect them to do a lot better for like a constant drone like the rumble of an aircraft the Bose sound is still good and it's still to my liking I like the tuning on the QC 35 twos but it has kind of like a a hollowness and it's not not even close there's a lot of muddiness in the base that's masking other details that you'd otherwise be able to hear on something more analytical and when you go loud they're messy I mean you should never be listening that loud but the truth is some people do and if you do they don't hold up let's try this on these NFC pairing is pretty neat hey Brandon I was just I just wanted to hear how much I could hear you a little bit less hiss a little bit less of the pressure feeling than both as the volume goes up the bass gets really loose one thing you're always gonna have to deal with with active noise-cancelling though is there's kind of like this baseline kind of something even if it's not quite noise like that pressure Sony and both though do a fairly excellent job of minimizing it after listening to the Sony's for a while longer I'm having a hard time remembering what I liked so much about the QC 35 is to be honest with you let's go back to the pandas man that power on sound is cheesy Oh I'm even more impressed like by a long shot I'm Way more impressed now than I was even when I first put them on sorry hold on hold on hold on let me turn this up okay go ahead they are they are actually so much better now with fresh context that I feel like I wasn't positive enough in the earlier part of the video so I guess this is the part where we talk about the tech that they built into these then so they're using drops planar ribbon drivers that are derived from the Oppo digital's PM series they're using the QC 5125 bluetooth chipset that has support for LD ace although it should be noted that you'll need to manually enable this higher quality mode on your device and frankly speaking I didn't hear much of a difference coming from app decks so your mileage may vary there but this is a big deal to me there's no DSP in these things whatsoever so you can't set them to auditorium mode or anything like that but they sound absolutely great without any digital tinkering and if you really like that stuff there's apps that you can get for your phone to do it with all that set the real test for me believe it or not is against the air pods Pro that's my daily driver right now and I know that the air pods pros have a lot of compromises they're not a perfect experience on Android they are not by any means the best sounding earphones on the market but the form factor they can literally fit with their entire charging case inside one of these plush ear cups here there is something to be said for that I love these things these have been a game changer for me I actually even sleep with them in because the active noise-cancelling helps me fall asleep all right they already sound like hollow and empty that really is kind of air pods in a nutshell isn't it you don't know what you're missing because that's all you've ever known realistically I'm still gonna daily drive these I'm just gonna be a lot more disappointed in them moving forward but I also want to clarify that these aren't gonna be for everybody because up until this point wireless headphones have really differentiated based on features as opposed to just audio quality like I remember the parrot zieks with their touch sensitive swiping controls and there's Microsoft but their fancy dial and you know there's well Sony in Bose with their built-in assistant buttons and they're you know active noise-cancelling all that kind of stuff but by contrast these are four hundred US dollars they have no phone app no touch sensitive buttons no active noise-cancelling no transparency mode so they actually lack a lot of the modern creature comforts that we've come to expect you know no there isn't even a digital assistant summon button and this was something that I forgot I even cared about but they don't automatically pause when I take them off they just keep playing around my neck it's like oh oh yeah that was the thing a long time ago but I think from a certain point of view that's the point of these things they're as close to the experience of wired headphones as you can get in terms of the sound quality in terms of just not having a bunch of digital crap in them other than the amplifier that they need and I like I really like them now one thing I want to address is that master op is sorry excuse me drop com a regular sponsor of ours but the only reason I checked these out was because I was genuinely interested in them and they did not sponsor any aspect of this video whatsoever who did though how do you like that Segway is ring so thanks to ring for sponsoring today's video ring is on a mission to make neighborhoods safer you can create custom affordable security with their smart home cameras and doorbells and personally for me it's all about the creature comforts keeping the delivery driver around a little bit longer telling the neighbor kid hey its unlock just come on in the kids are playing in the back room or whatever and not having to actually go to the front door is freaking sick the ring welcome kit includes the video doorbell - and chime Pro the video doorbell - has a motion sensing camera with adjustable range it's 1080p it's got 160 degrees of vision and it's got two-way audio built-in it's battery or eight to 24 volt AC doorbell wiring powered so you don't have to worry about you know just having being stuck with just one option and the time pro not only lets you know when someone pushes your doorbell of a nice loud ring it extends your Wi-Fi signal - which is useful for getting Wi-Fi to all of your smart home devices and also just extending your range and having fewer dead zones so get some peace of mind with the ring Welcome kit it's compatible with iOS Android Mac and Windows check it out at ring comm slash LTT we're gonna have that linked below wireless headphones for people who actually care about audio quality who'd have thunk it right you gotta try them like you got to try these I think these are a game changer

10:22:44.971093, who makes the best premium wireless active noise-cancelling headphones for your premium dollar bows or Sennheiser let's find out shall we intel skull Canyon Nook features a 6th generation Core i7 processor and Thunderbolt 3 you can learn more at the link in the video description ok so there's a lot to cover here we're going to jump right into this both headphones fold in to an included carrying case but Bose wins quite decisively here the QC 35 s case is both smaller and more durable feeling than Sennheiser's offering onto the contents being headphones and ones designed to fit on the heads of humans the QC 35 and px II 550 are pretty darn similar in many respects headband ear cups laser-guided artillery launcher etc so I'll try and dial in mostly then on the differences here boses Alcantara covered headband features noticeably better padding devoid of internal bumps that can dig into your head eventually but they're sizing adjustment mechanism fits perfectly on my medium motorcycle helmet sized head at its smallest size and feels more plasticky compared to Sennheiser's both of them offer about three and a half centimeters of total adjustment though so if your head is on the smaller side I expect you'll get a better fit out of the pxc 550 the ear cups themselves aside from both being closed back designs with faux leather covered memory foam for optimal noise isolation are about as different as they could be Bose has gone with a more traditional oval shape for the cups and angled drivers inside to direct sound into your ear canals while Sennheiser has done a couple of more unusual things here so the transducer has this grille over the top of it that looks kind of like an apple slicer perhaps there's a noise isolation or other acoustic reason for this and they've gone with a more ear like shape that fits well but in my opinion along with the boring black color choice makes the PXE 550 look considerably less stylish though some will find sex appeal in the user interface I suppose both headphones thankfully have the ability to operate with a wire if you're out of battery or even with active noise cancellation enabled with a wire if you just don't want to use the wireless to make it last longer but inexplicably they both rely on a two and a half mil two three and a half millimeter cable so order an extra or two now in case you lose the included one since you probably don't have a ton of those lying around with that said Wireless is sort of the point here isn't it so let's move on to that both of them will pair with an Android phone using NFC but while Bose has stuck with a traditional button based interface power on pairing mode here with volume adjustments and a multi-function button that handles media playback and phone calls over here sennheiser is using a fancy touchpad on the right ear cup that allows play and pause track skipping and volume adjustments with gestures fancy though it does still have some hardware buttons one to toggle the Bluetooth radio for battery savings during wired operation with noise canceling enabled one for toggling movie and speech optimized EQ profiles and a three-position slider that lets you pick 0 active noise cancellation fully enabled active noise cancellation with the four included microphones or an adaptive mode that adjusts the level of noise cancellation depending on ambient noise levels conspicuously absent though is a power switch with Sennheiser opting to build it into the hinge a design choice that I personally do not prefer let's get back to noise cancellation though the QC 35 specs are less impressive looking than the PX e5 50s and I really like Sennheiser's easy access to mix and match combinations of Bluetooth noise cancellation and wired or wireless interfaces but boses ANC is noticeably better in the real world this is particularly true of unpredictable sound like nearby conversation both of our competitors will cover consistent background noise like the low rumble of an engine almost completely at even a quite moderate listening volume like two to three bars on an iPhone and both of them managed to avoid that traditional problem with a and C products of a painful pressure sensation on the eardrums so thumbs up there the with that said a pair of construction ear protectors with a white noise generator inside would probably do the trick if all you wanted was to ignore the crying kid in the seat behind you how do they sad well there's no doubt in my mind on this one if you're an audiophile the pxc 550 is the better choice BOCES sound signature as much less veiled running off of a cable with the active noise cancellation disabled but while both products are operating as intended wirelessly with a and C and it should be noted with Bose you cannot turn the anc off if it's powered and running wirelessly the QC 35 s have a very one-dimensional sound to their bass reproduction and such strongly veiled mids that I found it hard to enjoy my favorite vocalists to be clear the pxc 550 s aren't exactly on par with Sennheiser's open backed audiophile products but they're well balanced with tight punchy bass fun vocals and the good ol sennheiser veil on the high-end that made them less fatiguing to listen to for long periods at least that would be entirely true if the PXE 550's were as comfortable as the QC 35 s I have got to give Bose though this is a narrow victory to be very clear here the nod when it comes to long-term comfort both of them are lightweight and stay in place very well but putting on Bose is offering it feels like your head is getting a hug from a friend while Sennheiser needs another few millimeters of padding on the headband to draw even here which isn't to say then that the back and forth trading of winds here is over bluetooth time Sennheiser only manages to identify your devices by numbers like phone one connected while Bose manages to inform me that it's connected to Linus's iPhone when I turn it on with that said I can probably accept remembering which of my devices is phone one connected for the sake of superior range while I was working on writing this I had to run downstairs to hit the bathroom and I left my phone on my desk and it wasn't until I'd been in there for but law actually okay never mind how long I was in there but the point is the PXE 550 s never missed a beat while my attempt to repeat my test with the QC 35 resulted in stuttering the moment I closed the door on to battery life then I'm going to call this one a win for Bose though it is a very narrow victory partly because Bose advertises about 20 hours of battery life and delivered 24 and Sennheiser puts 30 hours on their website though that's based on a more ideal operating scenario and running more apples to apples against Bose it actually ended up being very similar but both of them can handle a full day of music playback without recharging the battery which is damn impressive so who is the winner then this is not an easy question to answer today Sennheiser is charging more and offering up more consistent Bluetooth connectivity and superior sound quality while bose boasts boasts better noise cancellation a better carrying case and a more comfortable design at a lower price there so I know this is a bit of a cop-out but frankly the conclusion is this you'd have a very hard time going wrong with either of these so go ahead and flip a coin I am sure that you will be happy with your new wireless headphones and you know what else you'd have a hard time going wrong with tunneled air tunnel beerus the simple VPN app that makes it easy to browse privately and enjoy a more open Internet you download tunnel bear you started up with 500 Meg's of data for free with no credit card required you press the switch and that's it your bear tunnels your Internet through a different country up to 20 different countries I think it is

hey everyone I didn't know truly wireless earphones were gonna be a main focus this year but Bose Sony and Jaybirds in the past several months have released theirs and also in the past I've tested the jarba support elites and also the Apple earpods now as for the Samsung icon acts 2018 Edition I know you guys have been asking about that those are coming soon to the channel so be sure to subscribe to get notified well Megan Thompson also released their own with the Bo play e8 as always being transparent with you guys I personally pay for these at the very expensive retail price of $300 but testing the Vino h6 headphones and the a1 bluetooth speaker in the past they've been amazing products we'll see how this one goes and see if the price is justified as always I'll place my affiliate links down in that video description below click those links for the most updated prices in real time you never know when these things like the one sale so without further ado I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room I'm here to help you make a purchase decision welcome everyone to another review Bang &amp; Olufsen has always made some very nice products offering understated elegance in my personal opinion the model that you see on screen is called charcoal sand well there's a more stealthy option coming in black now they're made of mostly plastic which works perfectly fine but having more metal to the touch or even a rubberized coating to give it a bit more texture would have been nice neither or I haven't been picking here these are quality built now B no claims these are sweat and water resistance and with my testing risking my $300 earphones obviously don't try this at home i drench them and they're still working perfectly fine today touching base on comfort and physical performance for ear tips are included plus one set of comply foam which works great if you want something a little bit more foam fitting or form-fitting that foam fitting that is but keep in mind these are in ear earphones versus many of the competitors which sits somewhat in ear now resulting in less passive noise isolation now one of the biggest praises for the e eights they black out most of your outside environmental noises because it's completely sealed in there they are very comfortable to wear as you can see they don't have air fans or ear wings for stability but they do stay in the ear very well also if you notice the Yeates might possibly have the lowest profile when wearing here and they don't stick out and look our can turn like the bose sound support fries that I just recently reviewed now moving on to the controls there are touch sensitive surfaces which very intuitive I'm both earpieces a nice alternative to the physical button that sometimes you have to press into your head to activate sometimes now a single tap pauses and plays your music as well as answer and end phone calls now if I'm is increased by tapping and holding the right earphone while holding the left side decreases it now I'll have a fullness and other side of my head here for your reference but the only feature that is not here basically and I wish every company would have this our voice prompts the e8 verbally doesn't tell me what my battery life is which device I'm paired to and besides a quick audio beef having a voice prompt to indicate if I'm in pairing mode or not would streamline my use now it's not a reason to not buy these but paying three hundred dollars those features would have been nice but getting back to the earphones I mentioned these are able to take phone calls and you do get some background noise for cars driving by and footsteps being horrible like other ear phones but the voice on the other end came in super clear here and my voice for the recipients on the other end was good enough and I know how to pretend crystal clear but it's very much usable also during phone calls the eh turns on the external microphones and pumps your surrounding audio ambient noise here into your ears so it eliminates all of the passive noise isolation for safety that's a pretty cool feature now moving on to the case it is small and when you first open the retail package it's gonna smell like a shoe store or some high-end leather boots so make sure you take a whiff here but also yours this a case very premium leather soft and supple and when you open it they do hold the ear buds with magnets which holds perfectly fine the case itself is able to charge your earphones two additional times essentially holding an additional eight hours of battery life and you can check how many additional charge cycles you have with the two LED lights on the rear pretty convenient now speaking of better life veno claims at four hours of playtime in my testing playing audio at 50% from full to bed I managed to get four hours in 25 minutes there's also quick charging which helps for men sleep with 20 minutes on the charger providing you an additional hour worth of playback no touching based on Bluetooth performance the e8r equivalent bluetooth 4.2 testing them in the office with my iPhone 10 and having them go through two walls average 61 linear feet before the audio started to crackle and that's great for what we have today once it's paired the e aids does have a connection that's very stable for normal everyday use I never had an issue and all right last before I talk about the audio performance the one unique feature that be you know incorporated is transparency mode the microphone kicks on and you're able to select one or three levels to hear your environment with the left ear bub you can tap and turn it on or off but unfortunately you can't cycle through each option though you have to do so within the bill play app now with transparency mode activated it's perfect for runners are those walking during their commute and wanting to hear their environments again for safety again these provide excellent passive noise isolation if you want to eliminate that you have the option to do so so right folks to the moment you've been waiting for the audio test the e aids do get loud here I'm constantly fighting myself listening comfortably but loud s 60 to 70 percent vine bass wise they sound slightly bassy but tends to lean and the more accurate sound signature rather than truly being bass boosted now if I were to compare its Emily to the Bose sound support freeze and the job or support elites both absolutely truly wireless earphones it's not bass books it's sounding like a jaybird runs but it's a bit more of a true fine performance compared to a jaybird recent release if you're a bass head I will look into those but the eh is surely enough for most people now in the mid ranges there is a balance that equally and accurately portrays both the instruments and the vocals focus are surely not recessed but it does stand front and center without being bright now same with instruments and it's imaging it stands out but at a pleasing and neutral level they aren't colourful but as a positively to do sound accurate and well pronounced when you're listening to high-quality audio files as for the high notes music that's a bit more mellow doesn't have a lot of attack or is very fast per se sounded absolutely fine the it does absolutely well in that regards now when listening to the opposite where there's tons of synthesized high frequencies a lot of the upper frequencies are just going on it just sounds really cluttered you lose a lot of resolution and detail it gets slightly jumbled in at times not necessarily ear piercing but can be sharp at times on those fast attacking songs the high frequencies do overpower or overshadow the mid frequencies just by a smidge taking away from the experience a slight bit that is now as for soundstage the EAS perform better than average it's not the best but you do get some depth and truly clear left and right audio separation although it does better than half the market and competitors out there and wasn't as strong or close to say the Bose sound sport freeze or the shape or runs now Pino does offer the vo play app and offers a simplified tutor called tongue touch Odin gets you warm made the autumn muffled and didn't really increase bass to my liking increasing excited or bright slightly did help improve the audio to be a bit more pronounced but other that the app didn't offer much more besides better level indication and adjusting the transparency the tone of transparency settings which we discussed a little bit earlier and most will be fine having it and stock but the option to adjust is there now last but not least video delay has been a big topic and truly wireless earphones lately tested ee8 with netflix there's a fractional delay very minimal but on youtube you can see lips moving first before you hear the audio this was also the same on the sony WF 1000x and the bose sound support freeze that I've recently tested in the channel now they don't stick out my ear like crazy here which I absolutely am appreciative of they have decent better life and they stick inside your ear comfortably as well that might justify its price tag but the audio was not the best but it's on the very good side of things when listening to other truly wireless earphones that I have at the office so folks please let me know in the comment section below what you guys think as always be sure to LIKE and subscribe to show your support and finally man Facebook Twitter and or Instagram you guys take care and I'll see you on the next one bye you

4|pc|steam|gaming|music|movies|bass|review|test|gamesky|new|2018|best|platinum,2020-10-07 10:22:44.971138, [Music] all right you guys so welcome back to a brand new video today's video we're gonna be talking about a brand new headset that's a revamp on a classic headset now I'm talking about the brand new Sony Playstation gold [Music] now it comes with the USB dongle because this is a wireless headset and you do need that to be able to play wirelessly and you can do that through your ps4 and your PC it does come with a micro USB cable because that is for charging with these being Wireless you definitely want to make sure that they charge and to be honest battery life is not anything special in fact you're probably gonna get around eight to ten hours which in a gaming session is fun you're gonna find yourself that you're gonna be charging these things pretty often and so the last accessory that comes with it is the headphone cable now that way you can use these if they die you can use them plugged into your controller you can use them plugged in your phone Nintendo switch any other device that has a normal headphone jack alright so the headphones themselves as you can tell one of the big problems with the original PlayStation Gold wireless headset is the fact that they hinge because the old ones folded in was very fragile in fact they broke very often and a lot of people had that issue the headband on the other ones were a lot thicker they they thin down the design it's very sleek it's just black all over there is some gloss trim around right below where the ear cup is I don't like the gloss I don't like the fact that where you're touching all the buttons is going to be gloss so it's gonna pick up all the fingerprints that's just kind of nitpicking but I just thought I should point that out your left and right or marked on the inside right behind the ear cup which the ear cup does slide up and down inside the headband itself so the again but there being no hinges that is a nice way to be able to get them to fit and I found getting them to fit was no issue at all now the ear cups on these it is a very soft pleather now if I had to kind of describe the design of the ear cup if you're familiar with them at all the ear cup is like the PlayStation Gold as far as the way that it's lined up but it's the material of the Platinum I would say it's closer to the PlayStation platinum headset as far as the ear cups go they're really comfortable they do get warm so if you're gonna do long gaming sessions you're probably going to take some breaks here and there just to keep from overheating now buttons and controls every thing is on your left-hand side on the front part of the headphone right at the bottom is off one in two there's two sound settings that you can program by getting the headphone app within the PlayStation you're able to get you know there's only a few options right now but I know with updates they will add a lot more to these right above that is your sound and chat level it does have mic monitoring you you're able to control if you're wanting to hear more of the sound of the game or more of the chat you can control them right here on the front part now on the bottom is where you have your headphone jack and your micro USB port to where you plug them in you have your mute button and then you have your volume up and down and then at the very very back at the top is your virtual surround sound these do have virtual 7.1 surround sound and do an incredible job at separating sound and giving you really good awareness of where everything is at now let's go ahead since it was talking about the microphone you do see that there is not a pull out mic and one thing I do want to say is that the microphone on the original playstation gold was not anything special but let's go ahead and see what they sound like on the new gold alright so here is a mic test of the new playstation wireless gold as you can tell again the microphone I don't know what Sony's thinking they're just not putting any effort and making the mic sound good at least just give us a boom mic it's okay that if there's a microphone sticking out we will take that over having a microphone that sounds like this the microphone just sucks alright so build quality look at this you couldn't do this with the original PlayStation gold you can do this but you wouldn't be able to do it again because it's very likely it would snap I don't feel any issues with twisting this this right here the build quality alone is worth it now these do retail for $99 $99 is not bad at all for a wireless headset so now let's go ahead and get into the sound the sound of these to me is where they kind of fall in between the PlayStation Gold the original one and then the platinum it felt warmer to me sound wise which means it had a little basse little more oomph in the sound than it in the original playstation gold had with the virtual surround sound again you're just able to pinpoint where everything is located the presets that are built into it I didn't find anything that I liked more than anything else so I just kept it on the one setting which is just the one that's already built in and now that's what listening to music games everything like that one setting is to spawn enough the other ones to me just kind of are gimmicks and they're pinpointing things that I don't think are really that special now based on these I can tell you right now they're very punchy they're really warm sounding so like I said that also brings out explosions and gunshots it just feels more natural mids and troubles are very good it's really good at being able to hear vocals with people talking to you you can definitely definitely sound [ __ ] in these you you can tell where everything is I I had no issue being able to hear where everything was at it's just a very spacious headset now I can show you while they're on they don't stick out very much but there are Sony did design these so that they work with their VR headset so there is a gap here so that you don't have any interference if you're wanting to use these for your PlayStation VR and it does a damn good job with the VR headset now using these four movies is also incredible watching Netflix and anything like that on your Playstation or your PC these do a great job with that these really are geared towards being an entertainment headset as far as movies and games that's where they excel but as far as music goes I wouldn't buy these personally for music but you know for $99 to get a wireless gaming headset that sounds this good and offers this many features it's kind of hard to be alright guys so that is my review of the brand new Playstation Gold wireless headset from Sony I think they did a really good job they kept the price also at the exact same as the old they did some very very nice improvements except for the microphone which they haven't improved at all build quality is much better sound is much better it's just a really really great overall headset for under 100 bucks that's really the way to look at it alright guys so Sony the Sony you did a great job I really really recommend these if you're looking to buy a wireless headset that's under $100 it's gonna be really really hard to beat this unless you're just looking for an incredible microphone that's the only reason I would say not to get these if you don't use a mic or online play is not the most important thing to you if you're not streaming like twitch and stuff like that with a microphone these would definitely be the ones to get alright guys so thank you so much for checking out this video thank you guys so much for checking out all the other videos and as always guys make sure to stay tuned for more

bring you guys the newest stuff in the market Bose just released their sound sport wireless earphones geared towards Fitness fans out there now they come in two colors aqua which I have here and then there's that stuff all black model I did personally pay for this at the retail price of one hundred and fifty dollars making these slightly cheaper than some of the premium models out there but we'll see how these go though as always I'll place my links in the video description below click on my links and they will give you the most updated prices in real time and if you decide to buy of course this will help support my channel so without further ado Jimmy with Jim's review room and I'm here to help you make a purchase decision welcome everyone to another review going over the physical features first I do admit these are a bit bigger than what I anticipated but of course looks are subjective now although there's audio ports exposed Bose claims these are to be water in sweat resistant and for my testing spring water all over these the Bose sound sports still works perfectly fine now looking at the right earphone there's your power button up top LEDs to indicate when this is fully charged or almost dead in regards to battery life and a Bluetooth connection indicator on the bottom there is a microUSB port for charging the sound sports and Bose is claiming up to six hours of use which is somewhat in the mid-range when you're comparing with other sport your phones on the market at 50% vibe I was able to get seven hours and four minutes worth of use now moving on with the physical bill the left ear but doesn't have any physical buttons or features but moving down the cord here it's thick and feels very durable while still being very flexible tossing these into my bag without the included case they never tangled or under abuse they held up really well now there is an inline controller with volume up and down with a pause play and song skipping feature and this does work for both Apple and Android devices the only thing though the buttons are very firm compared to any other earphones I've tested also when pressing the buttons you do feel the buttons slide from side to side from time to time which was a bit unusual at first it's not a deal-breaker but I do admit you do get used to it after your first use or two but something I wanted to point out now last the inline controller does come with NFC or near field communication built-in which is very handy tap your NFC compatible phone and the earphones pairs with your device automatically last you can use this as a headset for phone calls and testing this with several friends my voice is very clear it does pick up some background noise though but at least my voice didn't sound far away or distorted it performs very well though now going into comfort both features they're super soft ear tips called stay here plus three ear tips are included from small medium to large and of course the fit will be subjective as everyone's ears are a little bit different here but for the most part they stayed in my ears very well here but not the perfect skier hold that I was looking for the stay here ear tips are not in your earphones they're not snug inside that ear canal but it rests on the opening you can still hear your environments which is ideal for cyclists or runners to ensure that you may hear someone coming up on you or maybe here traffic around you they are very comfortable however during vigorous activities at least for my ears again the top ear wing would pop out sometimes and the earphones would not fall out though but I would periodically have to push that top ear wing back in from my channel and reviewing previous Bose products most people do find their general ear tips to work really well though so I would still give them a shot regarding wire noise when you are running the wires can bounce around or rub against ur shirts but these sound sports does very well not carrying any noise into the earphones when music is going you don't hear the wires bouncing around at all something to look into when you are looking for earphones in general and last regarding sound quality in BOCES fashion here they still provide a very nice clean audio signature it's not loud or brash but a sound signature that is very easy to listen to even at loud violence you won't have hearing fatigue after you're done using them now Bose is claiming to have a dynamic volume optimized equalizer so the sound characteristics would change as you adjust vine up and down I didn't notice really much of a change but it all happens behind the scenes but in general here base is punchy fast and accurate it's not a deep sub bass it doesn't Rumble like the powerbeats2 or have a bass booster signature like the j-bird products if you prefer that more accurate and clean audio signature the bose performs good in that aspect regarding the mids it's clear accurate once again it isn't bright at all nor is it recessed or boxy it really performs right in the middle of the audio spectrum feeling unaltered but the highs are distortion free and turn this up at much higher violence there's no ting or ear ringing I do admit though the top-end doesn't sound as detailed though as I would have hoped top hats cymbal crashes and the likes we're not as acute at louder vibes sensing there some roll-off from Bose to keep the audio signature safe from going overboard now regarding soundstage there isn't much there but I have noticed though most sport earphones I've reviewed so far they don't provide much of a soundstage anyways the only brand that does provide a very expansive experience has been j-bird and les regarding wireless range these work perfectly walked from one side of the house to the other and downstairs as well the signal never broke or degraded when going through several walls and the first floor ceiling last both introduced their own app when they released the bose qc25 headphones and a sound sport here works with the same app just like the QC 35s experience there isn't much there there's a battery level indicator volume adjustment if you go into settings you can adjust the power down time period when the earphones are not in use turn on or off the voice prompts and manage your parrot devices other than that there's no audio profiles there's no app equalizer or a music player built-in so that's everything on the new bose sound support wireless here I really do like them and the audio signature is very clean the fit was good but not the greatest to me however they were very comfortable again folks check out my links in the description below for the updated prices and be sure to LIKE and subscribe if you haven't follow me on Facebook

my quest for the perfect gaming headset continues - everybody take a look at something from Coursera these are the new virtuoso wireless gaming headsets something they sent over because they saw how I was not happy with the GS 670 or whatever it's called from Sennheiser because the mic quality was so terrible they didn't even say I had to do a review on these but I figured I would share because I can't be the only person searching for a wireless headset that doesn't suck today's video is brought to you by Nord VPN a virtual private network things that you should have and plenty of you still don't which baffles me but I guess that's kind of the whole point of this ad now listen a VPN which stands for a virtual private network is extremely important whether you're browsing on your phone your laptop your desktop if you are sending information out to the Internet you never know who's looking at it which is why a virtual private network with military-grade encryption like Nord VPN is a must especially with the holiday season coming up on with all the travel you're probably going to be doing whether you want to or not you're still going to be doing it get your devices protected the Nord VPN has thousands of servers across 60 countries to make sure that no matter where you're connected or traveling this holiday season you are going to be protected minority PM takes your data packages it up into a nice encrypted packet sends it off to the server and then connects to the internet from there so prying eyes have absolutely no idea on the networks that you're connected on as to what you're doing online your ISP is also like to slow you down because they want to shape your traffic to make sure you're not using all of your bandwidth with things like Netflix and YouTube like this video right here but if you don't know what you're doing they can't really slow you down so show your ISP who's boss by downloading Nord VPN today now by using my link and my offer code in the description below j-su cents at checkout you can get 70% off a three-year membership and given how expensive a VPN is I think you can go without a coffee or two per month to pay for this don't wait any longer pause the video click the link in the description below use my offer code Jase two cents that check out and get Nord VPN today alright so the two products we're taking a look here are virtually the same but virtually the virtuoso this is a SC for special edition and then we've got the just the rail er virtuoso so these are in white they're also available in black we'll kind of take a look at the build difference between the two of them but in terms of the important parts the mic quality the headphone drivers the slipstream technology the fact that they can be used as both wired and wireless and yes spoiler alert unlike the Sennheiser's when they're plugged into a cable you do get increased bandwidth connectivity with your PC which means better mic quality and the sound quality is pretty much the same because sound is still the priority when it comes to the compression there's a little bit of difference in the microphone but we're talking about these because they're they're actually worth talking about so all the important parts the headband design the ear cup design the foam Manila it's the same on these the difference is just a little bit more of a premium build on these guys the SES then on the standard plastic ones although they still say aluminium to our plastic bits will show you what they are and I don't normally do unboxings but these are important when it comes to peripherals like this especially headphones so these are the special editions I've already been using them a little bit so a little bit of fingerprints and dirt on there they are brushed aluminum or aluminium depending what part of the world you're from when it comes to the cans so this part right here is very attractive-looking what I like is they don't have a stupid look about them do you see how stupid these look I swear to god I look like I'm a crew chief on some sort of a NASCAR team these look ridiculous on my head like build quality I would say that they're very similar but just look at the difference here like that's more of a head shape whose head is this shape actually when Phil put him on I didn't look as ridiculous because Phil's got a very round head I've got a very square narrow head but when I put these on I feel less stupid I still probably look pretty Susie but the first thing you might notice is obviously there's no cables attached to it and there's no microphone they come with this carrying bag right here and the reason why you might want a carrying bag for them is because as you also notice like we just said and there's also stuff in there with words on it we have our microphone which obviously is detachable and it only goes one way like the hey only goes on your left side this is where I'm gonna give points actually to Sennheiser I have become a huge fan because I've been using the game zeroes and the PC 37 X is now exclusively for like four years but what I love is this this swivel way swivel away microphone and you can hear that click when it swivels up it automatically mutes so the very first time I was wearing these I was like just on the microphone and it just bent up and nothing happened I was like oh yeah because the mute button for this is located right on the bottom right there so as you can see this is you know bendable because of the fact that everyone's mouth and head is a little bit different so it only goes one way and there's that even the the microphone end right here is I believe that too aluminum as well so when it comes to the dongle here it is right here this is a 2.4 gigahertz dongle using Corsairs new slipstream technology something they actually talked about at CES you can control up to 3 devices at the same time anything 3 devices that use slipstream so that can be headsets mice keyboards but it also has its like active scanning for finding strong signals because 2.4 is so crowded it's constantly scanning for stronger signals or clearer signals I should say and it dynamically adjusts without having any sort of dropouts which because of that they're boasting a like higher than ever signal strength which also means longer range and better connectivity for Less dropouts so there's that so you've got two cables here one that's a lot less relevant today than it's ever been that being a headphone jack for your phone's because now that Samsung has also kind of dropped the headphone jack you're going to need this into a dongle into a USB C or lightning or whatever connector you need for your phone you could take this mic off and you could use these as a wired connection device to your phones when you're on the bus to school or the train or whatever and have a single product that kind of meets all of your needs there I personally never use these because I don't know I don't really listen to music and stuff when I travel like to just take that moment to relax without hearing kids screaming and YouTube people commenters yelling at me and yeah I'm kind of boring in terms of build quality we've got what feels like a leather it's probably a pleather but it's a memory foam up in here in the headband so it's nice and squishy obviously it's got stability on either side metal hinge so this is going to be nice and robust this is often where gaming headsets break let's face it we're gamers we get mad we throw our when we are not Battle Royale or we lose an arena and Warcraft or whatever they they're robust trust me I know I've already thrown them once I got durability tests you've got to do it but you know you pick up something you go oh yeah yeah I feels like quality yeah that's exactly what these feel like because they are fairly round instead of like ear shaped I find that my ear tends to touch the bottom and the top just a little bit doesn't really seem to bug me a whole lot but it's something worth mentioning my ear does not touch the actual driver cover at all speaking of driver these are 50 millimeter drivers so they definitely are able to reproduce some low-frequency bass but in terms of buttons you've got a volume dial on the back of the right hand side or back of the right ear cup so this will tie right into your windows volume it's a little laggy and that you've got to kind of scroll it quite a bit to get it to go up and down in volume and then we've got a toggle here that switches between wired and wireless that's also your power switch so by switching it to wireless I just turned them on and that's why you're seeing now the the colors going there and then if you switch it back to wired that's also what turns it off now USBC cable here which is what's gonna be terminating to your standard USB to a USB see this is also your charger cable you can charge while still connected to wireless but if you're connected to the computer I would just switch it to Wired mode you're gonna get better mic quality anyway so what's the difference now between the SES and the standard edition this is plastic instead of the brushed metal which you can see right there you can see they're the same hinge the same ear-cups the real difference here is the fact that you don't get the carrying bag with them and they've got that plastic face otherwise all the accessories that come in this box are exactly the same well though the microphone is slightly different appearance wise so you can see it's a much smaller piece in the end where the microphone goes this is the special edition now before we talk about the sound quality of them I want to talk about a few of the the software features now IQ is technically how you support and control this headset things like the RGB LEDs built into them which if I turn on right here you'll see so the RGB that's inside of them the EQ is controlled by IQ the EQ and IQ also side tone side tone is important with these because they're so they're so good at sound isolation you can find yourself probably screaming at people not realizing how loud you're talking so a side tone what it does is it feeds some of the microphone back into the headset so that you can hear your own voice that way you're not screening those are the three major functions you get like IQ really is kind of lackluster in terms of control on this there's no loudness control I wish that there was more volume coming out of these and that could just be I don't know what the limitations are over the the actual USB power signal but I feel like because these are 50 millimeter drivers I'm feeling like these need to be a little bit louder I feel like they're relying heavily on the sound isolation of these to make them seem louder than you than they are but you don't need IQ that's kind of the best part about this is unless you are using some sort of a standalone well--that's are not using some sort of stand-alone third-party application that could control USB devices and apply an EQ on top of the controller you really don't need Iike EQ IQ I went in there and I downloaded it but it's not installed I just left the screen up right there so you could see that this is without IQ I'm just plugging in the wireless dongle or the wireless wired USB C hooked up to the headset it's automatically setting it up as a USB device that's a nice thing about it being USB at least where analog headphones you know you've got to run them through an amp analog is definitely to get you the most control because if you're a true audiophile you're gonna probably have headphone amplifiers anyway at the very least deck so you probably wouldn't be using a USB device anyway if you're an audiophile so if you're an audio file when you're here watching these it's probably just to make fun of them and get you trust me I get you I digress when it comes to setting them up though windows handles everything because it's a standard USB device the unfortunate thing about doing a review about headphones is I you cannot experience them I could only relay what my inner ear hairs and inner drum is hearing and all of our hearing is different so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try to do the best I can to describe the soundstage of these one they are either a 7.1 simulate which is again controlled an IQ or a standard stereo I tend to leave them in stereo I'm not a fan of 7.1 simulate I find the sound statements around to sound obnoxiously wide and distant now the sound stage on stereo is still very wide and spacious but realistic the base frequency of these I did I did a sweeping bass test with these with a sweeping tone at 35 Hertz I still got some some audio out of it I don't know what the SPL level would have been but it was extremely shallow but it was still audible at 50 Hertz they definitely recreated a good amount of bass but not overpowering it doesn't muddy the rest of the the frequency but I feel like of course there's done a really good job at tuning the frequency on these to give you a full soundstage on these where you're able to get good lows clear mids crisp eyes it's the best way to explain it I've said it before I'm gonna say it again IQ needs work there I was getting random crashes I was getting one time the microphone wouldn't work at all Corsair reached back out to us we did talk to them there is still some tuning that's happening with these in terms of software and there may be some more features that'll come online in the future hopefully some sort of loudness control or just an overall volume bump but if you just let windows control it you still get a really good experience it's time to do the mic test though because sound quality of these in my opinion are matched with the Sun Heiser's a little bit lower volume but in terms of clarity and just richness or fullness I guess these are definitely on par with a more expensive headset so we've got audacity going here we also have our AC going and the reason why I'm doing that is I'm curious as to what the noise cancellation of this is like so you can see if the capsule picks up right here is a little bit of an opening it should be rejecting a lot of the background noise but the AC is pretty loud this would be the equivalent of having like a window AC in your room running that's how much volume there is coming from it so I want to see how well it can reject that sound and then we'll turn it off that way it's a pretty clean mic test about any sort of ambient noise sort of affecting any of the white noise or the sound floor because the audacity is seeing us is that this is the waveform you can see it's the volume is pretty good we've not gone into windows and changed any of the settings it's still set to microphone being maximum level so three two one one two three and I didn't even get fill of clap so I'll give it to him at the end of the clip so you could sink it there so one thing I want to point out is I don't know if there's a built-in pop filter in this I've gotten to the point to where I figured out exactly where I can put it but if I move it like so right here so my nose is being picked up Pease Paul Peter picked a peck of pickled peppers Paul's hardware is Paulie but he shares another Twitter handle with another Paul's Ace Hardware and people keep tweeting at Paul's Ace Hardware thinking it's Paul's hardware and apparently they have thought hot dog sales apparently the nice thing about this being adjustable like this is you can move it all around you can move it down a little bit but then the nose gets it the mouth doesn't then I thing about being adjustable Mike as you can find a spot none of your air gets it but we're gonna do now is we are going to go ahead and switch over to wireless because what I love about this headset and I said the Sennheiser's don't is it goes oh hey we're wired we have more audio bandwidth available to us for the microphone so let's leverage that alright so we turned off the AC because like I said we want to make sure that there's no contamination of background noise that was a really loud AC so we're gonna do now is now we're gonna do another we are unwired right okay up is wired we're gonna do a wired versus Wireless saying the same sentence so you guys can kind of hear them back to back this is wired the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog Peter picked a peck of pickled peppers so here is the wireless test the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog Peter picked a peck pick a peck of peppers pickled pepper she sells seashells down by the seashore these are by far the best wireless headphones I've listened to in terms of microphone quality but there's a little bit of artifacting which sounds like the best way to describe it it sounds like a slight crackling right underneath the audio it's not annoying and it's a hundred percent better than this crap this is genuine disappointment because it means that these will not be come my daily driver microphone but at the end of the day you have options with this and I think that that's what's making this like 95% of what I'm looking for in a gaming headset Coursera sent these over specifically because of that Sennheiser review and they're like hey we've got a new headset coming tell us what you think don't even have to make a review about it but I chose to make this review because I think they're based on that Sennheiser video there's a lot of people in my particular boat that I like boats there's a lot of people in my boat that are looking for the same thing okay what's the USS wireless headset okay but Jay if it's 95% there what's wrong with them I want more volume out of them I like loud I've killed my hearing already with shooting guns for recreation and doing I used to actually build base systems for DB drags back in the early 2000s and that kind of fried a lot of my hearing I hope Corsair can increase the volume of these a little bit through a software update I will probably use these wired more than wireless but I wanted the wireless option the problem is if you look right here they come off at about a 45 degree angle on that ear off that ear cut it's a big dongle or the USB see where it plugs in which is knurled and metal and beefy and this is a braided cable which is awesome but it points it right at my shoulder so when I turn my head to all that sound travels through the wire into the ear cup and I can hear it it's like a cannon a string when you talk to two people with two Bulger's cans in a string it's the same thing the sound travels through and it's picked up in my ear cut they prioritized the straight down plug for the one I'm never going to use which is the three-and-a-half millimeter dual Jack for mic and headset for your smartphone or your mp3 player or whatever I feel like that should be reversed I feel like I should have the smaller jack coming out the back and the bigger jack coming straight down the other thing is when I'm hooked up to the wired and and Corsair has acknowledged that they are trying to recreate this and they're trying to figure out what our particular issue was on my desk both desktops here at the studio and at home I was getting not enough USB resources for the device error popping up consistently what ended up solving it quite honestly was toggling this to wireless and back to wired and then it didn't do it again so there's still some bugs in there I know I did it these are probably my daily drivers now I never bothered with the Sennheiser because of that mic quality I mean that is so so terrible the two versions of these are like I said they're gonna be more so in premium quality of some of the materials used but if you want to save some money I would just recommend getting the black or the white they're gonna sound the same they're gonna feel the same we're just gonna have the brushed aluminum sides right there and you're gonna save like 30 bucks the thing is if you compare the pricing of these versus like the sennheiser products or some of the other wireless stuff that's out there like the Astros and all that these are a heck of a lot cheaper these are under $200 and look how bright the LEDs are on these guys like I feel like the LEDs are better on here then on here because these are having to shine through that drilled out aluminum and you can see there's much more glow to those if you want glowy well there you go so huge thank you to Corsair for sending these over to us for us to take a look at like I said they were very much so like you don't have to make a review I think cuz they saw how harsh I was with the Sennheiser I've got nothing but good things to say about it I just would like to see the software that controls them improve and that's pretty much it you guys any headphones out there you think I should take a look at make sure you put them down the comments below I'm still looking for that 100% satisfying experience I'm really picky if you can't tell alright that's it thanks bye

The JBL C100 TWS earphones are officially sold in India via flipkart http://bit.ly/JBLc100GR",28,842321,1522.0,15548.0,932.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n9hbt7lVYig/hqdefault.jpg,jbl c100 tws|jbl wireless earphones|jbl c100 india|jbl c100 wireless|jbl true wireless|jbl c100|geekyranjit,2020-10-07 10:22:45.248476, hi there this is Ranjith and in this video let's do the review of the newly launched JBL 300 tws true a wireless earbuds and as you can see guys it's over here I've already opened it up and I've been testing it for a day or so so actually these go inside these like this left and right oh yeah one over here and it closes in the box and as you can see it also has a LED light over here that Meno means it's actually charging while it's charging it denotes and right now the battery is about 50 percent handsets - lets we have three less you'll come back to this later so it comes in this box and it says pure bass and definitely yes the bass is actually significantly boosted on these ones and yeah it says that the pricing is seven thousand nine hundred on because it's available on Flipkart for three thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine rupees as you can see what the link and again here gives us a basic idea about the yacht's we actually have physical buttons I'll show you so you can control a lot of stuff and also the battery life in my testing was actually pretty good on this one they came about five hours with the buds but you also have that case so it's about 12 hours of extra on this one so apart from this you just get a few other accessories I will just show you that it is a box you get a micro USB cable sadly yes micro USB not USB type-c and we also get extra pair of the year tips to extra in get on this I didn't change it I'm using the default one it fitted me perfectly but my daughter said that the default fit was a little bit tight so you might have to change can start from that the standard manual and stuff we get at Quick Start Guide and all those things and basic stock I would say so let me take these things to the side for now and let's look at these so this is the main thing and as you can see it has that JBL branding and this is actually made up of plastic but it's actually decent quality plastic but again as I have told you um the charging is micro USB the latest I've seen but apart from that reacts okay and you open this up and these are true Wireless so you take it out and while it's charging me also I don't think so yeah camera can pick it up we also have a small LED Lee on this tip trial it's charging this also close in white color when it's in the box but again you don't have to worry as it's charging it denotes like this so it just stays on like this while it's charging when it's fully charged please just stop so that's what it is and if you just take these out and put you can put it in here left and right and guys because these are in here they do form a good seal so sort of acts like noise cancellation they don't have any active noise cancellation but the seal is actually really good so it blocks about 90% of the sound around you and even at about 50% volume if you're listening you can't hear anything so it's passive for noise cancellation that we have and in terms of comfort myself told you I didn't change the tips I'm using default tips and for me they're comfortable they sit in your year and if you do this also it does not fall but again you might have to change the tips for the perfect effort you have to play around for that and it just fits in here like this or it will be looking like this as you can see apart from thing this one good thing that I like on these earbuds is that you have that JBL logo but we actually have physical buttons both on the right side like this and even on the left side and using this you control stuff for example on the right side one you can play in pause music why this I've just activated it and I'll just press it once or just force and when you get a call also you can actually just press this and you can take the call and the left one you will use again this also has a physical button you'll use it to skip tracks or even go back to a previous track so that is the functionality and I really like this one because with many of the other earbuds and stuff the problem is that they have that touch sensor or something and most of time it does not work with this one we don't have that problem because it's a physical button that we are getting and it works every time and again one of the thing that I've noticed is that as you can see I have only one bird oh yes and other but I've just kept it back here and it works that we also for example while you're taking calls and stuff you don't want both of them so you can just put one and it worked so that is also a good thing with this one so that's what it is now let's talk about the battery life the battery life as I've told you the battery life is actually pretty good on this one roughly about four or slightly above four hours you should get within a charge but again you will keep it back in this what do you say charger this case so it starts charging automatically and this will give you about three charges and it charged this this will take approximately about to us so I mean typical what you get seeing stuff so battery life is good because many of the year but generally these portable ones give about two or three hours this is decent enough this will give you more than about for us and the pairing was also not an issue as you can see you also have these LED lights over here it's glowing here it's connected to my phone that's why so you have that so you have that notification and now if we talk about the Bluetooth range here also I was happy with a brutal three these are typical the supports Bluetooth file and these typically have the about thirty feet of line of sight if nothing is there but again you don't use it like that in a typical room I would say I was able to hear the songs without any skip page even when I was in the next room without any issue so the range is actually good on this one not a problem with the range and yesterday I used it continuously for about three and a half hours I even watch the movie I listen to music and during the three hours continuously it never disconnected or skipped so that's actually nice now let's talk about the one of the most important things I feel that is how does it sound if I have to rate it first let's divide it into three parts the bass then we'll talk about mid-tones the vocals and mid-tones and the height and here I would say in terms of bass as you see in the box it says that pure beings and stuff I think so they have gone really bonkers with that definitely the base is sort of emphasized on this one and boost it quite a bit don't get me wrong I I would say the base is more emphasized but that is the sound signature that most of us Indians actually like we like some extended base so you definitely had that but I would say they have really tuned it to have that extra extra base for most of the music I really enjoyed the bass that you are getting but we do have some tracks we are already we have some boosted bass I felt that the bass was slightly excessive so in terms of bass I would rated 8 out of 10 now if we talk about the vocals and the mid-tones here I would say JB and has really nailed it the vocals sounded spectacular smooth really forward they do I feel how its tuned the vocals stand out quite a bit on this one and the mid-tones are also produced very well the sounds of instruments and stuff of very very soothing so I would rate it 10 on 10 in terms of vocals and mid-tones and now moving to the higher tone higher frequencies they were also very well produced on this one and I would rate it nine point five out of ten so overall I would say very good sounding your Falls but suddenly it does have that slightly excessive bass which I feel many of the users at least in India like that and if I have to talk about the soundstage the sound state is also very good it has excellent excellent stereo separation you can really make out that the sound is coming from this track this the what do you say instrument separation is also done very well so the sound stage is also very very damp so overall they sound really great I would say the battery life is also a decent if after nitpick the two minor cons that I notice with this one as that micro USB port instead of USB type-c that you are getting on this one and that slightly extended bass that I've noticed but again I feel most of you would like that and if I have to actually read these earphones I would rate them 4.5 out of 5 so guys that was my review of the said JBL c100 pw s and these are sold in india why I flipped on I leave the link in the description below for reference anyways guys what do you feel about these one and if you guys are still not subscribed to my

In this video, I unbox and review the NEW Elite ACTIVE 65T true wireless earphones from Jabra. The earphones have 15 hours of battery, bluetooth 5.0 and perhaps the best audio of any true wireless earphones. I'll be comparing these against the Elite SPORT, Jabra's dedicated sports earbuds, to see which of these is the best for those with an active lifestyle. Could either of these be the best true wireless earphones out there?

earbuds|best true wireless sports earbuds,2020-10-07 10:22:45.248501, [Music] hi everyone and welcome back to inside tech Apple's air pods were amongst the first that truly revolutionized the wireless air but industry but with no options to adjust the volume exclusive features to iOS and a somewhat questionable design many people are now looking to other in some cases superior competitors the elite 65 TS are arguably the best of these alternatives competing in terms of battery and connection and succeeding with audio quality and design now jabber aback with the new elite active 65 t an upgrade suitable for those with a more active lifestyle in this video i'll be comparing these against Jerez dedicated sports earbuds the elite sport hopefully by the end of the video you'll have a better idea which of these earphones is right for you and if either of these can be crowned the champion of true wireless earphones let's take a look [Music] I'll be unboxing both earbuds side-by-side with the black elites port on the left and the copper blue Alif active on the right both the original color designs both boxes indicate the headphones are suitable for sports in fact the elites Porter branded the most technically advanced true Wireless sports air buds so during the video we'll see just how accurate this claim really is the boxes have a similar design pattern but have different opening mechanisms the sports with an easier to access magnetic clasp whilst the active simply slide out from the sleeve getting into the boxes though both have the earbuds and their charging case is packaged separately and have largely the same accessories each include the Quick Start Guide safety and warranty info and a micro USB cable for charging again a pet peeve of mine is that even a 20-18 pair of true wireless earbuds doesn't feature USB see the elite actives come with a set of small medium and large silicon ear tips whereas the elites board have a range of silicon and foam ear tips plus a choice of wind tips which will definitely come in handy for more rigorous exercising sadly wingtips are not compatible with the elite active 65 T accessories aside we can turn our attention back to the earbuds and they're charging cases which have slightly different designs the elite sport charging case is rectangular with the micro USB ports on the side there's a hidden LED indicator located just next to this and there are LEDs for aged earbud on the case as well the case snaps open and close from a sturdy hinge and there's space inside for your earbuds if you're using the included wing tips via buds themselves are made from silicone rubber and weigh in at 6 and 1/2 grams each they both feature LEDs for microphones to maximize call quality and the elite sport contains a built-in heart rate monitor and analyzer the earbuds are also ip67 rated so they're not only completely dust proof but also fully waterproof up to one meter for 30 minutes the elite active case features a rounded capsule light design where the microUSB port and led are located at the bottom I did find this case a little more tricky to open especially at the beginning but this does become easier over time B about themselves feature a silicon rubber and plastic combination and have gold-plated metal covering the LEDs interestingly the right earbud is also six and a half grams but the left is only five point eight we also have a four mic system and accelerometer and motion sensor but no heart rate monitor with this model the 65 TI P 56 rated so again completely dust proof and resistant to powerful Jets of water but you won't be able to fully submerge this model it's also fairly easy to drop either of these earbuds into the charging case but sadly neither feature magnets to lock your earbuds in place a nice feature is that removing the air bus from the case will wake them automatically and they'll connect to the last pair device when you place them back they'll automatically disconnect and switch off so after the initial pairing you'll never need to physically turn on or off the earbuds and this does work with both models between models we have slightly different control systems with the elite sport the left earbud features clickable volume buttons which also serve to skip tracks forward and back the right earbud features clickable sports and also multifunction buttons the sports button is used for various commands which are all directed through the Jabra sport life app and I'll talk more about this later on the multifunction button is used to play pause music answer and hang up phone calls and also to bring up your phone's voice assistant it's also used to activate the hair through feature turning on the microphones to allow you to hear your surroundings whilst the sports earbuds did offer a wide variety of control options I did find the buttons themselves quite difficult to press they give a satisfying click when pressed but do require a fair amount of force to trigger for me this meant pressing the earbud further into my ear canal which sometimes caused a little discomfort a workaround I found was to secure the ear but with a couple of fingers before pressing the buttons the right earbud can also be used on its own for mono playback in fact removing the left ear bud will automatically switch the right ear bud to mono and stereo playback resumes when the left earbud is placed back there are however no auto pause options here with the Elise active the control scheme is much more refined and simple the left ear but again features volume up and down which can be held to skip tracks the right earbud features just a single multifunction button used for play/pause phone calls and activating your phone's voice assistant if you prefer you can also switch this command to instead activate Alexa or the Google assistant using the jabber sound Plus app transforming your earbuds into a controller for your lights and speakers but you may need their accompanying apps to gain full voice control again the here through feature is activated with a double press the elite active earbuds contain a proximity sensor so removing either earbud can auto pause your music the writing part can also be is for mono playback by removing the left earbud and pressing the right ear bug to continue play back again I did need to use a few fingers when pressing the controls to avoid discomfort but the elite active buttons were far easier to press requiring less force and I did prefer the overall simplified control scheme and auto paws feature one important thing I'd like to mention about these earbuds is that selecting the right ear tips and wingtips as well as how you position the earbuds in your is is absolutely crucial to getting the most out of them it's also vital for ensuring the year but stay secure during a workout when I first use these earbuds I was initially disappointed in the sound quality but once I'd got the fit just right they sounded fantastic so make sure to spend some time trying all of the ear tip combinations until you find the best fit for you for the elite sport the jabber spot life app unlocks a whole host of additional features transforming the earbuds into your own personal fitness coach the breadth of features here is astonishing from personalized training plans to automatic rep counting using the accelerometer to voice coaching you through a workout you can customize exactly what information is displayed or called out during a run and the app is definitely one of the best I've ever used for fitness tracking the inbuilt heart rate monitor is also extremely accurate I tested these extensively and found them to always be within 1 or 2 beats per minute of my Apple watch the automatic rep counting also works surprisingly well and after using these for a number of weeks I've yet to have any inaccuracies counting reps during workouts using the included win tips I found the earbuds stayed locked perfectly in place during workouts without so much as a hint of the moving let alone falling out within the app you can also access the other earbud settings such as the here 3 feature headphone readouts and the built-in equalizer I definitely would recommend adjusting this from the flat sounding default to the earbuds arrived with and I personally found this custom profile to sound the best but this will be down to personal preference we also have options here to share your workout data through social media and also to link the earbuds up with sports communities a unique feature to the elite sport is that if you ever lose of the Everts you can use GPS to locate them and even play a sound through the efforts to assist with location the abundance of features here is truly remarkable but how well these all worked was perhaps even more impressive I can definitely believe that the elite sports are in fact the world's most technically advanced true Wireless sports air buds and these are probably the best sports ear buds I've ever used the elite active 65 tees instead use the [ __ ] resound Plus app here you'll be able to customize your own quick toggle sound modes to suit different scenarios such as commuting a focus mode and an active mode again here you can access the hear through and readout settings but also customize both the music and call quality with the custom equalizer just as with the elite sport I would recommend changing this from the default setting the app doesn't have the same range of sports features as are available to the elite sports but it does include a built-in step counter perhaps my favorite feature here though is the included ambient noise sound board here you can select from a range of high-quality ambient sounds but can really transport you to the different environments the perfect storm and cabin sounds were particularly effective and those who enjoy ambient noise whilst reading or studying can definitely make good use of this feature overall I would say that the active sixty-five tees are geared more towards general use rather than being a clearly dedicated sports earbud like the elite sport I personally found that I can get a more secure fit into my ear canal then with the sports earbuds and I did find that these also stayed secure during a workout but on a couple of occasions I could fill the year but starting to slip and I had to press them back into position this really put into perspective the importance of the elite sports wingtips and without these I can't say it feel 100% confident trusting these to stay in my ears whilst out for a run looking at connectivity the elite sport uses Bluetooth 4.2 and I found that these gave me a line of sight distance from my phone of around 80 feet what do you think between the two earbuds was perfect and the latency was also not bad at all although as with any true wireless earbuds they are geared more towards audio than video and the audio delay from the image may be a little too great for some listeners the elite active 65 T's use bluetooth 5.0 and although I couldn't make full use of this technology they did give a huge line of sight distance just shy of 100 feet again there were no syncing issues between the earbuds whatsoever and the connection in obstructed environments was particularly impressive the updated elite sport earbuds give four and a half hours from a single charge although I found this figure to be closer to five hours with everyday use the original model only gives three and a half hours so just check for the 13.5 inscription in the charging case or on the earbuds themselves to check that you have the updated model the case holds a further two charges for the earbuds which itself could be charged in just under three hours with the earbuds inside or two hours to charge only the case the earbuds also have a fast charge feature at a twenty minute charge will give you one hour of playback the 65 T's hold a full 5 hours of charge which I found in practice to be just about right and the case holds an additional two charges the case charging time is the same as the elite sport and these also have a fast charge feature delivering one hour of playback after around 15 minutes of charging both sets of earbuds have a very similar sound profile the basin mid range is very good with the former being particularly impressive since this is where true wireless earphones normally fall short the base has a decent thump and complements the mid-range frequencies giving an overall full-bodied sound the treble is quite even giving balanced vocals so only the overly bright songs may give you trouble with sharp s sounds I would perhaps say that the clarity isn't perfect and the sound can be a little muddy but using the custom equalizer and of course securing a good fit inside your ear will definitely maximize your listening experience to describe the differences between the models I'd simply say over the active 65 TS have a much more refined and rich sound compared to the elite sport vocals a much more distinctive and the sound is fuller with greater detail I was also able to secure a better fits compared with the elite sport which definitely enhanced the audio the passive noise isolation is excellent so long as you can get that good fit and the sound leakage was almost non-existent so these will be excellent to use in public places call quality was also very clear and the earbud microphones were particularly impressive especially since neither model features an overly extended microphone antenna both models picked up my voice really well and I never had to raise my voice to be heard during a phone call considering their size and weight the audio quality delivered by these earphones particularly the elite active 65 T was really impressive the convenience of these compact earphones is obvious but now that true wireless earphones can compete in terms of audio quality I can't see a reason why to use any other earphones or headphones on day to day basis if I were to touch on a couple of cons with these earphones that I would say that I would have liked to have seen some magnets to hold the earbuds in the charging case for that extra security I'd also refine the control scheme with the elite sport and perhaps even the elite active just to make the buttons a little easier to press so that you don't risk pushing the earbuds into your ear canal an argument for touch controls could be made here on the whole long these were some of the best true wireless earphones that I've tested and I definitely say that the elite sport were the best true Wireless sports air buds that I've used with the wingtips providing that extra stability I'd probably go for these if you're planning on using your earphones for exercising regularly the sixty-five tees are definitely more suitable for everyday use but the superior audio quality and connection make these my choice for my daily earphones for light exercising or if you are able to get a secure fit the active model could be an excellent all-round solution and with those small improvements these could be the better option for me Jerez elite active 65 t are the best true wireless earphones on the market but let me know in the comments what you think the best true wireless earphones are do these really beats Apple's air pods or perhaps you prefer the bose or Samsung alternatives if you liked the video or found it at all helpful then please give it a like don't forget to subscribe to the

2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 they so around about six seconds and you can see now it went to blue to turn on and now it's gone blue red blue red blue red so that's now looking for a Bluetooth device we're now going to turn on this one here again this will go on this particular one it will go blue red blue red blue red while it looks for a device so I'm holding it in there there we go and now can you see they're both going blue red blue red so now hopefully they're going to be talking with each other and they will begin to pair so as you can see now they're both paired up it took quite a while to pair at that time but from now on once they're paired it should be quicker to do from now on so all we have to do now is plug this into the headphone jack of the TV and then we will hear it coming through the headphones so I'm just going to take the TV off mute now you will see when I plug in the Bluetooth transmitter that it will then the sound will come away from the TV and start coming through the headphones so right now the sounds coming through the TV let's bring this camera over behind the TV right so on this particular TV I've got the headphone jack just here so all we do is get your little Bluetooth transmitter and plug it in there now you can see the sounds gone away from the TV and if you have a listen on here they're now coming through here and obviously you can control the volume and stuff via the TV and their headphones here so that's our full meal and if you want it a little bit louder just put it louder coming out the TV that's it now the only way to get the sound coming back through the TV again is to actually unplug the Bluetooth transmitter even if we were to turn off the headphones like I'm gonna do now so they're now off there's still no sound coming through the TV it's only gonna work once we unplug this here and there you go you can see the sound comes through there now so let's just turn this off Veronica even if we were to leave that plugged in there it will still cut the sound to the TV even though this is now off now you get about seven hours use out of these bluetooth connectors before the battery dies but what you can do is if you're going to be using them a lot you can just plug it into the USB port on your TV because most of your TVs will have a USB port so you can actually charge it and use it at the same time so now you see the red lights on and it's charging up every time the TV's on and you get these leads supplied with the Bluetooth transmitter now the next time we go to connect up it will work a lot quicker so let's say now it's the next night and again you want to use your Bluetooth headphones because let's say your partner's asleep and you don't want to wake them up while watching TV so let's now turn this one on here again this time we only have to hold it on for a couple of seconds till the blue light comes on so that's on there now and then again we hold this one on for a couple of seconds and now hopefully that should sync up now straight away okay so that looks to me as if it's synced up so again let's take it off mute plug it into the TV just to double-check it swipe in here her career sadly but then taken over by Lauren Kieffer and there you go see country so here I sit and then when you're finished just take it out and it's back on the TV again okay so that's it nice and straightforward that's how you connect up your Bluetooth headphones to your TV even if your TV doesn't have Bluetooth alright thanks for watching please give it a thumbs up if you liked it and please subscribe for more how-to videos take care bye now

me too much of the oneplus wireless Bluetooth earbuds the version 1 and the version 2 in fact if you look at this it's almost identically the soft touch plastic that we have and even looks this is also magnetic so looks like they were inspired by them but luckily in terms of pricing they were not inspired because 1 plus bats cost almost two and a half - about three times compared to this one and this is again magnetic on this one but I like the fact that this magnetic connection is just not for name sake this has value in fact to shut off your buds you just do it like this and they're off and to switch it on you just open it trying to connect to your produce a smartphone or whatever and if it's the first time you are doing you should just remove it like this it automatically gets into the pairing mode so it's very easy and to be fair guys I tested this one with three different devices I was actually retesting this pixel three except for Android ten so I use this a lot I would say 70% of the time with this one but I also tested it with iPad pro to see how it works with iOS and even with the real me Eckstein and in terms of connection I did not have a problem and the good thing is that these are actually Bluetooth five so in terms of the a signal that the signal strength was actually really good in fact if I could move beyond this room also to the next room it did not disconnect so the signal strength was very strong with pixel I took a lot of calls even when I was in other rooms I did not have any sure now again now you wear these like this and you put it in your gear like this and the microphone is also over here let me actually first give you a physical overview then we continue and here as you can see we have LED light with applause and stuff if you open this it will try to connect and if it's connected will go and blue as as you can see it's connected right now but you just put it like this black back it'll say red and it just disconnects is and here we have the physical buttons plus and minus for the volume and you also have our logo which we use to pause and already say replay the music pause and play and if you hold it for more than two seconds what I notice is the activates Google assistance so that is there and here we have the microUSB port we using which you charge and really cream startled you get about 12 hours of battery life I simply could not test it there wasn't I didn't listen to it and you can see for that long but I would say the battery life is really good on this one and it can last for a long long time but in the last five days I had to charge it only once and they also claim that this supports sort of fast charging and fast charging and nothing is specified what is the voltage so I was charging it to the normal 5 volt 2 ampere charger that we are getting and a charge fine with that one so that's regarding the charting I don't have a problem and the microphone guys is also integrated in this one so as I was talking and if you notice this area again is that shot plastic so gives you that rubber soft rubber feel so it's very comfortable to wear like this and you can just keep it like this and as it's very light you don't even feel it there so in that way I would say it's very comfortable and so now let's talk about the microphone because I did take a lot of calls with this one and I have to say in terms of the microphone quality they have done a very good job and I took a lot of calls with this one guys and none of the other parties complained that my calls were muddied or anything so the microphone that they have put fortunately is a very good quality one and you just pull it like this it connects so that's not a problem so let me actually show you right now I'm wearing it as you can see and I'll just start this music and I can hear it but if I just take it out and put it that like this it will dispose the music and this will switch off so I like that functionality you just put it like this and it's off and you just pull it pull this and it's switched on and connects automatically to the last device and in fact in terms of connectivity also I did not have a problem as I mentioned the three different devices that I've connected and if you have Bluetooth five then the range is also really good on this one so that's what I have noticed you just take this out and it's very comfortable to wear and really also claims that these are sort of sweat the proof splash proof so if you do workouts and stuff also they should actually survive now let's talk about the sound quality because I feel that's the most important thing on a year phone and really claims that these actually have 11.2 mm driver this is the same driver almost the same size as the real meter buds too wide once hence I feel the basic quality is definitely a lot more emphasized and it has that punchy sort of pace which most of you would like so definitely the bass is elevated when the bass is there you do feel that but it's done in a good way it's not overpowering or it does not become so or powering that the don't get diluted now if we talk about the mid-tones there those are the vocals and let's say the people who are singing those are the mid-tones and here also I would say it's done pretty good but it could have been slightly better so if I have to read for bass if a flow rate adulterated nine out of ten but for the mid-tones I would rate it 8.5 out of 10 now if we move to the highs these are the high tones shimmer here I would say my bias will come because I like your force that have slightly more treble emphases like JBL generally have that so that slight spark was missing but some people feel that if you have that excessive so what is a treble it's a little bit tiring to the years so I will take the treble tones are good enough but again if you want that extra sparkle you won't find so in terms of treble tones I would rate it 8 out of 10 so overall if I have to talk just about the sound quality with this one I would say I would rate it 8.5 out of 10 but overall if you look at these earphones the build quality is good you have these magnetic connectors that actually work very easily switches on and off automatically pace to the last form and also the microphone quality that is good and even the battery life is actually really good and they actually feel premium in fact I would say if the color was black you and they don't have that are or logo over here you actually mistake this one what the one plus here but sir well this yeah was that do cost a lot more so overall I would say they are actually really good but they are two minor constant I have noticed with this one again these are sort of quibbles I would say the first con is that this one the charging port is still a microUSB port not a USB type-c port and the second thing is that again this only comes as of now I know is only in this yellow color which is actually a little bit too loud for my taste and you have that yellow accent almost everywhere on these earphones so these are minor to quibbles but apart from that overall I would say if you look at the sound quality the comfort the goods microphone and also the battery life that you are getting then I would say overall I like it considering the price point of about eighteen hundred rupees I would rate it almost about nine out of ten so before we conclude I completely forgot to mention one thing when I was watching some shows on my iPad Pro and I was connected wired this one I noticed that there was a sync delay between the video and the audio the audio was getting on the sea-air phones I was split second later and I noticed that so that is something you have to note but I noticed that issue with most budget oriented earphones and this one also has that and many of you have also asked me to actually compare this one with the me neck Bluetooth the earphone so what I've done is these guys have just ordered it here you can see the screenshot and when I get it hopefully by next week or so I will do a comparison with this one and see which one is better and let's also put in the oneplus versus a bullet two wireless earphones because in terms of looks these are almost identical if these were black you might and if we don't have that our logo over here you might mistake this one for the oneplus bullet a Toria phones so once I get the me bluetooth what is a neck band earphones will do a comparison with this one so again stay tuned for that anyways guys that's it for now thanks for watching this is Ranjit and I hope to see you in my next video take care guys

wireless|oneplus z wireless|oneplus z wireless india|oneplus z vs relame|geekyranjit,2020-10-07 10:22:45.248599, hi guys this is Ranjith and in this video let's do the review of this one plus Z farlis your phone so I'm actually varying then and quite a few of you have asked me to actually take this outside which is this from what you say oneplus website already took it out here is it I'll show you this and comes inside this one this back here and if you open here we also have accessory box and some paperwork so you also get this USB type-c cable with this one and some extra steps of earbuds as you can see so that's what you get so two pairs of extra ones and one is sort of pretty attached so total of three that you are getting and always do know it's priced at two thousand rupees I feel the packaging is well done but one thing that is missing is that we don't get any pouch or anything in that and let me just close it close this one and give you an idea on the back it says that this has of wrap charge so if you are having the new one plus devices that have that wrap charge you can actually do fast charging with this one and they claim ten minutes of that will give you about 10 hours of battery life and in terms of battery life let's say it's long battery life over here the battery life is actually really good they claim about 20 hours of battery life guys I started testing it yesterday I have watched about two movies and also finished about 45 minutes of listening to music and it was hovering around about 79% so the battery life is really good and it has that magnetic control it says just like earlier oneplus what do you say the bullet while this here phone just like the same these are magnetic and on of and on off is via that so if you just open it up it switches on so that's what it is and they also say waterproof it's not completely waterproof I would say these are sort of sweat resistant so that's nice if you're even doing exercise and stuff a little bit of sweat or water splashes it should be fine and we also have a quick switch and we have the low latency mode I will talk about this one this is interesting they say that this is special mode that will work only with oneplus smartphones but I don't have the latest one class 8 devices so I tested it with what do you say the Samsung one and even a red my smartphone and I feel is actually good on this one so let's talk about it first let me actually show you these and I'll also compare it with this what do you say real me buds Wireless because these are not just about 200 rupees less than this one I also had it and many of you were asking me how does it compare so I'll also talk about that one but first let's look at this one and just like the original one Plus these are actually good this is made up of soft rubber and it feels very nice and premium we also have a select switch on and there's not a power on/off I would say this for switching between other devices I'll talk about this one later and we have the USB type-c port again this one supports fast charging so that's actually nice and again we have a couple of controllers over here plus or minus for volume and if you want to take on end calls you have to use this one and it has an integrated microphone also and I would say let's first start out talking about the microphone and I would say the microphone quality is actually very good on this one others did not complain about the microphone and I had I took actually calls over about 25 minutes with this one and the other party's never complained so in that department is actually really good no issues regarding the microphone and even the Bluetooth range is good even when my smartphone was here and I was in other room moving around while taking calls never had an issue of disconnection so that way it is nice also the ear tips I would say as I told you these are magnetic so if you open it switches on and off and the here tips are also very nice and I would say in terms of comfort these are actually very very helpful table so in that area also you don't have to worry I was wearing it continuously for hours couple of hours as probably I've watched a couple of movies with this one and never hurt it so very comfortable in terms of that and I would definitely say for 2000 rupees these are good ones and in fact I also have the original low one plus bullet violence if you guys recall this was priced at 6000 rupees and if you look at it almost the same in fact this one is actually thicker on these new ones I feel that's because of the extended battery life but for this one for 6000 rupees and like that the sound signature also I would say of the new one is far better than the original ones that were for 6000 now let's talk about what do you say other aspects of this one the Bluetooth range is good the charging speed is actually very fast and the battery life is also good and the microphone is also good so for a person who mostly uses this want to take calls and stuff like that that is good also before I'll talk about the sound quality and all these things let me also talk about the switching we have this button for quick switching and let me actually show you it's actually paired with two devices right now this is my s 20 plus that's gonna be shown over here it is there and also I'll bring the show me this was the redmi note this also aren't paid so let me do one thing let's just open this up and it should connect we have a LED light to this one as you can see it's connected now it's connected and it also shows you the battery life percentage right now it's at a peepers and as I've told you the battery life is kind of fake on this one it goes on and on and on so that way it's very good now as you see if we have one physical switch over here and if you hold it for three seconds you can pair it with the new device but I have it was already paired to this one also this red me phone and if I just double tap this one it's going to disconnect from this one and hopefully it should connect to this one oops and as you can see it's connecting so it takes about one one and a half seconds so it's very easy to switch between the devices by just pressing again as you can see it's connected to this ready phone let me just double click this and it should switch back to this galaxy s2 ne+ and as you can see within the second it does and I don't have the latest of 1+8 devices it's claims that the switching will be even faster it's of oneplus device so that way I like this convenient switch let me just take this out now another thing is that about latency I feel the latency is controlled very well on this one as I've told even while I was watching videos and stuff some of the Bluetooth headsets you get the lip synching issue here that was not the case I watch two movies on Netflix and was a lot of YouTube videos and they're also I did not have that latency issue so in that way they have done a good job but as the box says with specifically oneplus devices it has a special mode to even reduce the latency so but in general mode with this galaxy s 20 plus I do not have an issue of latency so that's nice so in these aspects it's actually really good but now let's talk about how's the sound quality on this one and here I have mixed feelings first let's talk about the good things if you talk about the higher tones here I would say 1 plus deck a very good job in fact the high tones have a lot of clarity on this one I would give it as high as 9 out of 10 and in terms of mid tones and the vocals also here I would say it was very very done and I would rate it again very high of about 9 out of 10 lot of clarity and vocals and the high tones and also in terms of soundstage I would say oneplus has improved the soundstage quite a bit I could easily distinguish the instruments as they're coming from this side that side or when I was watching movies I couldn't distinguish easily where the bullets are flying so that way the sound State is also very good but now when it comes to bass I would say bass is there don't get me wrong it's not like the bass is not there but if you are a sort of a person who likes a bass and many of the Indians do like that a enhanced bass here I felt it was slightly lacking don't get me wrong it's not like the bass is completely not there or anything like that but I felt that the bass was slightly lacking on this one so in terms of bass I would cut down some points and I would rate it about six point five out of ten so overall a very good headset and in terms of music also I'd really enjoy that but I did feel when watching movies and a lot of music tracks that the bass was slightly less then typically what we as Indians like so that was in terms of sound I would say and overall I would say I really like it for the fast-charging the microphone quality is really good so if you have that kind of a person for whom those are high priorities then I would certainly say that you like it now if I have to compare with this real me buds wireless I would say these sell for 1800 rupees and in fact if you look at it what are very similar in terms of obviously this doesn't have the USB type-c port this has the regular micro USB and doesn't support as fast charging as this one not the battery as good but in terms of sound signature I would say the overall sound signature for music was better on this really buds because of that bass the bass gave a lot of depth so in that area I would say if you are a person who likes a little bit of extra bass in music you might prefer the real me over the one class but anyways overall I would say now at the price point of about two thousand rupees if you are looking for a good Bluetooth headset and music might not be your highest priority then I can certainly recommend this one because the sound signature has improved quite a bit the microphone quality is very good it has that insane battery life and that super fast charging so anyways what do you guys feel about this one plus Z wireless earphones - let me know in the comment section below and if you guys are still not subscribed to my youtube channel hit that subscribe button anyways guys that's it for now thanks for watching this is Ranjit and I hope to see you in my next video

soundlink 2 HeadPhones|audio|headphones|speakers,2020-10-07 10:22:45.248622, everyone Jimmy would Jim's preview room both just released some new over-the-ear headphones these sound true twos are the wired models while these sound link twos which I have here are the wireless both a complete redesign at least aesthetically having them a lot less bulky compared to last year's model now pricing is on your screen with these sound link twos here that I personally paid for at the retail price of $279 and also through up there on the screen for another $20 you can get the wired but one of the best if not the best in active noise-cancelling performance the bose qc25 for more recent updated pricing of course click on the link in the video description below just in case you're watching this later in the year again I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room be sure to subscribe and follow me on Facebook Twitter or Instagram for more reviews like this so I'm here to help you make your purchase decision welcome everyone to jim's review room going over the physical features first this is not a direct comparison video to the qc25 but i gotta say the selling tool looks and feels almost like them the same quality are placed into the selling twos with the foam band line with Alcantara a top has leather though and the arms extending down are reinforced with aluminum rails in BOCES fashion it feels like subtle simple and refined luxury but the quality is there to do my stress test nothing broke no seams were exposed everything really stayed together perfectly fine you do hear a little bit of play but nothing of concern at all overall very well put together now moving down to the air cups they do turn a full 90 degrees for stowing and they do pivot enough to fit most heads the unfortunately don't fold inward for easier stowing for travelers the supplied carrying case footprint isn't that large but it is something to take into consideration a little bit over 50% of the case is covered in fabric with the rest a soft leather inside this is felt lined with a neoprene carrying pouch for your supplied cables not worn them a little bit later but heading back to the ear cups here each side is labeled for easy channel identification the ear pads are just plush for long-term wearing but I'll discuss that in my comfort test shortly as for connections although this is a wireless pair of headphones the left side offers not a three and a half but a two and a half millimeter input and the cord provided is about three feet and 10 inches long just enough to keep your phone in your pocket the cord and input does not have a locking mechanism however attempting to simulate a yank or pull on the cord the water stays in very very well on the right side volume up and down with pause and play in the sensor which are very easy to reach a identify fiscally and the same sensor button can also be used to accept phone calls which I'll demonstrate real briefly here oh I am testing out my um these headphones uh-huh and I got you on the fundamental test in many ways how do I sound how does it sound so far it's not like there's parking on your phone oh that clear huh yeah how nice and did you hear Lynn in the background you hear screaming oh now I'm going to say do you hear an echo or any kind of static or anything like that no okay hey clear perfect alright let me stop the recording real quick several less features are the on and off switch on the side that also provides voice prompts on which devices you're connected to and the percentage of battery life remaining which is very useful in speaking of batteries the microUSB port is located on the bottom and Bose does a phenomenal job with offering quick charging 15 minutes gives you two hours of use while a fully charging the headphones from a dead battery will take you about three hours and you get 15 hours of playback better life is decent when I compared this to some of the other competitors out there other headphones were around 13 to 15 hours in battery life but as we're comforts these are still the lightest pair of headphones that I ever tested they weigh exactly the same as the qc25 at just 6.9 ounces or 192 grams and because they're so lightweight the minimal cushions and designs still works fine wearing these for three hours straight with no problems and it didn't have issues with the headphones clamping too hard on the jawline overall very comfortable as for sound leaking there is a bit though at higher volumes not too bad but compared to other headphones I've tried the sounding twos do leak slightly a bit more but to the part that you've been waiting for the sound test overall similar to the other Bose products they've always provided clean balanced audio right out the box is selling to provides a characteristic that leaned towards mainstream users not audio files in my belief some very much prefer the sound signature as it relatively remains flat not too strong on bass not too strong in the high notes either but it's far from underwhelming as well the selling tools in my experience provides a neutral tone that works for many genres more so for classical rock and/or other heavier vocal and string focused music the selling to's does work good for EDM hip hop and rap but those who listen to those generals I would think would favor a bit more bass to have that constant 808 beat in the background stand out a bit more but the sounding - offers clear sound virtually no distortion in its quality and listening to these for those three hours straight I had no listening fatigue whatsoever there's just enough bass to be enjoyed in general vocals are just enough Ford and highs are not singing in ear ringing for the price range the soundstage is decent with hearing Audio separation but distance isn't as well distinguished as some of the other high-end headphones on the market overall if you're looking for a great well-rounded audio quality a great build quality that's super lightweight the sounding tubes are a great choice if you're looking for a better spatial sound deeper bass or something with a bit more bass boost there's definitely others out there as for the price let me know what you think below would you be willing to shell out just $20 more and go wired with the qc25 for the amazing active noise-cancelling features I'm really curious about that so I hope this review helped you in some way remember to subscribe and add me on social media at Jim's review room on either Facebook Twitter or Instagram again I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room you guys take care and I'll see in the next one bye you

10:22:45.248669, hey everyone Jimmy when Jim's review room welcome back to another one of my videos today we're checking out the Jabra elite 65 t truly wireless earphones has always been transparent with you guys jarba did send this as a reviewing it for us to test out for you guys as always we're gonna be unbiased here please watch the entire video for both pros and cons prices are on your screen but I'll leave my affiliate links down in that video description below click on those links as they'll give you the most updated prices in real time you never know when these things might go on sale again I'm Jimmy wood Jim's review room and I'm here to help you make that purchase decision welcome everyone to another review [Music] going over the physical features first these things are small and discreet for truly wireless earphones is pretty cool if you guys look at the video right now you can notice that it doesn't stick past my ears some truly wireless earphones sometimes they look a little bit gargantuan kind of unsightly as well if you were to compare this as reference then be you know eh Andy Samsung icon X 2018 edition looks pretty similar in size no these are all plastic they're not made of metal they have this titanium paint finish which I think looks really good here but overall the finish is very much quality made well crafted in the buns are very clicky very tactile here and also very easy to reach now these are IP X 55 rated which means that it can take light water jet sprays here the office with my little spray bottle we didn't spray the crap on this thing and drench them and they're still working perfectly fine now as for comfort these feel absolutely great the three ear tips included in the retail package works perfectly fine during running walking of course working here at the office they've never fallen out of my ears I can wear this all day with no wind fatigue whatsoever now going back to the ear tips they provide excellent passive noise isolation you put these under the blocks on a lot of your environments forget about active noise canceling also there's a very minimal sound leaking at 50 to 60 percent amount which was more comfortable casual listening I even bumped this up to about 80 percent amount which is starting to get loud for us for these 65 T's and just testing this here in the office barely anyone could hear discern what I was listening to awesome performance they're now jumping into Bluetooth quality this is one of the very few truly wireless earphones that finally has Bluetooth 5.0 which is absolutely great for battery life signal reception etc now the test is posting myself here at the office with my samsung s A+ which does feature Bluetooth 5.0 and I was expecting a little bit more range basically but I did get 88 linear feet before these signals start to crack up now that is excellent if you're in the gym if you're walking throughout your house it's gonna be no problem whatsoever eighty-eight linear feet is typically on the high-end Bluetooth signal range but because go to 5.0 I was expecting a little bit more but on that for most if not all average consumers idiot linear feed through a wall or two here at the office again it did but not only did absolutely great moving on here still sticking with Bluetooth signal I did test this with movies a lot of truly wireless earphones do have some kind of syncing issue where you hear the audio but then the lips on YouTube or Netflix is just going and flapping away I did test this again with my samsung phone here no problem with Netflix no plan with YouTube it is in sync one of the very few truly wireless earphones that has that feature or has that ability now jumping into battery life these do claim up to five hours with a battery that's pretty much on the average of truly wireless earphones it does come with a charging case you basically stick your earphones in here when you're not using them you stow them away and while they're put a layer stowed away they do recharge they go which is fabulous which most truly around these earphones do again you get five hours on the earphones in themselves we tested this at 50% volume and actually got six hours and 45 minutes from full to debt again excellent in that regards the case itself does offer two full charges so in theory this gives you a full 15 hours if you need it quick recharging I'll basically put those stats on the screen pause if you need to if I'm going a little too fast next up I want to talk about the speakerphone phone call performance and quality there's four built-in microphones into these earphones altogether this is a first I believe for truly wireless earphones this is something that Jabra it's really promoting here it does pick up your voice crystal-clear very audible it's one of the best if not the best in microphone quality the only issue there the only caveat it picks up everything around you it's someone that's ten feet away maybe a car driving down the road there me walking through doors to leave the building here it's all picked up through the microphone in a very loud audible fashion I guess you can say now if you're in a quiet environment this thing works exceptionally well again it's one of the best now the reason why has four microphones all together on these earbuds it's not only just for speakerphone quality it's because i've the very first truly Wireless earphones to feature Alexa built-in I'm gonna call her Alexa from here on out so that way I don't activate your speakers at home but using this feature it's very similar to let's say Google assistant or Siri on your smart phones those assistants works great the commands weren't great the only issue that I found here when I did use Alexa is there was a slight delay the Alexa feature was a little bit longer it took like an additional second or two and as the even has an average consumer it's something that you will notice I wish it was a little bit more streamlined or a little bit more intuitive or faster now touching base on audio these do get loud and I had to turn it up to about 80% Vaughn for the average consumer for most people actually eighty percent is not bad at all and this will be loud for you some people might listen to it a little bit louder some people may be a little bit lower now comparing to some of the competition like DJ bird runs or the Bose sound sport fries those that usually about 60 maybe the 70% vine is equivalent in loudest at 80% for these 65 C's getting into bass these are more of a neutral level equivalent to the B note e8 so these do not thump or a deep and resonating like DJ Verve runs but I very much appreciated these because they are more of a neutral sound profile there's enough bump or thump that is enough for most general is very evenly well played it does not distort or basically hinder the mid-range the j-bert runs are very hard hitting the bose sound support fries are very deep and resonating cleaner based in the j-bird runs but compared to these these are more compared to those other ones are a little bit more neutral now jumping into the mid-range this is where it does shine here very good quality very good clean audio it doesn't have the same sound stage as the two other ones I have mentioned again the j-bert runs or the bean or a vivo sound sport freeze that is but compared to let's say these Samsung I can X 2018 edition the drawbar 65 T's do beat them they're the mid-range also does provide more of a neutral sound profile not overly bright it's not necessarily Reece as well again for a neutral profile the high frequencies were never ear ringing ear tinny and never gave me listening fatigue no jumping into the application it's pretty much straightforward pretty decent here you can adjust which assistant that you want whether it be Alexa again I don't want to activate your speakers that's why I'm calling her Alexa but there's also a Google assistant in Siri built-in as well you do have an equalizer built-in which does slightly tune the audio characteristics a bit it wasn't as sensitive as the jaybird runs but compared to a lot of the other competitors either competitors don't even offer equalizer built-in and if they do it's very minut here you don't really get a audio response so you don't have much changes also you have on here is the here through option or feature you basically can turn on the microphones and have audio in your environment pump into your ear so that we can hear your surroundings just for safety or just for caution as well so overall I highly recommend the dropper elite 65 tease the reason being I think they look great they're very much comfortable the price point is very much reasonable for truly wireless earphones having the Alexa feature is a huge benefit a huge perk I did wish that it would function a little bit faster but just having it in general is something very much different compared to the competition out there the audio signature I believe was very good here it's a little more a flatter profile that's not a bad thing it just depends on your preference alright folks so

bumi or something that's very nicely done and now if you talk about the mid-tones where you have a lot of vocals and stuff here also I feel they did a good job the vocals are very clear so it's great to listen to a lot of songs that have a lot of vocals now coming to the high tones I would say the high tones are very produced but they could have been slightly better but nevertheless considering the price point of these one and how compact they are I would say in terms of sound signature for the price I would give them nine out of ten now these are are truly Valis your birds they work on bluetooth bluetooth five I might restrict this with actually three different Android phones and they paid without any issues so in terms of the Bluetooth range also it was fine even when I moved to the second room it was intact it do not lose the connections so it's difficult to the range I would say if you move from the second one room to the second room it will sound fine but maybe if you don't move to the third room it might disconnect but that's the normal thing that we have read Bluetooth headsets now in terms of comfort also they are actually really really comfortable and almost varied that they were just far out of my ears I didn't do any chalking or anything with this one as you can see I'm just wearing it and if we just wear it like this and Target and they've stayed secure I didn't listen to it continuously but I must have listened to it more than one when I know how fast continuously I didn't never fell out of my guess I don't know how good it will be for jogging and stuff like that but for regular use of your in your home and stuff they won't just fall out of your ears now moving to the battery life battery life strictly average understand these are very small as you can see and they have to house a complete battery in that I would say the battery life is what Xiaomi is sort of advertising that's about three and a half to about for us but the good thing is that this case also acts as the charge and this is how you actually charge it and you can put this back and this and we have some red LED lights that denotes if it's charging and it can charge almost three times with this case so these are the good things about this one now let's prove to some of the cons that I have the first con that I have is regarding the build quality of the case from the looks of it it looks fine but one thing that what I've noticed is the opening case of this one is very very verbally and it is actually clicking quite a bit as of now I don't know how well it will hold over time so this is my biggest concern about this one it's really really wobbly so this might I am just a little bit fearful after two three months this might just come out and you really need this case for it to fur so that's one of my biggest concerns that I have with this one there's one area where I do not like these any dots and like most of the Bluetooth headsets you can also take voice calls with this one and you can do that even this a dot it has a microphone but I feel the microphone quality is simply not that great on this one because most of the times when I was taking cellular calls with this one connected to my smartphone most people complained that the call quality was simply not that great so that is something that you have to keep in mind now coming to another thing this is not specific to this for ordered but its availability in India as of now Xiaomi hasn't officially launched this one in India so what you have to do is you have to import it from China or buy it from Amazon I would strictly not suggest you to buy it from Amazon because I paid almost three thousand nine hundred rupees for this one and for that price I would say it's really expensive but if you are able to get it for 1500 or be seventeen eighteen hundred rupees then I would say it's a great pair of earphones and I hope Xiaomi officially launches this one India in China it's selling for around thousand bucks I would say and India I've taken even launched it for 1200 or even let's say 1500 bucks then it would be a great deal overall I would say really good pair of Valis Sega bats and certainly at this price point if you are able to get it around 1500 1600 apiece they are sort of a steal but I just hope that Xiaomi launches this one officially in time so guys that's it for now for this review and if you guys are still not subscribed to my youtube channel hit that subscribe button this'll ranjit and I hope to see you in my next video take care guys"

#Razer #Hammerhead #TrueWireless #GamingBuds",28,642192,1022.0,10419.0,583.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-_IVYQuPzmo/hqdefault.jpg,razer|hammerhead|true|wireless|earbuds|gaming|bluetooth|pc|apple|android|mobile|steam|mic|test|review|bass|beats,2020-10-07 10:22:45.248820, so today's video is sponsored by the company minimal case now I've always been curious to why people go out and buy the latest greatest sleek looking design phones only to cover them up with those huge bulky cases so that's where the company minimal case comes in now they offer cases for the newest phones while keeping the phone looking the way it was intended to look now my personal favorite is the transparent case which basically looks like you don't have a case at all and that's the one that I have on my pixel for it so but they also offer colors in frosted white frosted black and matte black so there's no flashy colors they try to keep it simple which is the overall idea behind their cases now if you go to their site and use the code game ski you can save 25% off I'm also gonna put a link in the description that if you use that it will automatically apply the discount when you go to checkout but I'd like to thank minimal case for sponsoring today's video all right guys so today we're gonna look at a pair of truly wireless earbuds from the company razor that's right the gaming company razor has now entered the truly wireless market and the pair we're gonna look at is the Razer hammerhead true Wireless so to start with these armed $99 and they actually have the ear pod style design but they are offering some features that make these different than your normal truly wireless earbuds but let's go ahead and check out some of the specs and what comes inside the box now the first thing I want to point out is it does have bluetooth 5.0 so as far as lag and latency with watching videos I didn't experience anything there but the huge thing about these is it has a gaming mode which switches into like ultra-low latency so as far as PC gaming and mobile gaming it's going to cut down on you having like hardly any lag at all it says like 60 milliseconds and anybody that games knows how important that is the IP X rating is ipx4 I don't know why there's a pattern of this lately but IP x4 is at the lower end of the spectrum so yeah it's fun for rain and sweat and stuff like that but as far as getting it anywhere near where you may drop them into water you don't want to do that but inside the box you're getting what they call a silicone ear sleeve so it's not a silicone ear tip but I think it's more people that want to go out and run and stuff like that and may have an issue with ear buds kind of bouncing or moving around in their ears this just helps keep it more secure but for me personally I prefer using these without the little sleeve now it also has a little strap that you can connect to the case that way if you don't want to throw it in your pocket or if you just wanted to use it to loop around something on your bag you have that option and so the charging cable they included is a really nice fabric USBC cable this is where some people are going to have an issue with these and I completely get it the battery life on these individually are around three hours that is really really low and then with the charging case you're only gonna get around 16 hours of use so as far as battery life that's some of the lowest that I've seen in truly wireless earbuds now I don't know if the battery life is being affected because of the ultra-low latency mode that they have or the fact that the case of these is extremely small so you can't really fit a large battery in these there's no excuse it's a very small battery now the case on these like I said is a very small case it's easy to throw in your pocket or your bag and just kind of forget that it's in there you have a single indicator light on the front and then you have your USB C charging input on the back now the earbud design like I said is very similar to the air pod style not only because it has the stem design but also the earbud part itself has the exact same look as air pods so if you're already familiar with how those fit you will automatically kind of feel comfortable with these right off the bat now they are using custom 13 millimeter drivers which thirteen millimeter drivers in an earbud is pretty large the one thing I'm sad to say right off the bat is they didn't use RGB lighting I know that sounds like a minor complaint but most of the time when I'm buying Razer products I really like to have that little bit of glow or at least maybe that little bit of option of changing colors and I think it would have been a nice touch here now as far as your controls go these do use touch controls which controls everything but volume and again same complain as always I really wish companies would use volume control being able to just do it on the earbud themselves I mean you can summons your smart sistent it's just not always convenient then the other thing that they added in these is being able to switch them into gaming mode which then immediately puts them into ultra-low latency mode which is very vital when you're playing games now that's with your mobile device it's with the PC and that's the convenience of these I believe I think the fact that they don't have any latency with playing PC games and then switching over if you're a mobile gamer as well it just makes it really convenient but to switch them you tap your earbud three times and you hold it on that third until you hear it say that it's switching it in a gaming mode and to be able to switch it back you just do the exact same thing now the mics on these are actually very decent again that's important for gaming as well but I think that also is the reason they go for the ipx4 water-resistant because if it is anything higher it has to have more coding which ultimately would affect the microphone but you guys can be a judge by listening to a test here all right guys so here is a mic test using the Razer hammerhead true Wireless again I think this might picks up very very well and you can hear the details on my voice clearly and so here is the microphone with a crowd noise being played in the background so you can kind of get an idea of what it would sound like if you're using these in public so now let's get into the sound and before I get into the sound I want to go ahead and touch on the volume these get plenty loud especially on PC but even with mobile devices I didn't have any issue with thinking these needed to be louder and the other surprising thing is I found that even though these are the kind of just kind of sit in your ear I got a better seal with these than I have with others that have this similar style so the sound is surprisingly very clear while still having razor's usual like impactful bass but it does feel like Razer cleaned up the bass a little bit because it's not as sloppy as it is with some of their headsets now I'm not saying their base in general is sloppy but they usually don't focus on tightening it up and these have more of a tighter impact hit which is great for gunshots explosions and everything like that these are really good for watching movies just as long as your movie isn't over three hours long now when it comes to treble the treble is bare detail-oriented I don't feel like it's pushed to that point of almost being too bright or too harsh it kind of sits right back about where the base does where they definitely have their presence but they're not at the point where they feel like they're just trying to do too much they're not trying to take over they're letting the mids do what they need to do this is a really nice overall balance truly wireless earbud but balanced in a way where it's like still turned up in balance it's not flat by any means now the one frequency I feel like they just really focused a lot on here and it really is the most important frequency when you're playing games are the mids the mids as far as singers go it always feels like they're right there in front of you but with playing games you hear dialogue very well you hear footsteps really well everything is tuned in a way to bring out those subtle sounds I think this is what separates this product from other truly wireless earbuds you can really tell that this is focused on gaming but does an excellent job with music as well so as far as my cons with these I think the battery life being as low as it is is going to affect how people will approach these I mean three hours for some just is not gonna cut it the a px4 rating is another thing that just kind of makes some people leery about using these in certain environments and this may just be me but I really wish they would have included RGB lighting I mean I know some people don't like RGB but razors always been associated with that and so just to have your earbuds have that option would have been nice but overall for a hundred dollars this is an excellent media truly Wireless earbud it works great for games movies music sounds fantastic the soundstage sounds a little bit more open because you don't have the seal of silicon ear buds it's not perfect by any means but it definitely ticks a lot of the boxes especially if you're somebody that's into gaming but guys this is my review of the Razer hammerhead true Wireless thank you so much for checking out this video thank you so much for checking out all the other videos and as always make sure to stay tuned for more

guys it's Kristin so in today's video I'm gonna show you how you can connect your wireless headphones to pretty much any TV even if it doesn't have Bluetooth enabled or anything like that so now I ran into this problem where I started googling and doing a lot of research on how I could figure out a way to get my older TV connected to my wireless headphones and the reason for that is because my boyfriend works really early so he goes to bed early I work kind of later in the day so I go to bed later but I always want to watch TV cuz I'm not tired but then I'm always keeping him awake and so I was like there's got to be a way for me to like be able to hear the TV but not have him awake so I started doing a bunch of research and I found this cool device that allows you to connect anything any headphones that are wireless to a TV that maybe doesn't have the capability of like Bluetooth or Wireless anything like that so let me show you what I'm using and how to set it up before we jump any further into the video if you guys are new please subscribe and then don't forget to hit the bell so you're notified when I upload a new video all right so this is the little device that I bought so it's super tiny and it comes with a cord to charge this so this thing was like 23 bucks or 24 or something like that now if you look at the back of your TV some mines on the bottom sometimes it's on the side up here but on the bottom this cord this little hole right there that's for our aux and that's what we're gonna put this so I'm gonna put this right in there there we go and then it just sort of hangs down but that's what we're putting it right in there so one downside of this for this particular thing with the TV is that this is super short like it's really tiny if you're using this for something else it's fine but like for TV this really needs to be longer so on the back side and the side you can see there's like a power button so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna try to show this to you I'm gonna hold this down and you should start seeing a blue and red light flashing so you want to keep holding until you see blue and red now I'm gonna get my wireless headphones so now I've got my wireless headphones and I'm gonna hold this down until we see a blue and red light as well there we go so now you saw that both of them we're on and they shut off and now this is just showing blue and this one here is just flickering blue as well so they're connected so now that your headphones are connected you can be lying in bed or whatever you're doing you can have the headphones and even if the TV is like I think it was like I've tested out and I was like 15 feet away you can hear it perfectly but nobody else in the room can hear you now this does work with other devices so if you have anything else that does not have Bluetooth or wireless capabilities you can use this little transmitter so that you can connect your wireless headphones one thing I always like to include in my how-to videos is things not to do because I feel like people don't include that so then you make mistakes you know and if people give you a heads up then you can avoid those so one thing is you must have it connected to the TV like plugged into the aux cord or whatever in you know import before you try to sync it any time I tried to sync this just on its own like side-by-side it would not work and then as soon as I plugged it into the TV and synced it it worked just fine the other thing is that most TVs I mean if it's new or it may not do this but the older ones which is what I'm using this for if you leave that aux little device plugged in you'll have no audio so if you like aren't if your headphones are disconnected and you're like freaking out because the TV has no audio it's probably because you accidentally left that little you know syncing device plugged in so you do need to disconnect it when you're not using it or your TV will have no audio and lastly I know that sometimes people can forget this I did one time it does need to be charged so like it only lasts so long so if you're in the middle of watching TV and all sudden you lose all audio and maybe the lights there's no like there's no lights and stuff it's probably because you have to charge it so that's the only other thing I don't know exactly how long it lasts yet I haven't really tested it but I've been using it for probably like a month off and on and I haven't charged to yet so on it's probably gonna die soon but just those few things just want to let you guys know so that if you run into those problems you know why alright guys so that's it for today's video I hope you liked it and I hope this is helpful for you if you did like the video please give me a thumbs up also don't forget to comment below so that I know you were here and listening questions you had or if you found other devices that you thought work better also if you're new to my channel don't forget to subscribe and then hit this bell so that you're alerted when I upload a new video and I'll talk to you later

Beats Studio 3 vs Solo 3 – Wireless Headphones Comparison. Both the Beats Studio3 and Beats Solo3 are solid headphones and we know it can be hard to decide between the two so we decided to do this Beats Solo3 vs Beats Studio3 Wireless review. Both headphones offer incredible Bluetooth range and stability thanks to Apple's W1 chip. The W1 chip also allows for seamless integration with iOS and iCloud. But in terms of comfort, we give the edge to the Studio3. The Studio3 Bluetooth headphones also offer better noise cancellation with their Adaptive Noise Cancelling Technology. Finally, the Studio 3 wireless headphones also offer better audio quality than the Solo3s. On the other hand, the Beats Solo 3 Bluetooth headphones are cheaper and we see more deals on them. Next, the Solo3 wireless headphones offer better battery life at up to 48 hours on a single charge, which is pretty amazing. Lastly, the Solo3s are a little lighter and thus better for the gym than the Studio3. At the end of the day though, both of these headphones are awesome. Both of these headphones might land on the list for Best Wireless Headphones 2019 or Best Wireless On-Ear Headphones 2019. Hope you enjoyed the video.

headphones these are the bluetooth version at the 4.30 that I reviewed and really liked a while back and Sennheiser also has the 4.50 BT NC which adds active noise cancellation the 4.40 BT go for 150 dollars and I'll put a link below if you want to check out the current price or pick up a pair I really like the 4.30 so let's take a look to see if the 4.40 are worth it starting off with what's in the box besides the headphones you get an audio cable to use these as wired headphones it has a 2.5 millimeter plug on the headphone end and a standard 3.5 millimeter plug on the other you can turn and lock the audio cable to keep it from getting unplugged the audio cable doesn't have an inline mic or control so when these are plugged in they function just like normal headphones you also get a micro USB cable to charge some documentation and a fabric travel pouch the headphones are made entirely of plastic but they feel solid and well built they're lightweight but feel durable and there's no creaking in the plastic there's the Sun riser name on the top of the headband and on the inside it's lined with rubber with a small amount of padding that's okay though because these feel really lightweight and put very little pressure on the top of your head there are some hangs there logos on each side of the headband which is adjustable with clicks in each position and they can fold up too which is great if you plan to take these with you the ear cups are covered in matte plastic that is a nice feel but they do show oils from your skin not as bad as gloss plastic but you will notice some smudges the ear cups pivot up and down and will swivel left and right as I mentioned in the review of the 4.30 the ear cups are pretty big and I can see them out of the corner of my eye these also use the same leather at ear pads as the 4.30 which are extremely soft and comfortable but I'm not a fan of the narrow oval shape there's a ton of padding and they're very deep so the drivers don't press up against my ears but if you have larger ears then they fit very snug and can get pretty warm the extra cushioning and snug fit does block a lot of outside noise though I like that these make a nice seal around your ears one thing I noticed with the ear pads those how much oil they show that's not something I see on other headphones the ear pads are which is nice clamping force seems to be just right on these making a good seal and staying secure without putting too much pressure on my head these are very comfortable to wear for hours but they do get a little warm after a while all the controls are on the right ear cup from the left you have an LED indicator for power and pairing there are also voice prompts when you power arm on and make a connection and the female voice will also tell you when the battery's getting low next to that is the power button then the multifunction button you can press it in to play pause answer end a call or hold it down for 2 seconds to bring up Siri or Google now you can also slide it to fast-forward or go back a track and if you slide and hold you can also fast forward or rewind then there's your volume headphone jack micro USB port to charge and mic there are actually two mics this one and then the one in the outside of the right ear cup the mic sounds great for voice calls the caller on the other end couldn't tell I was using headphones and you can hear your voice playback as well so you won't be talking too loudly there's NFC on the left ear cup for quick pairing so if you have an NFC enabled device just tap it to the logo and it will quickly pair otherwise pairing through Bluetooth is quick you can pair two devices at once so I was able to have my tablet and phone connected at the same time and play music from each without having to pair or unpair bluetooth performance is great too I was easily able to get a solid connection from one end of my house to the other and it only dropped out when I walked outside past 50 feet these also have aptX so if you have a compatible device you'll get the best quality connection I don't have any aptX devices but I found these to sound great whether plugged in or Wireless battery life here is great as well you'll get up to 25 hours it's not as good as the 40 hours you'll get with the Skullcandy crush your wireless or the beats solo 3 but it's still better than most of the competition just like the wired version of these headphones these have a warm sound with some extra weight on the low end the bass is emphasized here but it's not overpowering and it gives a good balance with punchy kick drums these don't give you the crazy amount of bass that you can get with the skull candy crush or Wireless or the sony MDR XB 950 bt but to me these give just enough of a bump in the low end to satisfy bass lovers but not take over completely I'd recommend either of those head Bonz if you want a ton of ace but these are definitely worth a listen these have strong mids as well they're rich in clean and vocals have a good amount of presence the highs are detailed and clear but they aren't as bright as I personally like but they sound good at full blast and they don't get harsh these have a nice wide soundstage too with good stereo separation they sound great for a wide range of music whether listening to bass heavy tracks or not and they sound great for movies too the bass gets deep without distorting or drowning out the dialogue I really like the way they sound they have an accurate sound overall with rich bass that seems to be just the right amount for me and again you can get wireless headphones that have more bass but these are still really fun to listen to so that wraps it up these sound great with nice deep bass they're lightweight and they feel really well-made I like that these have NFC for quick pairing and the battery life is great too even though everything's plastic here they don't feel cheap my only nitpick with these is the oval-shaped ear cups they do feel a little cramped and get warm but they're still very comfortable there's a link in the description below if you want to pick these up and let me know if you have any

#BudgetBuds #SkullcandySesh #TrueWireless",28,545719,898.0,6788.0,205.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e5HxRb1g6gs/hqdefault.jpg,skullcandy|sesh|true|wireless|under|$50|push|indy|apple|android|airpods|bass|mic|test|review|bluetooth|headphones|earbuds,2020-10-07 10:22:45.249035, alright guys so today we're gonna check out a brand new pair of truly wireless earbuds from Skullcandy now we've already looked at the Skullcandy Indy and the Skullcandy push which are their other truly wireless earbuds but today we're gonna look at the Skullcandy sesh it's a pair that comes in at 50 dollars and if you're like me you're probably wondering what they had to cut to get it to that price so what we're gonna do is start with what's in the box and some of the features now it does have bluetooth 5.0 it is IP 55 sweat resistant and water resistant so it's not something you can submerge into water but if it gets splashed or you sweat a lot it's gonna be okay now inside of the box it comes with small medium and large silicone ear tips and it also comes with a micro USB cable alright so we're just gonna go ahead and maybe stick with that's one of the things that they were gonna cut cost on because other than that I don't understand why they used micro USB now battery life on these this is gonna be one of the things that turns a lot of people off individually they only get three hours which is really really low but if you're somebody that just uses them while you're working out or somebody that just kind of uses earbuds intermittently it won't be a huge deal but if you're somebody that likes to use earbuds pretty much your whole day this is gonna be very inconvenient you're gonna have to charge it like three times just to be able to make it through the day now the charging case will give you up to ten hours total again that is on the very low end of the spectrum so the battery life is going to be a huge turnoff for a lot of people now speaking of the case the case has four indicator lights on the front to let you know what percentage of battery life your case is left at and then on the back you have your micro USB input now on the front of the case you can see where Skullcandy is just simply written up top again the case is actually really nice now when you open the case again it's really clean and really simple and you can see that your buds now I do want to point this out because this is something I was having an issue with when you put the earbuds in the case you'd think it just kind of falls right into place and it really doesn't you put them in the case and you actually kind of have to Whittle it just a little bit to get it to fit in the case right or otherwise the tops not gonna close and it's not gonna charge them but you'll know that it doesn't go in because the lid will not close until you have it in the right way so now on to the earbuds themself as far as size this is one of the smallest pair of truly wireless earbuds I've seen which I know is contributing to the battery being so small but again I would have taken it being a little bigger just to have a little bit more battery life but I will say this these stay in your ear extremely well and again there's no weight so you can pretty much do whatever and they are not coming out but as far as controls go it is button control and it's not touch responsive the button actually responds pretty well so it's not one of those where you feel like you're jamming it into your ear and the button actually controls everything your volume your track control your smart assistant everything now if you are wanting to use one of the earbuds individually you're only able to do that with the left ear bud so another thing that's pretty important to a lot of people is the mic quality now this is one thing I will say that I was not a huge fan of now mic quality is not a huge deal to me but for those of you that it is important you might want to listen to this test alright guys so here is a mic doesn't the Skullcandy says this is also while playing a crowd noise in the background you definitely feel like this is one of the things they cut on to get to that $50.00 right there all right so now we need to get into the sound quality because honestly the Skullcandy Indy and the Skullcandy push has not really won a whole lot of people over so the sesh I was kind of expecting alright this is $50 I don't think they're really gonna do anything to improve upon their sound and I was actually surprised this sound on these yes just like in Skullcandy fashion does have plenty of bass but what's weird about it this time is it kind of has an eerie sound it kind of has a fairly open sound but don't get that confused with thinking they sound like the sound stage is really open it's not that soundstage is fairly narrow but with the bass it just seems to have a little bit of air to it which is actually kind of nice the other two frequencies though the trouble comes through really clean and really clear but the mids are the one thing I think at times just feel like they need to be pushed up just a little so it's more of a different kind of sound signature than a lot of people are going to be used to and another thing that kind of caught me off guard is usually most truly wireless earbuds when songs that are chaotic or songs that have a lot going on the bass usually just rolls through everything else well these are kind of the opposite it seemed like when there are songs where a lot of stuff's going on the bass just kind of toned down a little bit to where the mids and the treble still had presence and the bass is still there but it's not as prominent when it comes to some of those genres or some of those songs that just have a lot going on so the weird thing about the Skullcandy sesh is they're 50 bucks okay the other ones I think the Skullcandy push came out at like a hundred and thirty and then the Indies are $80 so there's a huge price drop coming in at $50 but the surprising thing here is the Skullcandy sesh is actually the better sounding truly wireless earbud out of the three it has the most volume it has the most clarity bass is good but it's definitely not overwhelming and it's just an overall pretty satisfying truly Wireless earbud to use and for $50 the sound is exactly where it needs to be especially with the holidays coming up where a lot of kids are gonna want truly wireless earbuds and then a lot of kids are gonna be drawn to companies like Skullcandy apple and you know the usual so for Skullcandy to have a $50 pair going into the holidays is actually a pretty smart move the guys that is my review of the Skullcandy sesh thank you so much for checking out this video thank you so much for checking out all the other videos and as always make sure to stay tuned for more

this video let's do the review of these me wireless headphones and these are the new super bass headphones that quite a few of you have asked me to check it out so here we have it and now have used it for some time so I'll give you my opinion what do I feel about this one but first let's look at these headphones you get this in this fancy box and it says that it has about 20 hours of playback time and I won't actually test it continuously for that long but definitely the battery life is one of the big strengths of this one and it also says that it has that 40mm driver and it is bluetooth 5 and these are the headphones it says and they look actually pretty fancy from the looks of it as you can see it looks a really really good but one thing I have noticed is that the build quality is very very plasticky and clicking and the quality of the plastic actually feels a little bit on the cheaper side but the good thing is that it has a little bit of padding over here and again even though your cups have a good cushion and as you can see it says left and right over here so that's not a problem but again I felt that the plastic quality is actually on the cheaper side so you've got to be careful with this and definitely not for rough users as it can break and these are again 40mm drivers are running to Xiaomi and if you notice the right cup actually its mount right and left over here the right cup has everything on the bottom if you go we have the micro USB port that will be used for charging we also have headphone line out so you can actually use it with audio cable that is actually provided in the box so if the battery dies you can technically use it and we actually have now three different buttons the first one is for the power on and off and other two buttons are for the volume and you can also skip tracks with that one so that's the physical overview of these headphones but let's now first talk about what do I feel about them and first let's talk about the Bluetooth range and as it's a Bluetooth 5 headset I'm happy to say that the Bluetooth range is actually really really good on this one even when I moved to the other room it did not disconnect so in fact in terms of Bluetooth range I was actually pretty impressed with this one compared to most of the budget oriented headphones in this range this one has way better Bluetooth range it also has integrated microphone so if you wear it you can actually take calls with this one and I did take quite a few calls with this one and I'm actually disappointed with the microphone of this one most times the other party said that I was not sounding clear or I was sounding a little bit on the weird side equation stuff like that so in terms of what do you say if you are primarily you buying this for taking a lot of cellular calls then I would say it's great I would read it just five out of ten if I have to rate it based on the Bluetooth cause I feel the microphone quality is simply not that great now if we talk about the battery life as I've mentioned the battery life is really really good again it will easily last for a couple of days even if you suffer heavy users Xiaomi claims about 20 hours of battery life on this one also I like the fact that you have that VAT connectivity if you really want that you can't and do that now but let's talk about the sound because I feel for headphones the biggest most important thing is the Sun but before that let's talk about the comfort also in fact in terms of comfort if you forget about the build quality as I mentioned earlier I feel these are actually pretty comfortable on a year because of this cushioning that it has it's actually very comfortable to wear and you can wear it for a couple of hours yes your gear will become slightly on the warmer side but again that's the same thing with any headphone so in terms of comfort if you forget about the build quality yes they're not sort of comfortable but now let's talk about the most important part that is sound and as the box says these are super bass and yes definitely the bass is actually highly emphasized on this one and I would say it is over emphasized a little bit and hence the bass definitely sounds a little bit on the muddier sights the bass in fact creeps into the vocals also hence the vocals also get slightly muddied I feel so in terms of I would say bass I would rate at 7.5 yes you do get that depth and if you like that heavy bass you get that bass but again the bass is not very clear and punchy so it gives that mellow feeling I would say and even the vocals get slightly drowned due to the bass and if I have to read on this one the vocals also don't sound that great the vocals sound a little bit subdued I would rate it about let's say 7 out of 10 in terms of vocals now coming to the higher tones here also I felt that these were sort of lacking and that some of the instruments that we have on the higher tones were very subdued on this one and definitely because of that the it didn't sound punchy to me in fact in terms of treble tones and stuff I would rate it just about 6.5 out of time so overall I would say if we are just talking about this sound quality on this one I would rate it just about six point five out of ten I expected a lot from this one but in terms of sound department apart from the bass it was slightly under disappointing sight for me but I mean the good thing is that it does have great battery life and also in terms of Bluetooth connectivity it was very good but still overall I would say for me the sound is the highest criteria and also the build quality is pretty average hence my overall rating would be six point five out of ten and the cells in India or 1800 rupees and I purchased this via Amazon I'll leave the link but I feel frankly the block point be at zero one these sell for about seventeen hundred rupees in terms of build quality these are actually much better than the me and also in terms of sound quality I feel these are slightly better anyways guys that was my review for this me super bass headphones if you guys are still not subscribed to my youtube channel hit that subscribe button and many of you might also ask me what about the means port bluetooth headset those are not headphones I definitely feel that the me Bluetooth the headsets that sell for about 1500 rupees are do sound better and this one anyways guys that's it for now for this review this is Ranjit and I hope to see you in my next video take care guys

that's pretty much it beautiful presentation and one thing I will say is when you open this up the smell is going to hit you right in your mouth I just got that new new headphone smell now for the headphones nice little carrying case does have a loop for your carabiner clip so open these up okay let's take a look at the carrying case real quick inside you got a little compartment right here for your cables little beats branding on it that's important and here's your headphones nice lightweight I went with the matte black to match my matte black iPhone why not little stickers beats logo on one side okay now this is your plus and minus volume up and down and your bluetooth pairing actual button right here does have a nice click got your leather ear cups these do adjust okay and adjust

charging up let's look this carabiner on so we don't lose it just like that clip this right in your gym bag all right so let me grab an iPhone real quick we'll pair these up and we do a little sound test here we go matter of fact let's see how let's see how it matches with the iPhone because this is important to the matte black looks beautiful together so they come in a bunch of different colors whatever color iPhone you got you'll be able to get the matching set of headphones this is part of the experience of buying beats not necessarily 100% for the sound you buying it for this you got your nice Apple watch your iPhone you want to keep everything uniform get the solos alright but don't get them yet let me do a little sound test will see if it's worth it alright so here we go let's open this up alright power these on here we go LEDs just activated ok now this just popped up solar to reconnect hit the button now it's connected just like that that might even be faster than NFC I don't know we have to do a little speed test 100 percent battery alright now for the most important part the sound test let's take it to some music let's see what we got on deck today what was I just listening to I just wrote let's throw some drink why not DJ Khaled and Drake here we go another one hashtag another one let's get maximum volume alright I hear the song right and nothing right now I'm putting these on here we go here we go whoo okay here we go I must have the super powers cuz I'm off a CC and and I'm off the Hennessy you know this deck ain't free oh the bass is knocking on these stay another day for attitude or not nah you [ __ ] Akbar your stomach on flat flat and you your [ __ ] what's that if y'all know the words man let's go you're the only one no can fit it all enough little wonder if you ask yourself is it just me is it just me this sex so good I shouldn't have to fall for free is it just me is it just me they say so good I shouldn't have to [ __ ] for free okay up to a top your life alright now let me stop being a high beast who these dudes sound good but for 300 bucks these headphones that sound better i diss headphones that sound better but you gotta remember when you're buying these beats headphones like the countdown I gotta got the right Lola when you buying these headphones it's not just about buying the headphones because honestly for 250 bucks you could get these right now let me show you the difference alright you could get these blue teal UFO pros all right now these are going to run you 250 and they sound better I'm just being honest with job they sound better they're a lot bigger they're a lot bigger hmm bill quality is a little bit less you know a little bit more flimsy up you know big UFO branding on it blue the old branding on it nobody really heard of these but they sound better they sound better these sound pretty good though alright now if I was putting the price tag on these I would be comfortable paying 200 bucks for these 300 a little bit extra but at the same time this is what you're paying for at you paying for that beats logo you're paying for that that Apple pairing and you're paying for the name and the brand now look I know which I hate is gonna say I know I already know here we go yo why bought beats beats ugh you could get the Sennheiser HQ old fours you could get the Audio Technica 108 m/s wide by the beach I know I know hashtag I know look it's not always about buying headphones or buying anything specifically for the sound or for that purpose sometimes you buy stuff for a fashion accessory so most of the time when you see somebody rockin beats they already know that there's better headphones on the market for cheaper they already know that but they don't care about that they want the beats because you seem LeBron James rocking these you see Nicki Minaj dj khaled you seen all the Olympic athletes rocking these you want to be part of the beats the whole beats ecosystem the act the Apple ecosystem you know you want to be fashionable and there's nothing wrong with that I get tired of arguing with people every day it's nothing wrong with that all right if you get up and you go to work you pay your bills you pay your taxes you take care of your family now you got some money left over and you want to buy some headphones you could buy these for 250 if you want they're gonna sound great or you could buy some of these and be a boss now when you hit them all and you're walking around with these on everybody's going to know you that dude that you that dude you got the Apple watch iPhone got the new beats solo threes on you doing it now you come through with these on you might know they sound better than beats but everybody's going to be like what's those yo what are those alright and I get I give you I give you a quick example I'll give you a perfect example the videos over but I'll give you a perfect example look you could go out and buy these right now all right we'll talk about sneakers because it's the same thing you could go out and buy these right now for 50 bucks 50 bucks a nice set of quality sneakers put them on wear them do what you got to do all right 50 bucks or you could go out and buy somebody's you can buy some of these for 250 what's the difference they both leather sneakers they both got a sole they both going to protect your feet they both got shoelaces they both probably made in Taiwan or somewhere what's the difference the difference is when you rock these gonna be saying water those and when you rock these you're gonna look like a boss that's the difference and like I said this there's nothing wrong with that there's a time and a place for everything when I'm going to work I come through with the Pumas on I come through with the blue teal headphones on not a problem but if I'm going to South Beach and I know I'm about to be in the airport I might need some P Y tees up in Jamba Juice might meet a nice little thought on the AirTrain I want to have on a fresh set of J's my Beats headphones fashion statement I so if you enter fashion statements and into you know quality stuff you know you want to be down with the in-crowd and all that nothing wrong with it nothing wrong with that overall on a scale of one to ten I would say I would say these are definite go the price is just a little bit Savage I wish the price would have been 250 you know maybe 200 250 which they will drop eventually they brand new so you're gonna pay that 300 a will drop eventually but they all go they do sound nice I was getting hight listening to the music the bass is heavy matter of fact y'all want to try it let's try arm let's try to wired connection and see how that sounds a lot of times these headphones they don't sound the same wired as they do Wireless now why would you want the wire simple if the battery dies and you don't have a charger then you're going to want that wired connection oh no headphone jack I let me pause the video real quick I got to grab my adapter hold on alright so I had to grab my little adapter I said we'll plug this in alright so it's on let's see how it sounds waiting for that bass drop you know what it is when you signed up now you got to run it up bass drop oh okay alright I go front these do sound good now they sound good actually I would say they sound better Wireless but they don't they don't take a big hit when you plug the wire in so you can rock these Wireless or wired and they're gonna sound good my only gripe price is a little savage but they do look hot I ain't gonna front these look hot yeah I'm definitely listen to this little gloss in there okay yeah I so this is this a nice little combination right here anyway so just a beat solo Wireless three special edition black hit me up in the comments let me know what y'all think about these and let me know if y'all want to do a full headphone comparison of all over the wires who are wireless ones I got now let you know which one is the best shout out to everybody that rock with me on Facebook Foursquare Twitter Google+ shout out to all the Google gangsters I see how holding down that Facebook page shout out to

Truly Wireless Earphones,2020-10-07 10:22:45.249144, hey everyone welcome back to another video damn does it feel good to be in front of camera once again listen I bought a new camera stand and now we get this top-down look that you guys have here and I'll continue tweaking it to make it look better over time but we'll work with this for now so today I'm showing you my test for the sennheiser momentum true wireless earphones that means there's absolutely no wires with these things I'll place my affiliate links down in that video description below for you to get the most updated prices in real time do you never know when these things might go ahead and sale also full disclosure here Sennheiser did send these over for review but my assessment was not altered in any way I'll be going over both pros and cons I'm Jimmy with Jimmy's review room and I'm here to help you make that purchase decision welcome everyone to another review [Music] all right folks going over the physical features first the earphones are mostly hard plastic with the Sennheiser logo in very much Sennheiser fashion shiny metal with texture and it does help to make this look and feel a bit more premium than many other more sport oriented truly wireless earphones out there now one thing that I will met though she's a bit thick and I don't mind thick but for earphones compared to many of the other competitors you can see it's just ever so slightly bigger I'll preface by saying everyone's ears are a little bit different and from my personal use in the office to walk around the Sennheiser do stay in the ears perfectly fine if I choose to run with these thankfully they don't fall out either but if you decide to run with these they don't provide that level of confidence like the j-bird run XT is the Jabra 65 T's and the others because I do notice the Sennheiser is just ever so slightly pulls a little bit forward for some reason it's a very minut sensation is not an issue though like I said I'd never fell out of my ear but it is something to take notice if you do own these let us know down in that comment section below for your experiences it does help others with any Jim's review room community now going over the physical controls their touch sensitive gently tapping or holding either earphone down trigger some sort of action for example holding down the right side of my earphone gradually raises volume while holding the left lowers it down here's the list of all the buttons on your screen feel free to pause the video if it's going a little too fast here now the only thing that I would warn them if you are to readjust your earphones like I'm doing right now to make it more comfortable or the hard time you may trigger Siri or Google assistance or accidentally pause your music now after a day I was used to the earphones and then I stopped touching them in general though the earphones do provide very good passive noise isolation not to mention very minimal to almost non-existent sound leaking but if for some reason you don't want to black out the world Sennheiser does offer transparency mode now with a double tap on the right earphone like so their microphones turns on and picks up the audio in your environment now you can use this for safety reasons or if you want to hear what going around you at work here now most other air phones do amplify your surroundings so you get superpowers that is like being able to hear better than what your ears aren't normally capable of with these Sennheiser's it's conservative compared to the competition it sounds the most natural it doesn't sound artificial which I don't mind at all actually really do appreciate but if you have music going on and transparency mode is activated you have to play music quite low to hear your surroundings at the same time keep that in mind now moving on the momentum truly wireless earphones are able to take phone calls from my personal testing it's one of the clearest in the office when you're around a quiet or maybe medium amounts of noise it doesn't block out everything but it does bring my voice to the forefront and in those quiet to moderate noisy areas it does suppress the background a pretty good bit here now in busier areas unfortunately just like most earphones here it does pick up background noises more noticeably but again for these sanitizers it is one of the better performers out there now as for Bluetooth technology the momentum true Wireless uses Bluetooth 5.0 so thank you sanitize it for free to proofing this thing basically the common issue though I've seen on previous brands where times the left earphone doesn't sync with the right earphone no my testing over the weeks that I've had this I personally didn't have that issue now the other thing the June preview community is quite large now but every time I review one of the things someone always asked me if they can leave one earphone in and the other one off with these Sennheiser's I can leave only the right one in and I can take off the left one put in my pocket or so now if I swap them out only leaving the left ear bud or earphone technically in it doesn't work if this is a must-have feature for you I am reviewing the j-bert XTS most likely next week and you can use either one of them in your head in your ears that is but getting back to you the Bluetooth testing with video Netflix and YouTube played fine with lips in audible dialogue performing in parallel I do recommend that you use these for movies when you get a chance they do sound pretty damn good here and last about signal strength Bluetooth technology bluetooth strength I'm able to walk 50 linear feet away from where I place my phone in the back of your studio I walked out into the hallway 50 linear feet isn't so bad most average consumers that'd be perfect we find but compared to competitors I'm getting usually a little bit better performance last before I talk about battery test these are ipx4 rated meaning you can take a splash of water from any direction now I dripped water on this thing here from my water bottle and it's still working fine for my test if you want protection from water sprays or literally literally this drop into a puddle of water and it's still fine then you need I pee 5 or higher most people are okay with IP 4 meaning if you get caught in the rain you should be protected with these 10 hyzers you just can't submerge them in water now moving on the case itself is very nice I personally love the fabric look here let me get this secret product I'm be reviewing pretty soon here I haven't seen where over the past month or so of testing bees they've been in my bag but pocket rubbing against other things that I carry and it still looks really really good also side notes they're magnetized and does a very good job of holding these earphones in the case as you guys can see here drop jump drop nothing so getting a closer look let's take a look at the back here sennheiser is using USB type-c thank you for future proofing once again the case itself provides an additional eight powers of power the ear phones themselves provides up to four hours of use so with my testing at 50% vine I'm getting on average 3 hours and 40 minutes from a full battery to dead so that sums up everything physical about them going over the physical features as well so let's get into the audio experience now I have one or two truly wireless earphones that I need to test out and then I'll be doing my top 5 video pretty short here but for the time being I can tell you that these Sennheiser's are fair in quality starting with bass these jaybird XTS which is the other one that I again am testing at the moment as slightly a bit more bass but for somewhat relative comparison you can tell that the Jaybirds are actually a little bit more bass boosted I don't mind that sound at all I really like it but these Sennheiser's are bassy but not artificial in my opinion there's no question enough thump punch Hecker enough bass that makes any genre pop Edie I'm hip-hop you name it it's clean and it gets my head nodding when I have vine bumping at boss five percent the vocals are distinct the key word here is very balanced across the board I could use a little more brightness or treble on the upper mid-range to make this sparkle a bit more from the factory settings but we can fix that with the app which I'll detail very soon now I think one of the highlights is hands down these have a wide soundstage audio separation depiction of every instrument beat vocal performance it's all there the mid-range has good resolution detail again being wide indistinct it's a very good experience overall as for the high frequencies it's never been ear piercing never over reaching or crackling again it could use just a little bit more than my personal opinion but here let me take out the app here and this has improved it for me let me show you alright folks let's take a look at the app as always being transparent with you guys the app was somewhat finicky at first I would be paired via bluetooth with my phone and the earphones functioned perfectly fine I was able to play music use the functions on the earphones themselves no big deal at all but the app itself for some reason could never see my earphones after probably about three days of messing around with it there was no updates during those three days but eventually the earphones started working and they've never faulted or never had issues since then so since it's been working you do get battery life which you can see here transparency mode is right below and right down there is the equalizer now although the equalizer at first looked a little too simple for my taste I'm honestly used to multi band adjustments and such but after using this the very subtle changes and the adjustments do work one side basically affects the other and keeps the audio signature relative so overall you really have ever user error or you can't really just mess us up in any way of form and on screen here's my setting I usually leave it like right around here and where it is right now compared to the stock setting it sounds a lot better just right around there so so last but not least let me open up these settings here and back out and go here so in the settings in the menu you get smart pause which means that whenever you take off your earphones music will pause automatically for you that's an awesome plus then we have auto accept phone calls and then voice assistant access which is pretty much self-explanatory so my entire experience here it's been a very positive one if I had to critique it would be this sighs I wish there was a slightly a little bit better battery life and honestly I wish more wireless earphones would include this but it's fine my ear phone action within the app if I drop one of these down on the ground or especially when I'm outdoors it would be nice if these can be pass ignore maybe on the phone it will review the GPS I don't know I'm not an engineer but for the price though I think that's a really big deal in my opinion and speaking of price if you guys can afford these highly recommend that you guys can give them a try most of my viewers I would probably say wait for them to go on sale and then definitely definitely check them out I think these you should not miss at all again I'm Jimmy with Jim's room please fire emoji up that comments section we're on the road to 1 million right now I'll catch you guys on the next one you guys take care bye [Music]

9|honor,2020-10-07 10:22:45.249166, yo what's up everybody it's your boy floss back again with another video and today we're going to take a look at the beats x wireless headphones now you can buy these from apple.com i'll throw the link up in the description the price 150 bucks now by the end of this video i'm going to answer the main question that everybody been asking me all week should you buy the beats x for 150 bucks or should you spend the extra 50 and get the powerbeats 3. now i'm going to go out on the limb and say get the powerbeats 3 but we'll put them to the test all right so let's check these out the beats x 150 bucks now these are available in a couple of different colors let's check out some of the features wireless bluetooth battery up to eight hours wireless play now these also feature fast fuel now in my opinion that's the best feature about these headphones what that means is you charge these up for five minutes and you get two hours of battery so if these are completely dead all you have to do is charge them up for five minutes and that's going to give you two hours worth of battery that is insane and trust me it's not a gimmick it works the same on the powerbeats 3. these are the kind of headphones that if you're using them for the gym you're never going to have to bring these in the house get yourself a little portable power bank and charge your headphones in your gym bag or when you get to the gym just plug in your headphones for five minutes while you're changing your clothes and you got two hours battery that's plenty of time for a full workout you got removable secure fit wing tips flex foam cable and control music and manage calls all right so 150 bucks let's check these out get your little arrow right here let's open these up okay now if you ever bought anything from beats you already know beautiful presentation talk lists and beats okay why not here's your headphones let's see what else you get try not to activate beast mode just came back from the flu shout out to everybody that wished me to get well i appreciate that great sound starts with proper fit so you got a bunch of different wing tips let's let's check them out now okay wait what's this hold up free apple music okay let me activate that before y'all get it oh you got your beat sticker all right you already know what to do with this anybody that has j birds or fresh eat buds or any kind of other headphones you take this beat sticker and you troll them with it i like that usual books and pluck them follow them to the side some more safety information it is what it is okay now this is a real nice presentation for 150 bucks you expect that this is going to be your carrying case okay let me do the smell test on this smells like velvet you got your little beats insignia on it it's definitely a matte finish on this so no fingerprints shout out to xerxes back in the building now this is one of those cases that there's no closure that's one thing i don't like no closure you just squeeze it just squeeze it and drop your headphones in and keep it moving now i personally like stuff like this better you see this way you could put all your extra wing tips put whatever you got your cables zip it up and you're good but you're spending a little bit less so you're getting a little bit less with the presentation case is a little bit more suspect let's see what else you get now here's your cable this is usb to lightning all right so this is the first set of beats headphones that have lightning instead of micro usb all right that's kind of cool different size ear tips we don't need to go through those and different size wing tips all right so we'll play with those now i tend to go without the wings but we'll see and that's pretty much it for inside the box look out xerx and here's your headphones let's see do they come with wings on them i no wings originally so you're gonna have to add them on i'll test these with or without the wings okay all right so here we go back up zerks back up let's take a look at these here's your uh trolling so hard here's your power button okay soft silicone filled to these now these have your magnetic ear cups okay you see they stick zerk zerks back up please please please look she just want me to touch you alright sorry i'm gonna touch you okay look i'm touching you now just chill now these have magnetic ear cups so if you're wearing these around your neck they'll still stay magnetized like this now these definitely got a little bit of length on these look how long these are all right these are super long just to give you a comparison let me grab the powerbeats three and we'll see don't eat those zerks and i'll show you the difference in the length now here's the power beats three zerks back up oh i can't all right now look at look at the difference all right here's the powerbeats three we can lay those right on the table and look at the the difference in the length okay so major length difference that could be a good thing or a bad thing for me i don't know we'll see a little beast brandon on this now these are flexible material i like that here's your lightning charging adapter right here your slot i know all right so we'll plug this in let's see if we can charge these up real quick this is one of my favorite new little power banks plug this let's turn this on okay let's see if we're getting any charge on these let's look for some where's the led at on these all right um don't see the led but i'm under this bright light let's see nothing on this side nothing on this one and so no no no charging led but these are definitely charging up so i will leave these in my gym bag just like this charging up or when i get to the gym just plug them in charge them for two minutes and you got two hours worth of battery life that's pretty dope all right um let me give zerg something to play with real quick hold up here's er check this out look go get that wow all right here we go now that i could get a better view okay super long oh i'm trying not to laugh too i'm still a little bit sick and the magnetized cable so that's one difference that the uh powerbeats three don't have they don't magnetize but now if you're buying these for the gym it's a no-brainer you're gonna want to get the powerbeats 3 because these are going to stay around your ears without having to mess with any kind of wing tips without having to mess with any different size ear tips you don't have to do nothing all you have to do is put these around your ear you could do a backflip you could go synchronize swimming so you could do whatever you want these are not coming out of your ears now i'll test these with or without the wings but trust me it's it they're not going to stay as good as the power beast powerbeats 3. now for the most important uh most important important test the sound right the most important ah jerks all right the most important test the sound so let me grab a phone real quick we'll pair these up and we'll see how they sound let me look for iphone all right so i was letting these charge up for a few minutes i just grabbed an iphone now let's test these out and on the side note these do have an led when they're charging up now these feature apple's w1 chip which is pretty much like nfc but a little bit better and all that means is these are going to be super easy to pair up now if you got an iphone or an ios device all you're going to have to do is power these on okay let's hit the power button and this should pop right up beats x connect now these are not just connecting to your phone they're connecting to icloud so that means right now if i go to my macbook if i go to my imac if i go to my ipad or my ipod these headphones will automatically be connected now that only works on apple products now if you got a non-apple device samsung galaxy lg v20 whatever phone or device you got these will still work you're just gonna have to pair them up using the old school bluetooth all right so let's check these out i'll do a little sound test now i'm not gonna do my usual sound test i'll test them out with a bunch of different songs not just one song we'll do a bunch of different songs but i'm just going to slap these in right now just to get an initial impression all right so so far i'm using them without the wings and i'm using them on the stock tips the stock ticks that came with them first song all right what song we got on deck we got 50 cent all right why not take it to 50 cent all right my bad y'all i was just about to test these out and i got a phone call and i don't want to blast the number on youtube so let's try these now i started the song from the beginning here we go i came in the world crying and fussing [ __ ] we have nothing ever ghetto i knows the same trying to make a little change preacher man come around talking i don't want to hear you keep walking i'ma put the powder in the pot whip it till i'm pulling up a lot imagine when i pull it off the lot new come without a top once a morning never gonna stop [ __ ] i'm on ain't never gonna here we go came in the game getting money getting money [ __ ] getting chained with the money click bang for the money change over money never see the [ __ ] on the bottom catch it come up gotta keep it on the low wow let's go down with the 36 o's look at here [ __ ] i'm a okay shorty won't with me she gonna hit my line we ain't gonna waste no time she sucking that you like she need me plus she make a bankroll easy with the tv we getting it on this the type of a [ __ ] be on too much on my mind right now i'm on my grind right now looking for me sucker then i need to be found right now look you're rolling mine right now look around right now better get in line right now i run a job right now hope you understand that [ __ ] on the man hold on the man you know i'm the man [ __ ] i'm the man all right all right let me chill let me chill uh y'all hear these all right let me pause these let's see if they're playing all right playing pause button does work woo all right now i got to keep it real with y'all whoo all right let me calm down i got to keep it real with y'all these do not sound like your classic beats headphones they sound loud crystal clear nice highs and mids but not that overpowering bass i was ready you know to get slammed with the bass nah nah ah a little bit disappointed a little bit disappointed now i gotta i gotta i gotta do a little comparison just to make sure let me let me find another iphone real quick all right here we go all right i gotta do a little comparison to make sure that it's just not me being a hypebeast but um nah i don't think um i don't think these have the beats signature bass sound now if you don't care about bass then that's cool but if you don't care about bass then why buy these you know you you're basically buying beats because you want a little bit more bass let's get to the same exact song i want to make sure that that i'm not just being a hype beast all right so we'll power the beats the pal let me let me get let me grab this real quick okay now same song i got the iphone connected to power beats three alright so let me slap these in real quick yeah now i could already hear i could already hear a little bit of difference let's make sure i got max vol all right okay here we go i'm just waiting for that beat to drop [ __ ] i'm on i ain't never gonna stop yeah i wasn't wasn't wasn't blown away by these though it wasn't blown away well let's see i'm the man buns came in the game getting money yeah these these sound way better these sound way better click bang for the money change over money all right now what i'll do is let's track these at the same time okay all right so now i'm gonna put one ear one in each ear yeah nah nah all right yeah all right i wasn't being a hypebeast wasn't being a hypebeast the powerbeats 3 definitely got more bass all right powerbeats 3 definitely got more bass but the beats x they are fifty dollars cheaper they sound nice and loud you get eight hours battery you get the best part though the fast fuel that five minute charge for two hours that alone might be worth it to bodies if you're not a extra base head then who cares and especially if you buy these to where at work or you're buying these to wear on the bus or the train and you don't really care about being overpowered with bass then these is cool and if you're gonna wear these running or jogging you know doing your outdoor workout you don't want them to be too loud anyway because you want to be aware of your surrounded sounds now let me pause the video real quick i'll try it with these wing tips on i'll try a different uh different song and we'll see let me try the wing tips though and see if i can get these to fall out of my ear talk amongst yourselves all right y'all so we back in now i just did a few sets of my bootleg workout to see if these would stay in my ears and they did i also tested them using a bunch of different songs but my initial impression is still the same on a scale of one to ten these is cool i like the sound crystal clear nice highs and mids and they get loud but they definitely don't have that signature beats bass that you come to expect from beats headphones and i'm definitely not feeling that now if i had to pick between the powerbeats 3 or the beats x i would definitely go with the powerbeats 3. spend that extra 50 bucks especially if you're getting them for the gym it's a no-brainer these are gonna stay in your ears way better than the beats x all right so get the powerbeats three and like i said if you buy these from amazon the black ones only you can get them for 150 bucks so it'll be the same price as buying the beats x from apple now you do got some benefits to these you got eight hour battery life you do got the quick charge five minutes for two hours that's a major goal and these look and feel nice i build quality the way they look the way they feel they do stay in your ears i i tried them with the wings now personally i'd probably rock them without the wings but if using them in the gym you may want to you may want to use the wings all right but for me for the gym i wouldn't even take a chance i'd rather just use the powerbeats 3. anyway like i said on the scale of 1-10 these is cool now if y'all know my scale you know what that means anyway hit me up in the comments let me know what y'all think about these shout outs everybody that rock with me on facebook foursquare twitter google plus shout out to all the google gangsters i see y'all holding down that facebook page shout out to everybody hit me up on foxer and a special shout out to everybody rocking

These are some of your questions, which I will answer in this video to help you choose. [intro] Peace be upon you all. This is your host, Faisal Alsaif with an exceptional video regarding your questions about wireless headphones. These headphones have become very popular, and for sure you need to know what suits you the best. Let me start with these questions. This question is from the FreeBuds 3 headphones, and if the noise cancellation works on iPhones. Noise cancellation with the Free Buds 3 works on all devices as they connect with Bluetooth. The feature is called Intelligent Noise Cancellation. The idea behind it is that it checks the best noise cancellation settings and turn it on. It is similar to adaptive noise cancellation, where the mics read your surroundings then cancel their sound. If there is a sound of air near you, it will be cancelled once noise cancellation is turned on and the audio quality will be excellent. Free Buds 3 will work with any device even with the iPhone. ""Let us know how comfortable these headphones are. Are they same comfortable as the previous AirPods generation or did the silicone affect it?"" This question is also about the Free Buds. These headphones don't come with Silicone ear tips. Not having a silicone tip makes it more comfortable when you wear it. You can move the headphone however you want and you won't be bothered by the silicone. The silicone is sometimes irritating as you have to push it inside the ear to get the best noise cancellation. AirPods Pro come with silicone tips, but it is for people who want noise cancellation. But with the Free Buds, when you wear them, you won't be isolated from your surroundings. But when the Noise cancellation is turned on, my voice will be higher and I won't hear my surroundings. The Free Buds don't come with silicone tips, but they also support noise cancellation. This is the best of the two worlds. It could be great for some of you. You won't need silicone tips and you'll still enjoy noise cancellation. Which is really great. But if you want noise cancellation with silicone tips, then the AirPods Pro is a great choice. ""Do the Samsung Watch and Samsung headphones work with the same phone?"" This question was asked in the Galaxy Buds video. Yes, the headphones and the Samsung watch work together with the same phone. With Bluetooth 4 and 5, you can connect two devices. With Bluetooth 5, the connection is open. But with Bluetooth 4, there were tweaks by manufacturers to enable two accessories at the same time. The answer is yes. ""Is there a sound lag in PUBG?"" This question is very important. This question was asked in the Free Buds 3 video. There is no sound lag. But you might notice it with other Bluetooth headphones. With no latency, you will be able to hear the sound as it happens. All players want this feature with their headphones. That's why most gamers use wired headphones. But if you don't want less latency, up to our experiment, there was no latency with the Free Buds. The best experience is to use the headphones with Huawei devices. Latency will be way reduced when connected to a Huawei device. That's what manufactures do with their accessories. ""Does this headphone support surround sound?"" This question was asked in the Sony headphones video. This Sony headphone has caused a stir up in the wireless headphone market with all the features it is packed with. Any wireless headphones with two sets is supposed to support surround sound. The AirPods first gen also supported surround sound, but it was not powerful. But most of Sony headphones support surround sound. You can also edit the sound with their app to get the best personal experience. You can also choose between, games, movies, music or audible books modes. ""Do AirPods Pro support wireless charging?"" And this question was asked in the AirPods Pro video. Yes, the Pro version supports wireless charging. You can charge it with a wireless charger or a phone that supports reverse wireless charging. ""Why no one thoroughly talks about the mic?"" We'll talk about it. Don't worry. ""I watched all the videos about the headphones, and no one talked about the mics. Most of the reviewers skip talking about it."" We make sure to review the mic performance in the videos, especially with wireless headphones. We can't give you a great example of testing the mics while we're in a studio. Some of you use their headphones while out and about with lots of noise, while others use them in quiet places. The experiments are different. We'll make sure to test the mics in the studio here to give you an example of the audio quality of the mic. ""Does my phone have to be Huawei to use the Free Buds 3?"" Supposedly, your phone has to be Huawei OR any other device, but the ecosystem is better. If you use the AirPods on Android devices, you will be shocked. While the AirPods with iPhone gives a very great performance. Manufacturers make accessories better with their devices. But they do their best so that their accessories work on other devices, but the pairing won't be the same. ""Tell us about how comfortable wearing the headphones is. Is it the same as the previous AirPods or does the silicone affect it?"" This question was from the review of the AirPods Pro. When I wear the AirPods Pro, I become isolated from my surroundings, which is something I like sometimes. But I don't like to isolated all the time as I also want to interact with my surroundings. At work, it is not suitable, while it is great for traveling. Ambient sound doesn't feel the same as natural sound, though. It is not only a problem with AirPods Pro, it is a problem with all other headphones. But it is up to the quality of the manufacturer. With the Bose and Sennheiser, the ambient sound is nearly natural. But the AirPods Pro, the ambient sound is a little bit digital. Despite the fact that the AirPods Pro are very great. But the ambient sound with them isn't natural. ""Are headphones' prices different from a store to another and from a country to another?"" Free Buds costs 599 SAR, but check for sales before you buy them. The last question is also about the Free Buds 3. ""When making a phone call, will the other side hear me clearly? And will they also hear the background?"" In my opinion, all headphones with noise cancellation cancel the noises in the background. It depends on the volume of the noises, though. Free Buds 3 does support noise cancellation. If you are wearing it correctly, the other side of the phone call will hear you very clearly. We've always received a good feedback when we tried them. The experiment was great with phone calls, and there was no noises in the background for the receiver. But if the weather is windy, it might be heard, but the intelligent noise cancelation is supposed to deal with it. We've answered most of your questions. Hopefully next episodes, we'll discuss other topics. We might make another video about wireless headphones. Hopefully, this video helps you decide what's best for you. Always check the prices and services of any product before you invest in it. If you want to buy one, don't raise the volume to the max. Don't hurt your ears. Don't use them for a long time. Protect your ears. You can't replace them, but you can replace headphones. This is the end of this video. Glory and praise be to Allah. I witness there is no God but Allah. I ask Allah for forgiveness and I repent to Him. See you later."

all these were available at a hundred and thirty dollars for a nice pair of Wireless cans definitely want to check him out and that price point is kind of like an in-between spot it's not too expensive but it's not cheap either so in this video we'll go over all the good stuff the pros and cons the case you're interested in picking these up and I'll tell you if it's worth it so first off the thing that really struck me was just the house simple and plain they are and I really like that there's no crazy graphics or colors on the headphones and it's so minimal for a wireless pair of headphones there is only three buttons on it on the backside of the right ear cup you have your volume up and down rocker it's embedded in these rubber buttons and in the middle is like you play pause take a call etc underneath that as micro USB port for charging it you also have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack on the bottom in case you want to use these wired if the battery dies then on the front side of the ear cup is also a little inline mic for you know like I said taking calls I obviously have it in black if you can get it in black like a grey a red and kind of like a navy color we do have some gloss plastic here along the yoke where the head cups sit and when talking comfort these really shine they're ever pretty low profile but they do expand to fit larger heads fits nicely up top they're just really really light weights with the ear cups you have definite ample padding as well as a little bit of padding on the top of the headband here definitely lightweight pair of headphones the ear cups swivel 90 degrees along the headband as well and one of my favorite things about these headphones is not only can they lay flat on a surface or something like around your neck but they also fold into the headband making these very very portable through bringing them with you on the go now how's it moving - the sound quality one thing I want to mention is we do have 40 millimeter drivers here on the Hesh 3 and like I said just tons of padding on the ear cups they do a really good job of creating like a suction and isolating and eliminating any background noise around you you should not have active noise canceling as some headphones do but they like I said they do a good job just eliminating that and creating a good but now let's talk about the sound quality that's gonna be one of the most important things when you're evaluating which headphones to buy so talking about bass these really shine in the mid loads of that area where you get a nice tight punch all around your music I listen to a bunch of things from like electronic you know some old-school hip-hop stuff like that on Spotify definitely tested a variety of songs here and really found the bass shines now as for the mids and trebles I found these kind of straight away from that flat response that and though most audio files would prefer but again these aren't made for audio files themselves I felt like the mids were kind of toned back and overall I think the whole sound signature here was just tight and punchy throughout so with the vocals and stuff they weren't overly like crystallized no it might sound like that nice and tinny they just did a good job of staying warm I feel and overall I think favoring the bass so if you're a bass head you're probably gonna like these so like I said audio files meant up for the sound signature that these have I for one enjoy it I thought they were kind of fun if you want to call it that to the average person who just wants a good sounding pair of headphones at that price they are not gonna mind the sound quality at all especially if you like bass now the next important thing is gonna be battery life and I believe they had these rated at 22 hours I find out throughout my week testing that pretty much held up I'll other recharge them once by listening to it constantly throughout the week know it's like stuff from the the office around the office stuff like that about what really makes me happy is they had this like battery quick charge technology where if you just charge these up for five minutes you get 90 minutes of battery life so say you're new you're walking around campus or something like that you're going on a car ride these are dead well charge them for five minutes you'll have an hour and a half of battery which is really good like I mentioned earlier they include the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack in case you want to use these wires so good yeah kind of recapping here I love the design here very simple minimal always a plus for me very lightweight and comfortable which obviously is gonna be a plus to anybody who wants to wear these out getting like a headache or anything and sound quality I thought was very good considering the price point here and they did cater to my my Christmas Hort of a signature taste that I like when listen to music for cons I do wish these included a carrying case since they are so portable I mean it'd be cool just have like a little sleeve or a pouch something like that secure these around with so they don't get damaged that would have been nice and second is well the Bluetooth technology I believe is rated for like 33 feet or something like that I found that it does have a hard time going that distance when there are walls in the way so while it works for me no problems around my office when I'm starting to go to different rooms or across the apartment it started to cut out a little bit but I mean for $130 here it is hard to complain they're Wireless they look good they sound good I'm a fan of them minor cons like I mentioned in the end for that price point it's really not too bad you look at the competition out there for a wireless pair of headphones again not a headsets I'm a fan of that I think it's pretty solid price point if you want to check it out I will put it listed for you in the description down below if you like to review give it a thumbs up so your support feel free to follow me on Twitter at random Frank P alas if you haven't already hit that subscribe button I'm random Frank P hope you enjoyed have a good day

[Music] relax your geeky headphones came in the mail [Music] look at that I just think these are so neat I don't know so anyways geeky send me a pair of bluetooth headphones so that I can pick them up one-on-one against traditional headphones to see which is better in a series of different tests a series of different Tufts pickles and the first category we're gonna be looking at is obtrusiveness which of these is more obtrusiveness [Music] [Applause] so in terms of obtrusiveness the traditional headphones blues now let's test the tangle factor between the two let's just take these out of my pocket shall we how does this happen I couldn't tangle them up this bad if I tried now the geek ease because they are bluetooth you can do this to them you can put them in your pocket and lo and behold they will never tangle alright so between the two which work better with an iPhone so let's test out the traditional headphones first and we'll see which works better how do you plug it in do I need a nap oh that's right iPhones don't have headphone jacks if an iPhone user does want to use traditional headphones they have to buy this what is that what the hell is that yeah that's what everyone wants for their iPhone a dangly ridiculous little I penis literal people sat around a conference table and we're like how can we make it so you can use headphones on an iPhone oh oh I know we'll make some genitalia that you can strap on to it now that I actually see it attached to the iPhone I think it actually looks better in the garbage but you know what that doesn't even matter anymore anyways cuz these connect to your iPhone through bluetooth you better connect don't make me bust out the eye strap on okay here we go let's click on the geeky BAM connected so there we go I guess there's no more need for eye genitalia [Music] now in terms of which one gets better range I think this one's pretty obvious [Music] though the key keys do have a ten meter range easy win here and another advantage these have over other headphones it has a built-in mic so you can make phone calls hello yes did my cream come in yet let's see headphones do that hello hello okay well at least these headphones are good for other things now let's talk about the lifespan between the two headphones my previous pair of headphones well a couple weeks ago the left earbud became a left ear dud the left ear started too short and now it's so then I'll go buy another pair of headphones and then like three months later the same thing happens all over again so yeah maybe these kinds of headphones just suck maybe I suck at picking them either way they're a pain in my left ovary it's not like I dropped with them right think it's not like I'm like oh I gotta listen to music now relax it's okay these were broken to begin with now these are my first pair of bluetooth headphones so I can attest to the lifespan of them but I can only assume that they're gonna last longer than three months because they won't short out like these though I do have to give bonus points to the traditional headphones cuz let's leave bluetooth headphones do this I'm actually really impressed by how mature I'm getting as I get older [Music] let's see if this works alright well I can't believe that actually kind of worked I don't know how accurate this test really is but yeah definitely the D Keys have better low-end okay so even though it is a super close race I'm giving this one to the Bluetooth ease doesn't look like I have a big old booger so in terms of ease of use traditional headphones very complicated very complicated you put either ends of these into your ear gaping and you stick this end into your phone or iPod okay where's my eye pecker and bam super complicated stuff now the Bluetooth headphones may be slightly more complicated at first and by slightly complicated I mean you have to press a button to pair your device with your device oh my god that's like so complicated and the other main difference between the two god that's so ridiculous and the other main difference between the two is the Bluetooth headphones you have to charge whereas the regular headphones you only have to replace every five minutes because they short so charging them however is a bit of a breeze because remember that cool little carrying case this is also the charger and just to come in there like this and the glowy glowing this means that they're charging convenient and when the charger runs out of juice you just plug it in and it recharges itself super complicated stuff [Music] now the wireless are also water-resistant apparently they're water-resistant for like sweat and like small droplets of water it doesn't say anywhere that they're resistant to showers I hope I didn't break my giggy's cuz I don't want to have to go back to these these are only good for one thing now but I will say this it's pretty convenient when you're listening to music and you have to go to the bathroom and you can just like go you could just walk off and do your business your butt business cuz with these guys your phone is gonna have to tag along with you I gotta make a palpate all right well there you have it a one on one with the traditional versus new I don't think I'm gonna be needing a pair of these anymore cuz these are just so if you want your own set of geeky headphones follow my link in the description to get them and Miley gets you 20% gotta do it get them that was very convincing and as always a huge thanks to you guys for watching I could never do what I do without you guys so I super appreciate it we'll get rid of this I'll see you in the next video please subscribe if you haven't already and just know I love you that's it I'm done peace love you okay [Music]

wireless headphone|budget headphones|budget bluetooth headphones|budget bluetooth headset|wireless headphone|geekyranjit,2020-10-07 10:22:45.249407, [Music] hi there this is raunchy Dan and this video we'll be doing the review for the Motorola pulse escape headphones and quite a few of you who are asking me to review some budget oriented bluetooth headphones so I just saw this one and though the price quoted here on the box is six thousand four hundred ninety nine this one was available on Amazon India for two thousand one hundred and fifty rupees so I thought why not test it out so this is the headphone itself and it's a bluetooth headset and as you can see in the box it claims that it has about ten hours of playback time I didn't test it completely I would say yes it lasts for a long time easily about seven to eight hours it also says it has passive noise cancellation and it's light and foldable and come back to that later and apart from that here it says that it has that 40mm drivers and I mean it has a Bluetooth range of about 60 feet it says and it's eally and Google compatible and the good thing is that it also has a microphone so you can actually take calls with this one so how is this this one so this is the headphone as you can see it's completely made up of a plastic and yes as foldable you can fold it like this but you notice that sound plastic sound that is coming so that's the problem with this one I'm scared to actually fold it because it makes that noise and don't terms of sound quality the Sun quality is surprisingly good but the build quality as it guys can guess is simply not that great so I would personally not just fold it like this and carry it in a backpack or something because I'm afraid this can break this is pretty rigid and this also is not that in terms of physical overview the good thing is that it comes with these two cables also so it's not mandatory to actually use it over the Bluetooth connection you can also attach it directly this in here and other end to your smartphone and this is for charging again as a microUSB cable so you can plug this to your power bank except try to charge and we also have a lid over your light and a microphone to take the calls as you can see it is blinking because it's paid with my smart phone currently and this one actually hoses all the controls this is for actually powering it on or off you hold it for some times and you have Plus this is the minus and this is plus for the creasing the volume you can pause the music also if you just press it like this and also accept calls why this so all the operations are from this power game this feels very very plasticky in nature those very cheap plastic kafeel it gives Motorola should have put a lot more attention in the quality now coming to this cushion pads they're fairly good I would say considering the price point and they good provide good cushion to your years but the fit is slightly on the tighter side so yeah you've got to get used to this one so as you can see in terms of sound now let's talk about the sound here surprisingly I was actually impressed with this one don't get me wrong it's not mind-boggling or whatever but considering the price point I'm making a price point of about two thousand one hundred fifty to two thousand two hundred and for that price I would say the sound quality over Bluetooth I used to mostly over bluetooth currently it is still connected to my body say smartphone and it blinks and blue color when it's connected when you're charging this blinks in red this actually glows red when you're charging so yeah the connection is great the Bluetooth connection is good and the sound output was actually really good in fact I would rate it about eight point five in terms of some quality so the sound quality is good but as I mentioned in terms of comfort and the feel this is very very plastic you feel it gives you that cheap plastic feel that's the problem with this one and again in terms of durability I don't think so this is going to be very durable if you are a person who's going to carry around because this doesn't give me the confidence this as you can see it's making that clicking noise and stuff so again you've got to be careful if you are sort of roughy I will simply not recommend this phone but if you're a very careful user and you would probably use this one in your house and you don't have a very high budget for a Bluetooth headset you can't go with this one because the sound quality is actually good but again be prepared for that extra plasticky build quality so certainly I would say I will not recommend this for the MRP price that they're quoting here that is 6490 but for the price of about 2100 to 2200 yes you can go with this one if you are sort of a careful user if you are a rough user I will simply not recommend you this headset because of the build quality so guys if you are using this pulse escape do share your opinion in the comment

▬ ABOUT THIS VIDEO ▬
Powerbeats3 vs. BeatsX. In this video we talk Beats Powebeats 3 vs. Beats X and which bluetooth headphones are right for you. Obviously, people will have these on their list of the best bluetooth headphones 2019 and some may even put them on the list of best workout headphones 2019. We are not entirely convinced as of yet because we're in the early days of the year, but we are pretty big fans. Now, for wireless headphones, we like both the BeatsX and Power beats 3, but really the Powerbeats are the workout headphones whereas the BeatsX are mostly general headphones made to wear all day. The BeatX are one of the best beats wireless earphones for keeping on you throughout the day because they feature magnets in each earbud so you can always find them. Furthermore, the BeatsX wireless earbuds have pretty good sound quality for the size. For both, we think the bass is good, mids are decent, and highs are good, but sometimes it does sound a little shallow. Anyways, hope you enjoy this BeatsX vs. Powerbeat3 review.

from R is no calm today we are talking about the power these three versus the beats X we received a lot of messages and comments from you guys asking for this video and we were playing basketball earlier today and we were like hey maybe we should do that video that was right in the middle of Matt Ross the boss putting D pain in an absolute body bag here's the proof Oh Oh God okay so back to me before we get into the video you should subscribe if you haven't already you're going to love this channel if you love beats products you're going to love rizz nose also we did individual reviews of them and the link to those videos are down below in the description okay let's get to it all right so before we talk power beats three versus beat sex you should definitely check out Liz no calm that's our website we find the best deals every single day it's not every single hour and we post about them on our website so stuff you actually care about we oftentimes find deals on beats headphones and jaybird headphones and Apple products and Garmin products and stuff that I think you guys really really like so I think if you aren't checking out resna calm before you buy something in those categories you're probably spending too much money so check the link out right here on the screen and go to r is no com okay so why would you get the power beats three and the main reason is they are workout headphones I mean it really comes down to application when you're talking about these two headphones I mean they're both wireless headphones they're both Beats products and they're both pretty awesome but the power beats three are really good workout headphones they have a very secure fit they wrap around your ear you can shake your head you can do CrossFit you can play basketball you can have a really strong strength training workout and they're not going to fall out of your ears and they're not going to fall off your head so a lot of people like them for that fact also they do a pretty good job of completely sealing off your ear canal so really good sound isolation both on the Thar beats 3 and on the beats X so both of them do a good job now the power beats 3 because there's a little bit more to them it's going to be kind of like an ear by ear type thing so for me they don't you know isolate the sound so great but for a lot of people out there does a really good job of keeping out any of that external sound and their water in sweat resistance so if you want something with that rating you probably go power b3 they also have a cable management clip so that you know cinches them closer to your head so you can go running with them and it kind of keeps the rest of the cable out of your face with the beat X if you do go working out with them even though it's got a secure fit they even come with ear fins if you shake your head around if you do anything a little bit more dynamic you're going to see that cable moving around so definitely power beats 3 anything workout you're going to want them for and they have better battery life so the power beats 3 come in at 12 hours on a single charge and the beats X are right around 8 hours so better battery life on the power beats 3 it really does come down to if you're going to use them a lot you're going to use them for working out and in terms of price point the power beats 3 are right around 200 bucks we've seen some awesome deals on that I think I'll be seeing 50 bucks off not too recently and then the beats acts are 150 dollars so there is a little bit of a price chasm there now the reason that you would get the beats X is you want all day headphones something that you're going to keep around your neck and you're going to pop them in to take a phone call or to listen to music I think there's like my buddy that's a limo driver we talked about them on our snapchat the other day or somebody that's just in the office that wants to just use headphones here and there so they are a lot more about convenience that's what the beats acts are all about they even have magnets in the tips of the earbuds so they can magnet together and you could always find the earbuds like I said they have pretty good sound isolation they got the ear fins to keep them in your ears they even have like the inline remote mic both of them have that but what's really cool with the beats X is if you put them in your ear since they're always hanging around your neck the microphone hangs closer to your mouth so if you take a phone call the person on the other side of that phone call hears you a little bit better so that's kind of cool but still you know we are splitting hairs here they're both beats products are both pretty awesome it really comes down to application workout headphones versus general headphones both of them have great compatibility with iOS devices they will work with Android devices but really you're going to get them if you're an iOS user if you are using iCloud if you sync them with one device you can see them all cross all of your other devices so we really like that also like I said they have the inline remote mic so you've got volume up volume down they've got track management and Siri they work with that that's great the beats X you're going to be using a lightning cable to charge them so one cable the one that's on your iPhone and then the power beats three use micro USB both even has the quick charge feature so if you charge them for just like five minutes you're going to get an hour to two hours worth of playback which is pretty awesome I mean that's one of my favorite features about some of these newer beats procs you plug them in on your way to the gym for example and you can at least get that work at so that's awesome and because they have the w1 ship from Apple the Bluetooth range and the stability is pretty good people are not going to get in the way walls and doors I mean the stability and range is pretty good on both of these headphones and also the audio quality we haven't discussed that yet so they're pretty similar if I had to give the edge to one over the other I might give it to the beats X although they're very close they both have good bass good mids the one thing if sometimes they sound a little bit raspy and shallow but by-and-large pretty good audio quality on both of these headphones I like them obviously if you're an audiophile you're going to say I'm crazy if you're an audiophile don't get them for most people though the audio quality is just fine so really it comes down to the application like I've said before workout headphones versus a general headphones and that's it let me know ease onto the video click the thumbs up button down below go crazy on it go beats on it if you like this video and also subscribe check out rizz no calm and I'll see you guys in the next one [Music] you [Music] Oh you

The video includes a comparison of OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z vs Realme Buds Wireless vs Oppo Enco M31 vs Mi Neckband Earphones vs Thomson Earphones. 
In the comparison we found that Realme buds Wireless performed better than the very popular Boat Rockerz 255 and hence took the 3th position. The list has not only focused on sound but also on the other aspects like the build quality comfort and fit of the earphones. These earphones were tested not only with music, but also with games like Pubg. Unfortunately, all earphones exhibited some lag and hence neither were suited for the title of the Best bluetooth earphones for gaming.
Nevertheless, this list has got you covered even if you're looking for the best bass earphones under Rs 2000. We have extra bass earphones like the Realme buds Wireless which have a fantastic bass performance. 
The Oppo Enco M31 on the other and offers a balanced sound quality and can easily defeat even the best wireless earphones under Rs 5000.

Frank P today we're gonna be reviewing the razor thresher ultimate headset now a quick note before you begin the thresher ultimate comes in an xbox version and one for the ps4 both do work on PC and I obviously have the Xbox one version that I'll be reviewing for you guys you could pretty much take everything I'm saying here and apply it for that ps4 variant because it's the same thing now a quick look inside the box to see what's inside and we as always have some nice packaging from Razer always gotta give them props for the unboxing experience inside you'll find the headset the audio hub which is going to be like the base for all your connectivity and your wireless pairing we have an optical cable if you choose to use that plus two micro USB cables one for charging and one for connecting it underneath that also inside the box they include a stand for the thresher which is always pretty cool I could definitely appreciate something like this being included with the headset because not only does it give it a nice place for it to stay when you're not using it it keeps everything organized so it's not just laying down somewhere possibly getting damaged the first thing we're gonna do is go over the layout and the buttons on the thresher ultimate and on the bottom of the ear cups is where pretty much everything is on the left side there's a little volume wheel for your microphone and on the right side is the volume wheel just for the headsets overall volume both of the wheels can be pushed into either mute the headset or mute the microphone then the left ear cup is also the microUSB port for charging it and the power button which to turn on and off or to pair to the hub you have to hold in for 3 seconds next is the retractable boom mic here on the bottom on the left ear cup when you put it on it's nicely stowed away if you want to use it and pull it out it can get bent right in front of your mouth for you which is always really great and I like what headsets do this because it's not just they're you know dangling when it's not in use if you just put it back into the ear cup so it won't get like bent or anything like that don't worry I'll have a mic test for you in just a few minutes and now for the overall design of the thresher ultimate I really like it it doesn't look too aggressive but at the same time it lets you know it's a razer headset we do have 50 millimeter drivers here and extremely soft leather earpads that it's like pillows on your ear very very comfy on the side of the drivers it's kind of like an open grilled at the same time it's still considered closed back and the way that the headband is constructed is really great because it allows a headset to sit on your head while applying zero pressure you can see it can push up the band itself he had these two aluminum bands on top just for really a structure support but the band with the mesh and the the padding inside is really really nicely it just sits on your head zero pressure and adjusts by itself big fan of the comfort and another feature that I always appreciate is the ear cuffs themselves also to stay flat 45 degrees you can rotate them down so you like putting around your neck or something if you want to lay them flat on your desk you can then we're gonna talk about the audio bass real quick it's nice and compact which is always good you have your Razer logo on top on the front of the bass is the power button you'll notice a little green strip light up on the bottom to let you know when it's powered on and on the back is gonna be all your connections you have your optical in and optical out cables if you choose to use that even though it's included it with Xbox and a PC switcher your micro USB port for connecting it to your PC or your Xbox one and the USB port there for charging it if you need to if you want to use it on your Xbox the only difference you have to make is putting that switcher on the back side to the Xbox side or switch it to the right size and want to use it for your PC really that easy what's also really cool is with the included headphone stand and this audio base they kind of fit together the headphone stand just goes right on top of it it'll snap into place and now you can have the base your headphone stand and your headphones sitting all as one unit when you're not using it I can definitely appreciate that design choice here from Razer keeping down on clutter is always good so next is the most important part about this headset and that is the audio quality and overall for most I refuse I don't give ratings or anything but I feel like before headsets or headphones that's where it's most appropriate but I could say the Thresher ultimate here for being a wireless headset I'm gonna give the audio quality itself a 9 out of 10 when it's just on the regular audio setting I found that a lot of times pretty much on Xbox I used it for games like you know FIFA and Madden so it wasn't really putting it to its fullest test you know but on PC I used it a lot for games like Battlefield or battleground where no positional audio is everything that's very important and I found just overall everything sound very crystal clear but you will kind of expect that for that $250 price point but I do want to mention one thing which I think is pretty severe on top of the audio base you have a little button which can enable there like Dolby surround sound and this is kind of a pretty big selling point you know a wireless headset with Dolby Surround but I'm telling you guys right now do not use that because it completely kills the audio experience what it pretty much does is just boosts the mids a little bit but everything else kind of gets like drowned out when I was playing battlegrounds the plane was flying over me with it disabled that I could directly hear where it was coming from what direction and once I had it V dole we've turned on everything to sound like it was in both ear cups so you do lose that directional stereo audio when it is turned on like I said I cannot recommend that that advice pretty much bought you a chicken dinner and now for the next part is gonna be the mic test which is probably the second most important thing here it is automatically you know enabled once you have your PC or your xbox power it on you can use it for you know chatting with your friends online on your xbox party so I'll do a mic test for you guys on both platforms you could hear how it sounds alright so real quick this is the mic test for you guys hooked up to the PC so this is how it would sound if you were streaming on Twitch or something or you're talking to your friends unedited audio and just real quick for the next portion I'll just talk about the battery life so you can hear how this sounds it does say 16 hours on the box or you know that's what it's rated at I found it got a little bit closer to 14 hours battery life probably because I'm switching back and forth between my xbox one a my PC so whether they give you guys that little tidbit of information so you can hear how the mic sounds so now to switch it up a bit to give you guys a mic test like if you were playing xbox one in games stay in party chat this is how it would sound again with the game in the background to kind of differentiate here and see how the sounds versus the PC if there is a difference but again it's how it's gonna sound if you are in an Xbox one party with a game going in the background you can get an idea of how it's gonna sound now honestly I would a lot better everything just sounds hollowed out and kind of tinny and far away and for $250 I wanted some better mic quality out of this especially with things out there like the antlion mod mic and the mass drop mini mic sounds ten times better for like fifty dollars and under since this is an all-in-one you know it's Wireless it's built into the headset I guess they're taking the kind of a cut back there with the mic quality it's gonna be okay if you're just you know playing with your friends online you wouldn't be doing like Pro voiceovers for YouTube or anything but that's just my two cents now for the overall wrap up here of the razor thresher Ultimates like I said I don't really do ratings and stuff but I feel like all around it's a solid eight it's very very comfortable it is definitely one of the most comfortable headsets that I've tried for this size I mean it's not like discreet or anything it's overall kind of big but it's nice and light for the most parks everything that's going on here and with the headband and the ear cups it is just very very comfortable the sound quality stock without the Dolby Surround enabled is fantastic absolutely great audio pretty much zero distortion or buzzing in the background since it is Wireless usually have some interference but there was nothing really audible with this the biggest downfall is gonna be having that Dolby Dolby Surround enabled and the mic overall and I guess that price points gonna be a little bit of a con for most people because that's very expensive but if you need a wireless headset for both the Xbox one and your ps4 or your PC like how you can buy either variant whatever console you have this is a pretty good option you do get the included headphone stand and that nice audio base but you connect together for one unit which is really great and all together I think an 8 is a pretty solid pretty solid number or good rating for these so if you guys want to check it out or find out more about these if you want to pick them up I will put a link to the Razer thrush your ultimate headset in the description down below like I said it for both Xbox one and ps4 if you guys liked this review definitely give it a big thumbs up and show your support feel free to follow me on twitter at random for NP i'm gonna take these off now and last if you haven't already hit that subscribe button well

hedphones,2020-10-07 10:22:45.249586, welcome to the best where we find the best product in its category on this episode we're looking for the best noise canceling wireless headphones I'm Aya's act heart with our expert David Carr noise we're going to judge these headphones on five different criteria let's start by introducing the competitors the Jabra elite 85h both noise cancelling headphones 700 bang &amp; olufsen vo play h9 sony WH 1000 X mark 3 and sennheiser momentum 3 Wireless now David why are these the ones we're choosing from because they would be the ones that I would be choosing from these are all premium models they all cost $300 or more it's obviously pretty expensive there are several others that cost a little bit less but these really are the best of the best right now anyway all right first matter is noise canceling let's explain how noise canceling headphones work now these headphones have microphones on them to hear sounds around them that sound is analysed and then the headphones produced their own noise to cancel out the external noise okay David how did our competitors fare these are all really good at noise canceling some are slightly better we gave this round to the Bose partially because not only does it do the noise cancelling of sound around you while you're listening to your music but when you're making calls the noise reduction on this is really great you can make calls on these in noisy environments not all of these can do that when it comes to different environments like a droning airplane or let's say the intermittent noise of a city did any one of these fare better in a different environment the Bose might be slightly more tuned to airplane noise but right now these are all some of them have they adjust on the fly to the environment you're in the Sony does that I personally don't like it that much because sometimes you hear a little thing that goes off in the headphones when it makes a switch to performer no chance really so I tend to go with a fixed level of noise cancelling whenever I can in terms of the pecking order of these again there are slight differences I would say the Sony and the Bose are at the top and then you have the other ones just a touch down with some small variations in terms of it always cancel the winner of this round is the Bose because of its noise reduction for making calls that's top notch but you might be wondering why are we listening to this guy anyway what does this guy know about headphones here's why David Carr knowing executive editor he's been with CNET for almost 20 years he reviews headphones earbuds portable audio products he readers mobile accessories and more David was a key figure in founding CNET's consumer electronics review program in 2000 they even call him Wireless Dave outside of Tech David has written three mystery novels you obviously know what you're talking about let's keep digging into your brain round two features headphones do a lot more than just making sound let's start with something like controls but they each have controls on them three of these have touch controls the sony the bose as well as the Bang &amp; Olufsen some people like that some people don't the Sennheiser and the Jabra have physical buttons people like those physical buttons better on the Sony for instance there was one small complaint that people had about it in really cold temperatures they were complaining that the controls actually didn't work now the new bose we asked them about that they claimed that those touch controls will work in cold temperatures I think everyone's now aware of that but the electronics do freeze up in really cold temperatures do we have any unique features about any of these things because I mean they can't just be all the same right a lot of them have adjustable levels of noise canceling the Sennheiser has a new feature it has a tile a little piece of tile technology so that you can track it on your phone so if it's house a little Bluetooth tracker so if you lose the device anywhere other tile devices essentially create a network so you can find this if you leave it on the subway if you leave it on a train if you leave it in your house somewhere and so obviously these are expensive headphones could get stolen all these have a transparency mode that allows ambient sound in so there's noise canceling but then there's that you want the reverse sometimes you want to be able to hear the outside world the Bose has very natural transference mode at almost when you put that on it almost feels like you're it's as if you took them off yeah it's as if you took them off Wow it's sony has some very interesting features in terms of it has a quick attention feature where you put your hand over the ear cup say you're on a plane talking to a flight attendant so you can put it on to know you're watching the movie you you want to talk for a second it mutes your sound and then you can talk to him or her and then you let it go and you're back to listening to your movie these devices do they all use microUSB are they using wireless charging how do you charge these guys these all use USB see which nice which they all should and that also there's also a quick charge feature in these so you can charge them for 15 minutes and in a lot of cases get a couple hours of battery life all of these get over 15 hours of battery life some of them do more the sony has up the most hours that their it's rated at 30 hours had moderate volume levels I mean USBC is really useful because if your phone really uses it you don't need to have a special charger for these guys that's great when it comes the battery life that's gonna vary depending on how you use these things if your listen to music movie loudly we're listening to certain kinds of music things will change by person and by music and as David mentioned all of these guys survive over 15 hours so if you're worrying about battery life over time that might change but 15 hours when they're brand new at least and then you've quick charges on top of it yeah and one feature actually some people want is if the battery dies will it still play music and somebody's certainly do that including the new new Bose the other thing worth mentioning is these all could be wired headphones and most of them work as a wired headphone if the battery dies so you don't necessarily need power to listen to them one of the other kind of convenience features with these is that some of them turn on automatically for instance when you these fold up the Sennheiser you can hear it saying uh noise what does it say it said power off power off okay okay and then when you go like that power on and the the job is also do that when they they fold flat and then when you put them on they automatically go on alright so which one takes the cake when it comes to features we are giving it to the Bose lion-o's oh it's fine knows it does again it it has adjustable levels of noise cancelling it also is the only one that has always on Alexa if you want it that means that you can program it you can choose between Google assistant and Alexa and you can either use a button if you want or with Alexa anyway not Google assistant you can say the way qward Alexa and and talk to it in it will respond so it right now is the only headphone of these on top of that the Bose does have a little extra feature called Bose ar ar is an augmented reality is the audio of materiality it's a new platform does that even mean like would it can't show you images it's gonna automatically so the idea is like if you would be out there in a foreign city for instance there would be an app that would tell you what you're looking at there sensors that you can actually look at a building and it would tell you exactly what you'd be looking at but like a guided tour is through the EM there's other applications with that but that's what Bose is that's one of the easy things to understand and again that that the ability the noise reduction capabilities while you're making calls and it being the best for making calls we think the job is probably a close second the Sony isn't quite as good as from making calls the Sennheiser's quite good the banging off since decent but really it's the the bose and john per second the Jabra Jabra makes obviously is known for its headset so it this is a very good headphone also for making calls is there's a feature called side tone that allows you to hear your voice in the headphones as you're talking so you're not the person yelling when you have the headphones on is that what you're telling me wow I need lots of people to get those then so the the new Bose has that job or has that the Sennheiser has it as well so that that's a nice feature to have there's a lot of great features everywhere but this round goes to Bose because it's packed with lots of useful features it stays in the lead let's move on to round 3 which is Comfort what's good are headphones if they hurts to wear we asked a few people around the office to find out they're for impressions of these headphones alright shopper what you got well it feels comfortable it feels pretty good nobody this super comfortable actually I've used Sony a different model of Sony that are shaped similar to this yeah this is pretty comfortable also very comfy it feels good lightweight I don't like the fit of this one I usually don't like round ear cuffs because they don't fit my ears right definitely comfortable in the ears those headphones they are comfortable oh this is nice this is also less bulky this is I guess Anheuser yeah alright too heavy okay you just feel a little heavier I did choose one huh girls I'm down with the silver I think Sony's gonna be my pick if I was to actually purchase headphones today these would be it the Sony because it's lighter and the cushion is the softest I think this one is the most comfortable and also one of them must be ready for once lots of different opinions with Sony getting the most votes but you know those people had a very limited time when it came to these headphones David how long do you wear them to find out how comfortable they are I mean I certainly wear them for hours at a time will be a wear one for a full day mi try Mon as you mentioned this and I even go on for a week or two swapping between them I personally don't have a problem with the comfort of any of these they're all very comfortable headphones but there are slight differences that might work better for one person another these Sennheiser's I feel like I'm wearing those things you see from construction workers but they are built really well and they have that iconic momentum designed a lot of people like these are brand new to the market and we pick up the Sony's if I have they have they feel like these these feel light until recently what happened was you had a fight between the Sony's and the old bows which were the QuietComfort 35 twos which have been on the market for a while a lot of people still like that model we didn't include in this roundup but it certainly is one of the best noise cancelling headphones in terms of comfort people think that in some ways is a little bit more comfortable than the new new ones so that's why we're leaning towards the Sonia is the most comfortable it is the lightest the-- the bose actually got slightly heavier than the QuietComfort 35 - it does have that metal band and it clamps down slightly more than the old model and some people don't like it as firmly on their heads again I didn't have a problem with it but some people do the Comfort round goes to Sony now what about sound quality if you're wearing headphones you want to hear your favorite music as clearly as possible now David had to test out sound quality or listening to lossless files streaming what in a lot of case we're doing more real-world where we're doing Spotify at the highest level possible title we also have about 20 tracks we listen to a lot of a be testing but we're pulling one headphone off and also some jury testing so we have a few people listen these is just not just me because I hear things a certain way I've certain tastes in music so then we come to some conclusions about the sound regarding that so the issue with it these all sound really good I don't think anybody's gonna be disappointed with the sound quality of any of these there are slight differences and slight first since the the sony is gonna got a more energy in the bass when you say energy in the bass what does that mean it's just got its it's got more um it's it's a well-defined bass but it's got a little bit more kick to it and for someone who listens to maybe hip hop and and you know EDM dance I always listen to you know that type of stuff it's is it's gonna it's gonna feel more visceral weirdly bose is not associated necessarily with an audio file type sound profile but this it's a very well-balanced headphone very clean sound and clear doesn't have as much energy in the bass so it's it's better to find bass than in the previous model to climb comfort 35 - not everybody is gonna like that as much this the sony is a little warmer headphone same goes for I would say the Sennheiser's you know another great sounding headphone a little bit more on the bass in terms of oomph to the bass and then you know you have the Bang &amp; Olufsen it has a little bit more detail in the detail you hear more travel you're in the higher note yeah so you know it might be say you're listening more jazz and classical music okay I want to hear it you want to hear the separation between the instruments very clear separation something like the baingan Olsen or the Bose is probably to give you a little bit better experience these are all wireless headphones there's a compromise with Wireless compared to compromise with both wireless and boys cancelling so you're degrading the sound buddy a little bit with with each so because you're adding the noise from the noise canceling on top of the audio you want to listen to in the first place so you're not exactly getting the pure audio you would have gotten if you were like sitting at home in a quiet room with headphones on alright so which one of these has the best sound quality I I'm gonna give it to the Sony because Sony coming back it's got a nice warm sound it's kind of forgiving in terms of you gonna listen to a lot of genres of music good detail again a little bit more kick to the bass that said all these are a close second alright Sony gets the win for this round now let's not forget these headphones are really great all the sound is very good it's very close but we're here to find the best of the best let's see who walks away the winner time for round five and that's value David what does value mean to you I mean I think it just is bang for the buck and when it comes to these these some of these models are very expensive today Nielsen is $500 that's 500 bucks it is the third generation of the headphone some of the earlier models there was a there was a previous h9 and there was an h9 i those wells actually sell for less soon if you if you really had your eye on this one you could probably wait it would come to a little bit in price the Sennheiser is $400 and the bose is $400 the Sony is at 350 but it's been around a while so it's really come down to $300 and sometimes you'll even see it for a little bit less as we're standing here today the Jabra is on sale for 250 it's usually 300 but I also expect that to come down in price but in terms of bang for the buck if because these are $100 less than the Bose we're saying these have a little bit more bang for the buck right now these are the Sony's we're talking there's a Sony WH a 1000 X and Mark 3 that rolls off the tongue it is a great headphone after five rounds the best noise canceling wireless headphone overall is the Sony WH 1000 X Mark three David let's recap what makes the Sony's the best of the best obviously a great sounding headphone of the most comfortable nice feature set it also delivers the most bang for the buck at this point thank you to David everyone who tried on the headphones and you great viewers let us know what you think of the results your voice is important and make sure to

102,d4JEWjgeazA,Beau Reviews Awesomeness: Funny Amazon Reviews,UCznVe3MnNBPvqHDNM86771w,★★★★★ Mpow bluetooth headphones review - Cheetah Sport 4.1 Wireless Headphones Earphone - Amazon,"23 : https://amzn.to/2uOaQPP 
🎥 Video review. 🎥

I review a lot of headphones, and these are my absolute favorite for working out. I pair these with my iPhone or MacBook Pro.

Product being reviewed: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WG0WXF2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00WG0WXF2&linkCode=as2&tag=beaureviawes-20&linkId=SYRGTGN2TVVW24B3

Pros:
✅ Stay in place and are extremely comfortable. I still have full mobility of my head.
✅ Long battery life. 
✅ Sound is awesome. 
✅ Look awesome. 
✅ Can talk on the phone with the them (note: audio quality is decent for a phone conversation.  I wouldn't use these for studio recording. See video.) 
✅ Nice folks at Mpow. They actually sent me these headphones to test and video review.
✅ Folds up compact.
✅ Very easy to pair via Bluetooth.

Cons:
🍅 If it's windy out it's hard to talk on the phone. Just keep this in mind if you're on a really fast run and you think you're going to be able to talk to someone on the phone!

Summary: 5/5 stars. Hands-down the best headphones you can buy if you're an athlete.

wireless sports headphones now all it is you could get from Amazon I'll put the links up in the description the prices range from 20 to 150 bucks so everything that you see in this video is 150 and under now of course these aren't the top ten on the planet these are just the top 10 that I actually own so if you had your eye on the pair and you don't see them in this video hit me up in the comments and we'll check those out later now I got 15 different sets of headphones I want to try out Father them ain't gonna make the cut the main question I want to answer in this video is that all of these headphones or any of them better than my favorite ones the power beats wireless 3 now these are running about 100 bucks so far these are my favorites the battery life is incredible fast charge is insane they sound great they look great but most importantly they don't fall out of my ears and that's a big thing for me with headphones they got to stay in my ears so right now the power beats 3 these are my favorites let's see if we got any one's better alright so we'll start off from the lowest price to the highest price first up we got the Aki magnetic wireless earbuds and he's gonna run you 20 bucks 10 hour battery life IPX 6 sweat-resistant shout-out to white shoes you got the day off here we go rah ok 20 bucks on these now I'm gonna try to make this video as quick as I

sound I'll test the call quality out also right now there's no specific order we're gonna do the top 10 at the end alright so let's see what it is with these alright sound it's a white shoe so much on the day off white sands takes no days off alright so 20 bucks on these I'm gonna try to make this quick this ain't gonna be a full review we're just gonna check everything out now this box is really trolling me let's see what you get inside okay so you got some these are the fins the wings I would call these the wings I should do your thing this is a microUSB charging cable 10 hour battery life on these okay so let's open them up real quick here we go okay so basically just some twenty dollars now this little sticker right here strollin ah basically just some $20 wireless headphones now the side note when I say wireless headphones I don't mean truly Wireless we already did those these are wireless they wired together but wireless from your phone okay so let me just make that clip alright so these are nice little length on these Aki Brandon let's see it looks like you got playing pause volume up and down now as usual I'm gonna pause the video I'm gonna pair them up do a little sound test and I'll let you know how they sound talk amongst yourselves alright so I just tested these out and honestly day I D Y day I alright em eh these is man day I basically they sound like some twenty dollar headphones they sound like the headphones that come with your phone just wireless all right so let's rate these real quick how do they fit not the most comfortable in the world the wings is pretty much trashed how do they look see for yourself man nothing fancy and how do they sound basically they sound like the headphones that come with your phone nothing special at all alright so if you serious about your workout game I would definitely pass on these these are make a nice little Christmas grab bag gift or if you just want some headphones to throw around or headphones to wear to the beach you don't care if they get broke or they get lost and they pick these up other than that I would pass on these all right so have to m house next up we got the m power sport bluetooth headphones now he's going to run you 25 bucks now he's pretty much looked similar to the powerbeats threes if I see let's check these out I shoes about to dip with the headphones all right here we go okay so let's see what these are now a matter of fact before I found the box to the side let's just check these out let's see you got our bluetooth version 4.1 operating range 10 meters standby time 22 hours charging time one and a half hours talk times seven hours charged DC five volt battery capacity 100 milliamps yeah that's pretty much it let's see ipx7 blah blah blah I'm trying to do this quick water-resistant it is what it is I see you got your usual books and [ __ ] let's not I'm trying to keep this moving I here's your different ear tips got a little case now what is this oh now this ain't bad this ain't bad 25 bucks with these headphones you get a little armband for your phone that ain't bad okay I mad at that let's see here's your headphones let's see let me make sure I don't break these taking them out now this packing right here this is not the best not the best packing this is gonna be your let's see oh now check this out these actually have lightning adapter ports now you look ya think I'm struggling back here look at this packing why would they do this why would they do this look at this alright in the interest of time let me just I'll just take them out then I'll just them out and I'll let you know how do you sound alright so I just tried these out and honestly they okay right they okay let's rate them real quick first of all the fit now one thing I will say they do fit perfectly I'd if you'd like the power beats 3 they're gonna fit exactly the same how do they look they look like a set of power beats die to set a knock off power beats and how do they sound they sound ok they definitely a little bit louder than your stock headphones they got a lot of bass but the bass is kind of muddy I just not that clean rich bass that's definitely money back you're not gonna want to rock these at max volume on a bass heavy song it's gonna sound like trash so basically 22 bucks again another set of throwaway headphones makes a nice little gift give them to the kids I would say the best thing about these is this little cable right here you see it has lightning adapter and micro USB I have to take these in the car and use them for something else I saw those out of em pow flames 22 bucks let's keep it moving next up we got another set of em pals these are the S tens alright 25 bucks on these ones Sports wireless headset let's see any specs music

here we go alright MKS tens now in power they need to step their presentation game up but again for 20 bucks Who am I to complain usual books and [ __ ] it's got a little pile a little far from a little carrying case let's see more stuff for jerks to play with different size earbuds the wings now these look like some little cheesy wings I'm already not feeling those micro USB charging cable and these have the magnetic clips alright kind of like the 1 plus bullets Wireless so this way when you're rocking them around your neck use the magnets and clip them together now I forgot to check one thing with those okie ones did they have a magnet let me look real quick yeah now I should have known that that was in the name the all key ones was magnetic also oh these are trash magnetic trash

rate them real quick how do they fit now these wings these are the cheap wings sitting I gotta fit that great they will fall out here is if you're going too crazy in the gym how do they look yeah see for yourself all right none fancy and how do they sound basically like the last ones that same muddy bass at maximum volume again if you're looking for a set of throw ways that have magnetic clips the needs is cool what if you're serious about your workout pass on all of these so far alright so so far haven't heard anything that blew me away yet let's keep it moving now in a side note I'm not gonna test the call quality for all these headphones because these are basically sports headphones that's made for you in the gym or main phone when you're working out doing some activities you up in the gym get you ass off the phone and workout alright stop going to the gym and talking on the phone who cares how to call quality sounds workout alright so next up we got the JBL tune 110 BT's pure bass

JBL tune one tens they do have a magnet lock together like that forty bucks on these basically these ones sound okay alright they sound okay I'm not blown away but they already sound better than order to empower ones so for 40 bucks I ain't really gonna complain first of all how do they fit they go right in your ear now if you're doing some back flips and all that they're gonna fall out how do they look see for yourself basically like a regular set of earphones and how do they sound they sound good they get a little bit loud the base is a little bit heavy but not muddy definitely not muddy as the EM house basically so far file all those end piles into the trash these gonna be number one on the list where are we gonna start the video with sound quality they okay they okay for forty bucks I guess I can see myself using these but we'll see how they rank at the end of the video alright so anyway let's keep it moving next up let's get into the raven flies sport reflex now he's gonna run you

your bike life you got a mic volume and dog track controls 25 hours worth of battery life you get a power bank that charges the earphones and USB devices I said I ain't bad comes with a power bank

headphones 50 bucks I like these alright so far I'm liking these ones let's rate them real quick as far as the fit they fit perfectly they not falling out here is by any means how do they look and see for yourself kind of stylish but how do they sound so far these are the loudest ones yet the base is nice and balanced but the base is kind of heavy alright I could definitely rock these to the gym alright and so far I like these ones the best 50 bucks I shoes to keep it moving alright let's see what we got next next up let's take it over to the JBL reflect mini tubes now he's gonna run you 80 bucks 10 hour battery life you got a mic for hands-free calling lightweight aluminum design hence we call sweat proof and reflectable cables all right now same thing with these these also have the reflectable cables matter of fact let's see if I can show you them let me pull out my flashlight let's try this I don't know if I can see that or not but they do reflect this is the lowest budget this

look they look nice you got the reflective cables that's one of the selling points but the sound the sound quality is just not worth 80 bucks alright all little ones I've reviewed so far I'm

coming to realize that brave and make some quality headphones how do they fit nice and comfortable I would have preferred if they had the wings so if you're doing your back flips they might fall out but it's a nice comfortable fit how do they look yeah this piece in the middle of these two pieces are kind of on the big side they look I like not the sexiest in the world but how do they sound so far these sound the best they're loud crystal-clear and the bass was booming and I could definitely see these as my daily headphones so far bravin's out of this 100 bucks alright let's keep it moving

out this what I'm talking about I like these kind of wings right here the ones that encapsulate the whole headphone I like those and since I sound like Jose okay let's see let's see what don't you get okay now look look at these braided cables I don't like that already these have a nice feel to them let's see what else you get okay nice carrying case inside here's your charging cradle now I'm not gonna follow this to the side cuz urk C's will snatch this up when you want to charge your headphones you have to put them in the cradle and then plug them in so make sure you don't lose this cradle or the headphones is worthless you can't just plug in the microUSB cable and of course you got your books in here blah blah blah okay so here we go now these have that little cable management clip on the back I like that too oh these look nice these look nice alright so let's try these on and we'll do a little sound test alright so I just check these ones out and honestly so far these are the best ones yet shoutout to Jaybirds they always make quality headphones this is another set of quality first of all how do they fit they fit perfectly now I was doing a little exercise trying to get them to fall out they will not fall out of my ears how do they look they look great I'd fit nice and snug very discreet that little cable management clip on the back you're gonna need that and lastly how do they sound they sound incredible check this out you're gonna need to download the j-bird app now from the app you got all your presets you see I had I just made one called base but if you want you could go to customize I had the highs mids or the lows once you change it on the phone it changes on the headphones and it's a dramatic change you know sometimes you're gonna eat you you put up to maximum base you just say a little bit more bass this EQ actually works when you take these headphones out of the box and you put them in with the stock EQ settings you're gonna say okay they sound kind of low go to the equalizer play with it they sound incredible set up your profiles and you got some more users manuals pa new headphones bunch of different stuff so far these are the best ones yet now the only downside just like all of my other jaybird headphones make sure you do not lose this charger or you're going to be asked out alright so right now the tower pros these are the best ones yet let's keep it moving next up we got the beats X now he's gonna run you 120 bucks eight hours worth of battery life let's see wireless Bluetooth eight hours battery fast charge five minutes gives you two hours with the battery multiple ear cups multiple multiple ear cup sizes flex point flex form cable shoes is killing my concentration control music manage calls right from the headphones

let's see if we get a troll stick or nut bump troll stick on deck and here's your headphones now these are actually the ones that have that kind of go around your neck field here we go okay so you rock these around your neck let's see do they have magnets be disappointed if they don't yeah they got magnets let's see now yeah they're magnetized together kind of like the one Plus bullets Wireless basically that same look now I didn't put this I didn't put the 1 plus bullets Wireless in the video because you can't bottles on Amazon and nobody got time to be on one plus dealing with the BS alright so let's try these ones out alright so I just tested out the beats X and I do like them but not for the gym and definitely not 420 bucks check this out here's the one plus bullets Wireless they look exactly the same that feel the same and they sound the same but the bullets are half the price and with the bullets you actually have wings so they're gonna stay in there is a little bit better than the beats X all right so let's rate them how do they fit they do fit nice and comfortably but if you're doing income benchpress or you're doing some activities we're sweating a lot no wings they're gonna pop out of your ears how do they look they do look nice all right simple and straightforward but the best part about these is the sound they sound great nice and loud heavy on the bass all right so I do like them but again for 120 bucks no and definitely not for the gym all right let's keep it moving now we're gonna get into five heavy hitters first up we got the v-moda bass fit Wireless now he's gonna run you 130 bucks 11 hours battery time you got three fit options let's see anything else wireless Bluetooth sweating water-resistant 11 hours play time Plus fast charge three sizes all right here we go epic failure just now look at this all right let me calm down now that's two major fails just now what am i doing alright here we go let's see what you get inside the box now these are let's see do they come stock like that okay here's your headphones kind of has the beats Wireless kind of look to it but this you're definitely gonna stay in the air all right I like the fin that's the dolphin fin right there let's see you get a nice little carrying case ventilate it okay oh now check this out this one I'm talking about now you got the real wings I'll just pop one out so you can see for yourself these are those real Wings labeled right and left margin' different sized air tips use your books and [ __ ] and a microUSB charging cable pretty much it okay I'll check these on they got magnets on it too perfect even the beats don't have the magnets all right so let's test these ones out all right so I just finished using the v-moda bass Fitz and I can confidently say so far these are the best ones yet these could actually replace my power beats three Wireless how do they fit perfectly I perfectly perfect fit these are not coming out of your ears no matter what you do you could do a decathlon right now and they're not gonna move how do they look definitely look cool now you see I got the the dolphin fin tucked under the Hat real nice and how do they sound the sound quality is amazing super loud extra bass even more bass than the power Beach three so right now these are my new number ones let's keep it moving next up we got the j-bird x-force now he's gonna run you 130 bucks eight hours worth of battery sweating waterproof Sport Fit Plus let's see anything else eight hours playtime sweating waterproof these are ipx7 Sport Fit Plus overall under the ears two different styles you can wear them comply ultra foam tips premium sound with custom EQ music and phone calls another side of Jaybirds you already know that eq is going to be popping let me grab the knife here we go Rob okay let's see if we could not get trolled with one box let me just open up one box easily here we go okay just like the Tarot pros let's see that it should be different in tips okay you got your real wings like real size wings bunch of different air tips and a cable management clip usual books and [ __ ] save those another cradle i USB charging cradle and a little carrying case and here's your headphones alright that wasn't too bad jaybird headphones x fullest now if these sound anything like the X 3s I'm about to be impressed alright let's test the map alright so j-bert x4 on a scale of 1 to 10 I'm giving these a major major major go I am definitely feeling these headphones shout-out to j-bird we got another win on deck ok how do they fit perfectly oh you're gonna love these wings no matter what sport or activity you doing they not gonna move around they're not gonna fall out of your is now you can use the comply foam tips if you want but I didn't even need them but these are dope how do they look sleek and stylish pretty good how did they sound that easting sound incredible just like the tower pros you got that same j-bird app playing with all the EQ settings if you go to headphones you got 5 my buds just get you lose them it'll let you know the last place you had them but again the key to these jaybird headphones it's all about the app use that EQ customize it to the way you like it these headphones gonna sound incredible now do I like them better than the V motor so far right now let's say the V motors are still the best these are definitely in the top five all right let's keep it moving alright next up we got the Bravin fly sport power now he's gonna run you 150 bucks sweat proof 20 hours play time Bluetooth and wireless let's see 20 of our play time with the power band I said that's gonna double as extra power you got adjustable ear hooks Pierce wirelessly ip67 dust and waterproof high Glo lasers you got laser beams ambient over the awareness smart app control quick-release cable all right so this little neck band that's actually extra battery power alright 150 bucks let's check these ones out okay now why do I keep tripping the bikes from the back I just maybe maybe it's an easier way it is what it is all right quick start god we just gonna have to unbox it and reverse let's see what you get in this little box first okay so here's your microUSB charging cable this is your carrying pouch okay you got some different earbuds let's see and here we go now this is gonna be this is your neck band with extra power now you don't have to rock this if you don't want to but what play wouldn't see how it feels and these are gonna be your headphones okay can I do this without breaking them alright it is okay now these look similar to the last bravin's what the wings are automatically built into it let me see can you disconnect them nope okay let's see how this works now this is gonna be this little you see the little cradle right here little pins go into this cradle I guess if you're doing some long-distance running in a long range training you might want to rock this for extra battery this looks kind of small I don't even think I could get this around my neck but try it out alright so I just tried out the Bravin fly sport powers and I got to keep a railroad job on a scale of one to ten these are a triple major go these are my new favorite headphones I shout out the brave in they did it again with three four three these headphones are incredible first things first the fit the fit is 100% perfect now I was a little bit concerned because this piece right is a little bit small I got a big neck giggity so I wasn't sure if it was gonna be too tight but it fits nice and snug and it keeps the headphones from moving around you also got the wings so once you get the wings locked in they not going to move now check this out let me power them on again this little battery piece is dope too because not just a neck guard it's actually a battery all right so let's turn the power on watch this you're gonna like this remember I said ladies of beam's these are the laser beams right here now if you're riding your bike in the middle of the night you're definitely going to be seen now check this out when you go to the app and let me open up the brave an app real quick let's go to the app let me connect these to the headphones now watch this I see you pair your audio we hit done got audio controls so you can change all the EQ settings you got ambient awareness so if you're outside walking around and you don't want to get hit by a car turn that on you turn on bass boost we'll talk about the sound in a minute but the bass boost is intense but check this out go to light controls you can actually change the laser beams you see that so this would be a couple of flashes in a long pause if you want you could just have it steady flashing or you could just leave it on so when I'm doing my bike light activities in the middle of the night I'm just gonna leave these on you got all that extra batteries so you don't have to worry about draining the battery how do they look they actually look nice all right so you see that piece is wrapped around the neck nice snug secure fit I like it but the best thing about these headphones is the sound so far these are the loudest ones and they have the most bass and when you add that bass boost this is gonna blow you away all right so one hundred and fifty bucks for these yeah this is a major major major go so far right now these are my new favorite gym headphones in the wireless department let's keep it moving we got two more next up we got the SOL run free Pro BIOS and he's gonna run you 150 bucks 11 hours battery life AI technology with real-time voice coaching now if you have you into running you're gonna like that voice coach in me personally the only time I run is when I'm running for the ice cream truck so I ain't gonna need that feature let's see what else you got supreme sound quality real-time voice coaching 11 hours battery life you got a reflective cable led safety light you got to be flex biomech engine for collecting biomechanics data what does that mean I don't know waterproof and weatherproof organ ama design for comfort and secure fit alright so 150 bucks let's check these out okay now what else got head angles symmetries step with shot vertical auscultation alright so if you into running you want to check these out now in the interest of time I'm not gonna make this into a full review if y'all curious about that stuff hit me up and we'll check it out later right now we're just going for sound quality look and feel I so here we go sole run run free BIOS I got a bunch of soul headphones same carrying case I let's see struggle in again inside here's your different wings now these are different wings I want to show you how to ease look in a second there's your ear tips microUSB charging cable okay good we got some wings already installed I like the sole wings better than all of the other wings and let me show you why okay what else it anything else and usual books and [ __ ] poison for the trolls file or lap all right I hate these little stickers now for the headphones that's one thing about these soil headphones that I notice they don't use the regular wings they use these kind of wings like look like this let's see if I can slap it on real quick not knocking the camera over let's see now I'm gonna have to take this piece off alright basically the wind goes like this matter of fact let me set them up I'll do a little test and then we'll talk more about them alright so I just used the sole run free BIOS and on a scale of 1 to 10 I'm giving these a double major go I like them but they're not my favorites alright so let's break it down first things first the fit now they do fit nice and snug on you is very comfortable they're not going to move around and they're not gonna fall out so if you run in you're good to go now me personally I like to wrap around wings a little bit better for when I'm doing the incline bench but these is good to go next the look they do look nice minimalistic style let's turn them on real quick I want y'all to see the lights I so want your power these up if you notice they do light up and you got reflective cables I so I'm definitely liking the look and you got the cable management clip real nice now for the sound the sound oneís is pretty good not the best unlike the V motors better I like the bravin's better but the sound is nice and loud a lot of bass but if you buy knees for running and you like that artificial intelligence with the voice coach the voice coach is crystal clear and super loud the voice is real natural it sounds like somebody's talking to you so again I'm not a runner but if you into running these might be the best for that our voice commands let's keep it moving all right so we got one more we got the bose sound sport now he's gonna run you 150 bucks let's go through the features dynamic wireless sound stable comfortable ear tips small medium and large sweat and weather resistance enhance headphones with the bose connect app in-line microphone and up to six hours per charge now if y'all watch my truly wireless video the Bose was my favorites so I'm hoping these might be the same here we go let's check these out now if you ever bought anything from Bose you already know what to expect quality take a nice little presentation right here I like that the tricep I should be getting it in alright here we go Bose sound sports now whenever you buy Bose headphones for some reason it was kind of big I remember two wireless ones the truly wild ones that was kind of big and I had the same reaction like this is kind of big but they blew me away so let's see if these are gonna do the same let's see what else you get okay you get a little carrying case with a carabiner hook let's see you got some more wings more ear tips well actually these are two sets of wings I see got large and small a little poison for the trolls and there's your microUSB charging cable any usual books alright so let's try these out matter of fact let me see maybe I show you the headphones first after all this is a review alright let's see you got NSC nice clicky buttons little people management clip with the Bose Lant logo on it I will peel these stickers off in a minute just a little bit on the big side let's hope we got big sound alright so let's try these out alright so I just used the bose sound sports and i got to be honest with job on a scale of one to ten here we go again these are a triple major go these are easily the best sounding ones yet let me break it down first things first the fit now was a little bit concerned because these are kind of big so i thought they was gonna fall out of my ears they do not fall out of here is now i really tested these i went on my income bench I tried to go upside down I'm trying to shake my head trying to get them to fall out they would not fall out I sort of fit it's perfect next the look now the look is a little bit on the big side as you can see for yourself but again I'll sacrifice those big earphones for big sound and speaking of the sound the sound door needs the bass is so clean and rich now the V motors might have a little bit more of a heavier sounding bass but if I had to pick one for overall sound the best overall sound I'm going with the Bose alright so we - four - shout out to Bose they got me again these are gonna be my new favorites let me show you something else real quick now you got the Bose app if you want to you can hit your headphones so say you and your girl ladies you and your man and Buffy I got a set of Bose headphones you can share the music right from the app to that bar - both headphones that's pretty dope and also you got your battery life you got your music and you got all your settings Bose has done it again alright so this what I'm gonna do I'm gonna pause the video I'm gonna set everything up and we'll rate them from 1 to 10 I'm pretty sure the Bulls gonna be my number ones I just want to test the V Motors and I want to test the bravin's one more time you know all through you side by side and I get back to y'all with the top ten all right so let's wrap this up and count off my top ten number ten on the list we got the brave in fly sports number nine we got the beats X number eight we got the jaybird tower pros number seven Sol run free BIOS and number six the power beats three Wireless now up until today these was my favorites they didn't even make it to the top five number five we got the Bravin fly sport reflex with the built-in power bank number four we got the j-bird x-force number three v motor base fits now these probably got the most based on all of them on the table with the wings these are major go number two the Bravin powers now any day of the week these could probably be my favorites I love the little laser beam lights you got the extra battery on the back the fitment is perfect these are beasts for the gym and number one the bose sound sports I both did it again these have the overall best sound crystal-clear deep rich bass when it comes to music these are the best anyway now if you didn't see the ones you like hit me up

headphones,2020-10-07 10:22:45.648801," what's up guys I'm Jeffrey the jet from risen is calm today we're talking about my favorite the best cheap true wireless earbuds let's jump to it okay so I'm sure you're well aware the fact that there are a million different cheap true wireless earbuds out there we've tested a bunch of them obviously we haven't tested them all so if you found some that are awesome that you really like make sure to write us down below in the comments you know we have this huge platform 400,000 people so you can help out all the other people that are watching today's video by writing the comments and letting them know yeah I found some that are awesome that belong on the list but I will tell you you don't have to go outside on my list these are gonna be your favorite I think that one of the four you're really really going to like and most of them are priced about the same as the famous ShamWow hi it's Vince with ShamWow you'll be saying WOW every time you use this towel anyways what are you looking for with cheap true wireless earbuds there's basically three things number one price right all of these are under $50 I think 50 bucks is the threshold for being considered cheap the second thing is they have to cover the basics right a decent Bluetooth range decent audio quality decent setup process they have to have you know all of the basics covered if you can expect them from really high-end headphones do they have somewhat of what you get from the $200 version or the $150 version so do they have the basics covered now the third thing is are they from a somewhat well-known brand I don't want to recommend brands that are gonna be gone tomorrow so these are from relatively well-known brands at least on Amazon and if we did find some that weren't from reputable brands we tried to find alternatives for you guys so I think that stuff makes sense to everybody and most people will agree on that and with that out of the way let's get to the first ones on the list I'm going with the J lab J butts air so these are my under fifty pick and the reason I like these and by the way we did do a full review of them so I'll link that in the description but the reason I like them is because they're from a very well known brand they're very affordable fifty bucks and they cover all the basics so a decent Bluetooth connection I find them to be pretty comfortable not the most comfortable at your buds I've ever tried out but certainly comfortable enough for 50 dollars they have okay audio quality plus they have three different audio profiles so you can cycle through like balanced the signature one which you'll probably like the most and then they also have a bass boost so they have okay audio quality they also have pretty good battery life so three and a half hours on a single charge and they come with the charge case that gets you about an extra 10 hours they are ip55 certified which means water and sweat resistance but my least favorite thing about them is probably the remote system and you'll see this as a recurring theme whenever I try any true wireless earbuds it could be expensive one it's like somehow the remote system because you just don't have a whole lot of real estate to work with just isn't that great so they do have a button it's not very clicky it's not very tactile and you do end up pushing the earbuds farther and farther in your ear so the remote system works it's just not my favorite and it won't be my favorite on any of them because most of the time the remote systems aren't that great on top of that when you go to take phone calls they won't take the phone calls in stereo mode they only take them in mono mode so you can take out one of the earbuds I think it's the left one you can take out or the right one you could take out I can't remember off not my head but one of them you have to take out when you take your phone calls that's actually really common though for true wireless earbuds usually you can only take your phone calls in mono mode so I guess they can qualify as one of those 2008 Bluetooth headsets from like jawbone or something but seriously for 50 dollars I do think they're probably the best ones that you can get right now now my second pick are under $45 and I really like them but I don't like them as much as the J buds air so I went with the taotronics TT so at out rocks pretty well known brand I think like Sunnyvale brands owns them or something but they make a lot of electronics on Amazon so I wear these and I do think they check a lot of the basics so yes they are comfortable they do come with a charge case that doubles as a power bank of 3,500 milliamp hour power bank so it can charge your other electronics so that's actually really nice I said they're comfortable the thing I don't like again is the remote system so they don't have a clicky or tactile button it is a touch capacitive system which kind of sucks so like double tap skip a track that sort of thing I think you are more than capable of mastering it I just don't think you'll like it now these are also ipx7 certified which means you can drown them in water down to a meter and they should be good to go like we didn't have any issues with you know water and that sort of thing so they are fully water and sweat resistance they have bluetooth 5.0 and we were really expecting it to have unbelievable Bluetooth range instability but really it's kind of just average like a lot of these cheaper true wireless earbuds it's like 30 feet and then they will disconnect but that's I think that's like the baseline of what you can expect and you can probably get that from all the cheap true Wireless your about so like 30 feet regardless of the fact that they have bluetooth 5.0 that said the inter bud connection is pretty good you always will encounter some disruptions but it's pretty good between the two different ear buds so the reason I went with these is that for anybody that's really penny-pinching and you don't spend $50 45 dollars for these maybe saves you a little bit of cash and they'll still be good for commutes for the gym for workouts you just can't expect everything they'll be pretty good a little tinny kind of shallow in terms of audio quality but they're okay my next pick are this Inari z5 so of all the brands on this list I know the least about Inari in fact I would have originally put on some ear buds from sound Pete's we did it last year I love those ear buds I tried to find them I can't find them if you check in the description I'll link all of these I'll try to find the sound Pete's but they had basically the exact same form factor as these and the reason I like them is that they have a very secure fit almost like like the powerbeats 3 so they go around your ear and they secure perfectly in your ear you don't have any issues so they're really great for workouts and I think they do a decent job with the remote system so you'll notice that they do have a center button but they have buttons on the top for volume so it means that they have a little bit more room for you to increase the volume or mess around with tracks and all of that so I like the form factor of these a lot they are $40 so I guess you're not saving a whole lot over the taotronics and again I would have preferred the sound Pete's like the original sound piece that we talked about last year but these are the closest that you're gonna get I think they're pretty freakin awesome though my least favorite part though is that they have a proprietary charger which I'll try to get shots this but at magnets onto the bottom I'm guessing for waterproofing purposes and it means that you have to have like some unknown charging cable they have to they give you two just in case you lose one but it just it's kind of weird to use some random charge cable you've never used before in your life so I preferred how the sound Pete's did it where they had a microUSB cable and you have to press and hold each time to connect them it's not that big of a deal but you have to do it every single time you want to pair them from their bluetooth quality pretty good like 30 feet and then enter earbud pretty stable from their audio quality it's basically the same it's so close across a lot of these earbuds probably the best on the J lab J buds but for these it's decent really liked any kind of shallow easy to distort the bass but um I guess you know if I was working with a budget of like 40 bucks and I wanted to work out with true while this earbuds I would be very happy with these they do a battery life of about four hours on a single charge that's pretty good they are ipx7 certified and they obviously don't come with a charging case because they use the cable and my next pick or the cheapest on list and I really like these because they're like $30 the sound Pete's true free now sound Pete's also makes another model that's a really similar they're the cue 32 s but those come with a charge case that's also a power bank I think you can save money save like ten fifteen twenty dollars and get the true freeze which are I believe the most popular true wireless headphones on Amazon so these things are pretty great I mean Johnny G behind the camera here the ease the one this is the ones you used right yes yeah I mean they're pretty awesome and one thing I appreciate is that they actually have a button that's pretty clicky attack Donna can we hear that yeah you can hear that okay yeah so it's got a nice little button there that I really appreciate they have battery life of about three and a half hours on a single charge plus I think like 10 or 11 in the charge case they're not water-resistant that's one thing you can wear them at the gym you just don't want to dump them in water or wear them in the rain or anything like that and as far as overall bluetooth stability goes yes they have bluetooth 5.0 but it's pretty much the same as with the taotronics right 30 feet then you'll have some sort of signal interference but inter earbud connection is large pretty good I think though for $30 these are the best true wireless earbuds you can get like I said I'll link them all in the description I apologize for not being able to find the around the ear ones that I love but I think I found a nice alternative Albia from a somewhat smaller brand oh and make sure to check out our website Rizzo's comm or you can download our completely free iOS and Android mobile app I've said this in a million videos but the fact of the matter is

112,p15UDqVOYBI,Best Buy,UC5pK3w6QEq1bUMmU2Hs43Pw,Tech Tips Remote: How to pair wireless headphones with a phone.,"Wireless headphones are great to use when you’re working from home. Geek Squad Agent Villegas will walk you through all the steps to pair Bluetooth headphones with a phone. He’s using a Samsung Galaxy Note 8, but the steps will be similar on many phones. Running into issues? He’ll also suggest what to do if your headphones won’t pair.

I'm Agent Villegas. I'm here to show you how to pair your Bluetooth headphones with your phone, and go over a few common issues. The first thing you're going to want to do is put your headphones to pairing mode. Your manufacturer should have some instructions on how to do this. The next few steps are performed on your phone. I'm using a Galaxy Note 8, so my screens and steps may be a little bit different than yours, but still pretty close. So first, you're going to want to find and open Settings. Next, tap on Connections, and then Bluetooth. If your Bluetooth is off, like mine, go ahead and tap on the switch to turn it on. Once your Bluetooth is turned on, you'll see a list of available devices. Scroll to find your headphones, and then tap on them to start the pairing process. Next, confirm that you want to pair the headphones by tapping OK. And there you go. Now your headphones show up as a paired device that you can use. Sometimes your headphones may not show up in the list when you're trying to pair them. First, make sure your headphones are still in pairing mode. If that still doesn't work, you may need to move to another location where there's less interference. If your headphones and phone stop working together you may need to unpair, remove, or forget the headphones from your phone. To do this, go back into the Bluetooth settings on your phone, tap on the gear icon next to your headphones, then tap Unpair. Your phone may say remove, unpair, or something similar.

as Jeffrey the jet today we're doing our annual video about the best workout headphones now if you're new to the channel you should know that we have tested dozens of headphones from some of the biggest and smallest brands out there and I'll link some of those reviews down below in the description and while you're down there make sure to hit that big red subscribe button you know you're probably gonna love everything that we have planned for the future and we just hit 100 million views it's pretty incredible you know we also have a monthly giveaway Club where we end up doling out a bunch of really nice headphones if you want to figure out how you can enter to win check out everything in the description basically it all starts by you subscribing anyways so these are our favorite workout headphones at least according to our team obviously there are a lot of headphones out there a lot of really good ones we can't pick them all but these are the four best now I will put a list of some honorable mentions down below in the description as well but I doubt you'll need it because there's no better than the best let's get to it [Music] okay so enough with the wind-up let's get right into the list I should tell you though at the end of the video we'll talk about my personal favorite our best overall workout headphones this year first up though we have the beats power beats 3 and these are what I'm calling our safe pick yes they've been out for 2 plus years but if you don't want to do any research and you just want a solid pair of workout headphones these are the ones to get you can stop watching the videos now they're not perfect but they're definitely good enough for most people they have great battery life it's like 12 hours on a single charge and they have a quick charge feature like 5 minutes we'll get you an hour worth of play back the audio quality it's passable the fit I think it's comfortable pretty secure they also are water and sweat resistance and they have great Bluetooth range and stability I think they're just overall solid workout headphones I guess the big downside with the power beats 3 is that they're pretty pricey the MSRP is $200 that said I have seen them for cheaper I think I've seen them as low as 99 bucks I'll link them in the description you can check them out for yourself see if the price has gone up or down whatever you can also head on over to our website Rizzo's calm or download our completely free iOS and Android mobile app what we do is every single day subscribers you're well aware of this but we source the 100 best deals now we don't sell anything we just find amazing deals on products you actually care about like from Bose Beats jaybird Apple and the list goes on and we save people a ton of money so the links to that stuff are down below in the description I really think you'll like what we're doing there and we update it every single day if not multiple times per day ok so next up are my favorite budget - your headphones and I've mentioned these in several other videos they are the anchor sound buds slim plus now I personally have and use the sound bud slim plus sort of as like my backup headphones because I have to have backups of everything anyways these things are 30 bucks they're one of the best selling headphones on Amazon I'll link them in the description they have a comfortable secure fit they're good for the gym they're good for phone calls they're good for walking around probably not my favorite running headphones but they're great for cycling now the alsa pretty good Bluetooth range instability and battery life is passable it's about seven hours on a single charge and I think they fully charge in about an hour and a half now they are also IPX I certified which is like water and sweat resistance although as I learn with my first pair they are not rated for putting in the washing machine so don't do that still they have a 99% positive rating on Amazon and for $30 I really really like these headphones especially now because I'm having to save for a wedding that's right baby I'm getting married and if you want to see the engagement video I'll put that down below in the description now we have the best true Wireless workout headphones and I'm going with the jlabbe epicair elite now these are the ones that Owen our boy here mister deadlift himself these are the ones he uses they're pretty awesome we did do a full review of them and I'll put that in the description as I've mentioned for pretty much everybody else but what you need to know is that they're by a comfy secure fit kind of like the power beats 3 the audio quality is pretty good considering their true wireless sound isolation is on point the battery life is 6 hours on a single charge which is great for true wireless headphones and then they have an additional 32 hours of battery life inside their charge case which doubles as a power bank so you can charge your other electronics now I don't like the remote system it's kind of finicky it's almost always pretty bad on true wireless headphones but the wireless signal is good I mean both between the earbuds themselves and to your Bluetooth device so you can walk like 50 feet and you have a strong connection there they aren't cheap but I wouldn't call $150 egregious in fact I think jlabbe is gonna be winning with these things we're gonna win so much and last but most certainly not least mostly because they're my favorite my best overall pick are the j-bird Terra Pro which I just did a review of it's not recency bias I just really like them I'll put that review in the description here's what you need to know about them they have great battery life it's like 14 hours on a single charge and they have a quick feature so five minutes of charging gets you two hours of playback time they're completely water resistant down to one meter so ipx7 certified you also get bluetooth 5.0 they have an excellent audio quality especially for a wireless workout headphones and within that jaybird app you can actually adjust the EQ settings I've mentioned this in many many videos but I like the fact that if you're listening in a country you can customize the sound signature for country which I do and if you're listening to rap that rap crap you can put more bass or do whatever the kids do nowadays and so basically you can customize the entire EQ settings and it follows the headphones not your Bluetooth source so let's say you go from your phone to your laptop you're gonna have that same sound signature they also have a durable braided cord with an adjustable fit which they call switch fit so you can wear them in the around the ear position for workouts which I prefer and then in the under ear position for like phone calls or maybe even to like calm down at work the one thing that I don't really like about the Thar Pro is that unlike some prior jaybird products they don't come with foam ear tips now those are the pinnacle in my mind in terms of sound isolation and comfort and fit but they just come with silicone ones I think they're passable they're fine everybody will like them but me being a stickler and somebody that gets caught up on like random little things I wish that they had the foam ear tips and know they are not compatible with other foam tips from other jaybird products still they have a very secure comfortable fit even for extended use yes they're a bit more expensive like a hundred and sixty dollars but for me they're hard to beat the only thing I will say is that you if you don't want to pay up for the tarah Pro I would actually probably skip maybe the x-force and save a ton of money by getting the x3 I don't know if you guys can see that but I use these for over two years in fact I sometimes still use them and I prefer when you put them around your ears you can string it up the cable up against the back your head and it almost forms like a true wireless experience so yeah these are 160 but if you want to save some money and get a similar experience not all of the features of tarah Pro but some of them I think I see these for under a hundred bucks often and I'll link them in the description so that's my list let me know what you think like I said I do it every year and so I'd appreciate your feedback I think I'm 100 percent correct mostly because I'm never wrong so I'll see you guys next time have a good day [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music] [Applause] [Music]

650 BT Bluetooth wireless headphones that's quite a bit of a mouthful for the model number this is pure wireless headphones they are bluetooth compatible but they don't have a 3.5 millimeter auxilary wire unfortunately but that's kind of okay with cell phone players just not so great for some people that don't have Bluetooth compatible laptops this is priced at $129 us and 199 Canadian but I do suggest and candidly look for a sale price like I did Sony advertises that this has about 10 meter range which is about 32 feet I'll say that's pretty accurate unfortunately there's no traverse pouch included out of the box keep in mind these are based specialty headphones they're designed for extra bass in fact it's even written on the box I had a bit of a concern because these headphones are incredibly light they felt kind of cheap and I was afraid they're gonna break fortunately that's not the case they've actually survived with me through a few flights I put them in my bag every single day and that helps that day cups do rotate for easy portability and packing anywhere you need to actually pretty sturdy surprisingly the top band has a layer of cushioning so if you're someone that has very little hair or no hair at all you won't be irritated by the band because that soft cushioning is quite thick and feels nice the same can be said about the earphone cups there's a lot of thick cushioning like really really thick which makes it incredibly comfortable my ears only get hot after three to four hours of continuous use it doesn't matter which size head you have there's some great flexibility here the Flex in general is fantastic it doesn't feel like it's going to break the ear cups themselves has some good rotation of going up and down they can rotate left and right so you pretty much set in regards to which head type you have and the band's do extend rather lengthly if needed while wearing on the headphones are rather comfortable they're not too big and bulky and they actually look pretty attractive they have some really nice colors from Sony one thing that's really important to mean for a lot of people I guessing as well is if you wear glasses these headphones are still really comfortable they are not irritating at all I find them to be very comfortable and I one thing to keep in mind is that they are available in red and black colors as well I find that Sony did a great job of making them it rather attractive it doesn't matter which color you get a lot of the functionality and control is pretty much on the right speaker now starting on one far edge we have the LED notification which if it's a solid red wall as charging means it's recharging if it's blinking means it's turning a pair of Bluetooth pressing and holding the volume button for two seconds turns it on pressing and holding it for seven seconds turns it on and puts into bluetooth pairing mode there's a microphone which I'll get into later on there's a micro USB port for recharging the device and of course their volume control buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume and while it's on your ears it's actually easy to navigate because the plus volume indicator has this little notch on it so it's easy to feel at all the glider is also a button so you can glide it you know forward or back for going to the previous track or the next track pressing it in will play or pause a song or pick up a call or hang up the call and all these buttons are pretty easy to navigate whilst on your head because they're placed really well they all have the different type of feel to them so you can just kind of touch them naturally when it's on your ear on the left side there is an NFC chip so if you have say a NFC compatible cell phone simply tapping yourself on what the Bluetooth headset will automatically pair it in one tap so these are on the ear headphone types so they're not really designed to cancel a lot of exterior noise but they do is somewhat okay job but that's not really a big deal one thing is really important to me is when you have them on your collar keep in mind in this segment I have a pretty thick hoodie so the call is rather thick move my head left and right is still rather comfortable despite them being a little bit higher than usual putting the head down is a little bit of an annoyance just a tad bit because your chin will rub against the speakers and no fooling the speakers in is not a good idea because they tend to rub against your neck now sony advertises that the batteries in this device last about 30 hours and i have to say it's pretty accurate based on my testing and results over the last few months now to recharge of the device sony does include a one and a half foot cord which is a micro USB cord unfortunate there's no power adapter sony wants you to recharge this device through a computer only which is incredibly weird to me i don't understand that so i do not recommend you hooking this up to say recharging through your cell phone or tablet charger as you might blow the battery just to be safe now it does take about three hours to fully recharge the battery which is really long but let's do some calculation one hour of recharging gives you then about 10 hours of playback when are recharged gives you roughly four to five hours of playback so the trade-off isn't bad while the device is on even if you're listening to music pressing the power button just giving a quick tap we'll have an audio playback and tell you if the battery level is high low or medium as mentioned earlier there's a microphone and there's a pickup and hang up button on the side and based on my testing I noticed that the person on the other end of the call will complain that the person with the headphones kind of sounds a bit distant a little bit echoey furthermore if there's a lot of background noise it's really difficult to hear what you're saying but I can't really complain as either designed or as headphones I just find as more as a bonus function as mentioned earlier these headphones are designed mostly for bass playback and they do a fantastic job of pushing bass it's not over-the-top so doesn't really ruin the song that you're listening to mids and highs are just okay but if you listen to something like say rock which maybe it doesn't emphasize a lot of bass for example it does not ruin the quality I'm really impressed with the quality overall with these headphones increasing the volume like a crazy amount even if you want to go deaf honestly it doesn't distort I'm actually really impressed that you know high volumes are still getting crisp clear sound when it comes to streaming TV shows or sports it's just okay you can't really expect much right listening to movies we're all still the same thing it's just okay but when it comes to listening to action movies you could be in for at really one to say explosions because explosions tend to have a lot of bass behind them so overall these headphones are fantastic but they have some weird problems that kind of set it back it does not support axillary port now I know a lot of devices you can listen to music from you know like spud cell phones for example or Bluetooth compatible but what if one is to do it on your computer not all computers are Bluetooth compatible the other thing is that there's no traverse pouch included with this device you know they could included one it wouldn't cost Sony just a few dollars in manufacturing to add it in the box the other thing is that there's no power adapter including the Box weird doesn't make any sense overall it's a great set of headphones worth checking out especially because they are wireless but those small things kind of keep it back from being perfect obi-wan this video is full if you

XT,2020-10-07 10:22:45.649041, hey everyone welcome back to another one of my videos finally I'm starting to see the momentum and truly wireless earphones and I'm not talking about Sennheiser but I'm talking about truly wireless earphones having better connection better battery life and slowly getting more high-tech than ever before this video I have the jaybird vistas that j-bert sent over this is the press unit that was showing in video here not the retail packaging so keep it in mind but as always being transparent I'll be going over both pros and cons like every video my assessment was not altered in any way at the time this video they're going for a hundred and seventy nine dollars retail if you want to check prices click on my links down in that video description below for the most updated prices in real time you never know when these things might go on sale I'm Jimmy with Jim's Ruthie room and I'm here to help you make that purchase decision welcome everyone to another video hey folks before getting started here it would mean the world to me if you guys can follow my social media handles at Twitter and Instagram the addresses should be on your screen right there now those are my personal accounts so you can follow my journey through life here hopefully it motivates you to pursue your dreams as well I'll place the links also in that better description just tap and follow that would help support my work thank you very much so folks let's get into the physical features first jaybird emphasizes they may be vistas as light and as small as they could compared to the competition indeed the vistas are small and they don't stick out of my ears but they are roughly equal to the best out there it's not class-leading but still very good comment down below on what you guys think how do these look now the ruggedness comes back but this time Jaipur claims it's even more diesel this still has the IP 7 certification meaning this can be submerged underwater up to 3 point 3 feet and up to 30 minutes now I tested this and there's no issues so far this girl has that sweat protection against your salty and sour secretions here I were these in the gym had some nasty ears wet one that never fell out of my ear and two they're still working fine we'll see overtime the new editions apron is calling it's earth proof the earphones capsule is essentially sealed against dust and grit now if you're watching this video in the future here come down below and let us know if these things are still going strong now as for comfort and stability these do work well with the newest silicone design the are comfortable these earphones don't Jam into the ear canal for stability instead they fit snug on the outer opening of your ear and the rest of the body somewhat rests on the bottom of ear right here now I also test both the large ear fin here and also the smallest one which only has a little nub and as you can see on screen either one space in the ears really really well now also testing this inserting runs and other vigorous movements never had an issue with the earphones losing its audio seal now speaking of its seal please provide very good passive noise isolation now it's such a bass on the button lay up this was not a hundred percent for me here you do get pause play and skipping forward on your songs but if you look at these awesome cards that I drew in after-effects here it's either or you can't have two actions that you might personally want for example I want to keep pause and play but I really want Google assistance so the only option I have is switching to double press for my voice assistant but then I lose the ability to skip a song now indeed you can use Google assistant to go forward and back on your play list but a double tap then you have to wait about a second or two here and then you say the command verbally out loud it just simply wasn't intuitive touch controls or at least at a minimum a physical button is preferable having all the actions at your fingertips would be the most ideal instead of picking and choosing here now what you also notice is lacking what the earphones its environmental pass-through you don't have your microphones kicking on where it pumps in your environmental noises for situational awareness now that feature is predominant on most other competitors and is perfect for runners who want that option or those who walk to work and want situational awareness so you don't get hit by a bus or a Toyota or someplace fats you just don't get it with the vistas now Jaber tries to make up for this by offering each earphone to work independently you can take either one of these earphones out and still have audio now getting into bluetooth performance I think we can finally say most competitors are very much making this effort here Bluetooth 5.0 is featured and the connection is excellent with your phone j-bird implemented this thing called jbs one wireless technology in hopes to fix connectivity issues testing this with it by 1100 square foot apartment here I'm able to get 98% coverage with the signal going through several walls over here now with video on both Apple and Android for both YouTube and Netflix that I tested all of them play perfectly with no syncing delays and that appears everything is fixed and I will admit it does seem to have improved over the previous generations but I did encounter an issue of having the earphones connect to another device jaybird says this can't remember up to 8 devices that's awesome here but switching between let's say my pixel to my iPhone and vice-versa it can be spotty with no success at times or even at times it establishes the connection but then the audio stops playing for summary but the actions like pausing and playing volume adjusting and such it still works so just look out for that when you're switching devices now last but not least before I move from the signal performance here jaybird only has SBC we don't get apdex or higher to support higher resolution audio files and streams of course but as usually uh what I say here in specs aren't everything so let's wait into the audio section I'm gonna review so let's get into the battery performance here jaybird is climbing up to six hours of use per charge here with my testing at 50% vine from full to dead I get six hours in three minutes to be exact now you get additional 10 hours with each rechargeable carrying case giving you a total of 16 hours fast charging is available with five minutes on the charger giving you back an hour worth of playtime now these numbers are not industry-leading but they are still on the upper end now speaking about this case right here this uses USB C and if you like minimalism or at least something not clunky the earphones and the case itself has this very slim profile here and it works really well also we're keeping the earphones in place the magnets are quite strong now folks let's talk quickly about the app now this is no question one of the best apps in the industry Jabra Sennheiser in what Sony here has some great ones as well but what makes them all great though is how they make your earphones high-tech so going on to the main page right here you have your presets for EQ settings the most anticipated and most unique feature is the personal EQ that the app can generate for you when you go through this for the very first time here the app will play a series of tones and hums here in various frequency ranges as soon as you hear that little hum click Next and if you go through the entire range the app gives you a personal EQ setting now somewhat similar to the newer phones that are reviewed before but this puts it in your hands you can say it's been consistent for me and with my ears the app is usually suggesting here I prefer or I like upper bass and a slightly raised high frequency now from my experience and years of testing audio I know I personally do tend to like a little bit more bass in my music and forward upper mids the app is accurate in a general sense here but it sounds it's a little extended for me I typically have to pull down both Peaks for it to be my sweet spot for those who are interested this is where I usually keep my EQ settings on this app but anyways overall for those who are not familiar with what they like this app although it's not a hundred percent but it surely can give you a general sense but more my audio test very soon let's see how these sounds a little bit later continuing with the app here then back to the main page the next important section are you curated playlists that links to your Spotify account the last section of importance is the headphone screed which allows you to customize the buttons as I mentioned earlier now find my buds which is awesome here if you lose these things the app will show you where it was last seen the only thing though that I wished was available as if these earbuds itself Kim sure just in case these little things dropped under the bed sofa what have you here and you can't find it use the audible little chirp feature here and you can find it within the vicinity you don't get that here but at least we get this GPS geolocation finding feature now back it up voice prompts and tones are accessible in settings allowing you to hear things like battery level status in your earphones or tones when your earphones turn on or off this was also a welcomed positive feature as well but let's get into the audio related stuff here first up is the microphone test a lot of you guys always are interested in the phone call test before doing so please be sure to visit the video description and follow my personal social media accounts again for Twitter it's JLo official and for Instagram my profiles Jimmy look official alright folks fire modes down the comment section and here we go I will admit these do pick up a lot of background noise but also note though the microphones aren't necessarily fighting to isolate my voice with the background so it's not 100% perfect but then it give or take do you want consistent voice performance but unfortunately picks up background noise or do you want that kind of like cutting in and out experience so guys let me know down the comment section below what you guys think of how these your phone sound all right back to the studio all right now jumping into audio performance now for those who are familiar with j-bird it's a very similar experience loud in your face alive and energetic it's perfect for pop EDM in hip-hop starting with base these are bass boosted even in its stock level of course you can bump this up to a pretty significant degree with the EQ either flat or increased jaybird offers a very punchy and fast bass experience because of how well you can tune these this can go from flat or neutral to bass boosted and spilling over to the mid-range or you can actually have a go overboard or actually have it very much underwhelming the level of customization offered can very well satisfied those on either spectrum for bass either light or bass boosted now getting into the mid-range I love how separated forward and bright these can't become vocals and instruments have the ability to stand out not only being in the forefront of your music but audio separation from the lows and behind frequencies now as I mentioned earlier in my other review specs doesn't mean everything and although this only has SBC the engineer and how the audio is experienced is where it really matters the clarity is there now as for high frequencies it's good but can be sensitive at times on select songs with tracks that have a lot of instruments beads vocal work on the very upper end there it can get slightly jumbled for the most part it's never been bad I never experienced any ear screeching tinging or rasp enos up top now at this price point the sound stage is good and has a moderate degree of openness to be upfront the bose sound support frees and sennheiser truly wireless Momentum's do a slightly better job in offering that spatial experience so overall for the price functionalities rug this size the jaybird vistas are really really good there are some shortcomings the parent to another device here was slightly funky on very few occasions and the lack of that environmental awareness as a feature was a bit of a letdown as well but everything else about these earphones I'm very much enjoyed if you're on the market I would give these in recommendation or at least a consideration if you can work around those shortcomings there folks be sure to follow me on social media again the addresses are on your screen in in the video description below as always light up the comment section more fire mogees and I will catch you on the next one bye

▬ ABOUT THIS VIDEO ▬
BeatsX Wireless Headphones Review! In this BeatsX Wireless Earphones review, we discuss the top features of these Beats headphones. Yes, Beats by Dre and Beats audio are expensive but these could definitely be perfect for someone who is looking for a pair of Beats wireless headphones or Beats eaurbuds to wear all day long. However, I wouldn’t go as far as putting them on the list for Best Beats Headphones or Best Wireless Earphones just yet. The top features of these Beats by Dre wireless include their magnetic buds and form factor, fast fuel charging capability and that they charge via a lightning cable. The Beats X Wireless earbuds also have 8 hour battery life, they pair will apple devices extremely easy, sound isolation is solid, audio quality is pretty good and the in-line remote and mic are very easy to use. The range and Bluetooth stability are also pretty good with these Beats X Headphones. Overall, we really like these headphones. Do not get these to work out in as they are not sweatproof and thus will probably not be considered for the Best Workout Headphones 2019. They are probably better for someone in an office all day or who drives a lot. When it comes to BeatsX Wireless vs. Powerbeats3, I’d personally choose the Beats Powerbeats3 myself but for some people they may choose the BeatsX in the BeatsX versus Powerbeats3 discussion. I’m not sure if these will make the list for Best Wireless Headphones 2019 or Best Bluetooth Headphones 2019. Hope you enjoyed this video.

earbuds|beats by dre headphones,2020-10-07 10:22:45.649090, what's up guys I'm Jeff Rizzo for is news calm today we're talking about the five most legit features of the beats X Wireless these are the latest headphones from beats and I think that you're really going to like them and we wanted to cover the best features about them before we get into it make sure you subscribe you're going to love this channel we're rolling out a lot more reviews and all sorts of other great content that you're going to love so if you're in the beats products you're going to be into this channel red button is down below let's get to it alright before we get into number one if you're looking for a banking deal on beats products jaybird running shoes computers technology outdoor products check out rizz nose comm I can almost guarantee you we will find a discount on these or some other comparable headphones right now so check out resumes column that's our website we're going to scour the internet to find you the best deals and everything the link is here on the screen click it when you get a chance alright on to number one and number one on the list is magnetic earbuds so I love the form factor of these headphones the concept of these headphones you're supposed to be wearing them all day long I think of my good friend Brian who runs a limo company hey they just hang around your neck and when you need them you pop them in you take that phone call you listen in your music whatever I think of the office work or somebody that just wants to have headphones on them all day long and it's super convenient to just put them in and out of your ears and the fact that they have little magnets at the end of each bud means you can always find your headphones so a nice little addition they're having magnets of the tips good job beats number two we get fast fuel charging it shows up again on the BTEC we saw it on other beats products that's where you plug these guys in for five minutes you get a full two hours of playback time on that which is awesome it's like mind blowing fast feel charging one of the best thing since sliced bread huge fan of that and we plug them in for like nine minutes 10 minutes 12 minutes something like that and it charged them all the way up to 75% so if you're wondering they charge very quickly I think it's like right around 40 minutes 45 minutes and you an entire full charge and just in case you're wondering about that whole battery life on these guys is eight hours so pretty good we actually were getting just over eight hours so decent battery life not amazing but for headphones this small with a tiny form factor that's pretty good battery life and these are the first beats product to feature a lightning port so that's how you charge them with your iphone cable makes it super convenient you only need one cable to charge these when you're traveling or you know daily as opposed to always having a second cable on you I think that it made sense for beeps to go with a lightning cable here coming in at number three is the pairing process again we've seen this on the other beats product and that is they are mindlessly easy to set up you hold one button down for like one or two seconds you pair it with one device that's connected to your iCloud account and you're set up you don't have to do it again you go to set up on your iMac or your macbook and these headphones are already ready to go so I like to think about these as being grandma proof that's not true Matt Ross coined that phrase so I'm going to give him credit for that Matt Ross says their grandma oh sorry friendly grandma friendly that's how easy these are to set up I love the pairing process much more simple than other headphones out there that is if you're an iOS user if you're not an iOS user you probably shouldn't look into these headphones even though they will work with your device it's just that the pairing process some of the other advantages means that you're going to be an iOS user if you get a beats product going forward number four where's number four let me know if you actually get that reference write me in the comments number four is the sound isolation is awesome you're not going to hear your boss who's yelling at you on the daily because the sound isolation is really good they completely seal off your ear canal and for me the fit is pretty good although your ears are different from mine Matt's ears are different from mine and that means that you know person to person that is going to be a little bit different for me I like that they're contoured so they fit nicely into my ears and if you really do need a little bit extra in terms of getting them to fit and stay in your ears beat sends along a few extra ear fins so can help with locking them in your ear but I think the sound isolation is bar none I think I mean it's not even active found isolation it's just the fact that the buds completely seal off your ear canal and then also the fit is pretty good and I think these are some of the best beats out there in terms of the sound quality I mean not a great I've obviously heard better buying the mids are pretty good highs are pretty decent and the lows obviously the bass is pretty darn good on these even when you get to those higher volumes now here and there you can hear distortions you get sounds a little bit shallow and raspy and muffled but pretty good audio quality on the beat sax last up here is something that was a little bit surprising to me and that is that they have an inline remote in mic so typically on these type of headphones you'll see the buttons and everything right here on the neck cable went on the beats X it's here on the main cable that does a few things for you makes it a little bit more convenient to access buttons for track management and volume and Siri and pause play love that and it means that when you plug them in you have them right into your ear here the microphone is closer to your mouth so the sound for the person on the other side I actually just played a song right there the person on the other side of the phone call actually hears you a little bit better so I think those are smart move by Beats to incorporate that into these headphones so those are the top five features of the beats X wireless here's my verdict on them if you're into these types of headphones you're down with the around the next portion you'll like having headphones you're going to wear all day long I think these are a pretty clever option this is not super rigid but I think it keeps its form factor good enough they're not workout headphones they're not sweat resistant so if you're thinking about using them at the gym I think they'll be fine but you probably should look into other headphones like the power beats 3 which by the way we've seen some discounts on or some jaybird products so if you're thinking about them for the gym you might look elsewhere there all day wireless headphones other things when you're looking at these is the bluetooth stability in the range so I mentioned the pairing process is super easy but also when you're using them I think the range is pretty good right around 100 feet and then you will here disruptions and then the stability is pretty good too so walls and doors and people won't really get in the way unless you're on like the fringes the outer edges of what these can take in terms of the limit of the Bluetooth so I think pretty decent Bluetooth with these headphones at a hundred and fifty dollars that might be you know the deciding factor price point if you like them enough $150 might be right I think the price point is pretty decently moderate but that's up to you write me down below in the comments I'll see you guys in the next video make sure to subscribe have a great day [Music] [Applause] [Music]

headphones|wireless earbuds|indy truly wireless|indy truly wireless skullcandy|skull candy indy|indy wireless earbuds,2020-10-07 10:22:45.649159, everyone Tim Schofield here and today we are going to unbox and take a look at a new pair of wireless headphones and when this company reached out to me I was actually feeling a little nostalgic because I actually owned a pair of their headphones back around middle school time so it's been a while since I've tried out a pair of their headphones and they are going with the wireless headphone trend truly wireless as you can see that company is Skullcandy they came out with the indie wireless headphones which we are going to unbox and take a look at today I do want to give a shout out to skull candy they are the sponsors of this video and also thanks to them for sending these over to check out it's also worth mentioning that these headphones are competitively priced at $79.99 I will link to them down below so we're gonna take a quick look at what comes in the box of the indie headphones along with the easy pairing process with them as well let's go ahead and get started [Music] to begin we'd like to show off what you get inside the box with these indie headphones on the front up to 16 hours of battery-life ip55 dust and water resistant rating and they have touch controls so if you go ahead and open this up lets you know how you can pair the headphones and also how to use those touch controls to change the volume skip tracks and play pause on the right side here you get your carrying case and of course your indie headphones underneath the headphones you do have your user guide along with a USB type aid a micro USB cable and some extra ear tips as well if you have a different sized ear so that these headphones will stay inside your ears so here's a look at the carrying case that you get says Skullcandy it looks like you have three LED indicators which will let you know the power status of it and the case will actually charge your headphones when you put them inside up to 12 hours of usage charging out of the pack itself and then you do have the charging slot down at the bottom there's a bit of a magnetic mechanism to the lid so you don't really have to worry about it flying open it will actually stay shut finally the Skullcandy indie headphones themselves you'll see the logo is where you will use those touch controls also worth mentioning it does come with some extra tips here which you can take off if you do not need them however I'm going to leave them on to help it be a little bit more stable in my ears putting the headphones in the carrying case themselves you'll see right away it actually activates those indicator lights on the headphones and on the battery case letting you know that it is now actually charging your headphones finally let's go through the pairing process so press and hold these two for about four seconds and you'll see this LED indicator lights start to blink now I'm gonna go ahead and grab my phone turn on Bluetooth and it should be able to find it there it is in D just go ahead and select it to pair and there we have it it looks like it is connected for calls and audio 50% battery remaining so I will need to put it back in the case to actually charge it and we are all set ready to go that was actually really simple to pair with my phone these indie headphones are also very light so I've never had a problem wearing them for an extended period of time when I am moving around a lot you can really barely notice them and they also never fall out they suction very well in my ears also which adds to the noise isolation that they have the noise isolation is very good so whether you're trying to study in a loud coffee shop or you're sitting on an airplane this does a good job at isolating that sound that's coming through the headphones because it really does block out that sound around you I find it's really helpful when working out because it really isolates the music coming to your ears so you can really just focus on the music and getting your lifts in and speaking of working out like I said these have that ip55 rating so if you are starting to sweat or you get sweat or a little bit of water on these you don't have to worry about them breaking the indie headphones have bluetooth 5.0 and also a 33 foot range so you generally don't need to have your phone on you at all times when listening to music or even a podcast anything like that so if you want to set your phone down somewhere or whatever you're connected to walk around maybe you run over to the kitchen get some water anything like that don't have to worry about bringing that specific device with you so your headphones stay connected now when it comes to touch controls on these headphones pretty simple the right one if you just tap it once you'll see on my phone it will start to increase the volume and the left headphone will decrease the volume so pretty simple just left right you got a nose up and down same easy concept for going to the next track or the previous track just press and hold for two seconds let go and it'll go ahead and skip the song and finally the last one is only for the right earbud just go ahead and double tap and it will go ahead and pause the song and if you do it again it will start to play again overall the touch controls were very easy to get used to just placing your finger the right spot it has a good amount of surface area to find where you actually need to touch overall the only gripe I have which isn't really that big of a deal is that you can only play pause with the right one so maybe I'm holding something in my right hand I kinda have to transfer over to my left hand so I can double tap the player pause not that big of a deal just kind of wish you could do that on both of them worth mentioning these touch controls can manage your calls as well and speaking of phone calls I've called a few different people and asked how does it sound what's the quality like and everyone is said good so has been no complaints with call quality with these headphones so that is everything I'm going to talk about for the Skullcandy indie headphones I will link to them down below keep in mind these aren't the only color options that you do have there are multiple ones and that's about it so hopefully you enjoyed the video be sure to click that thumbs up button drop a comment as well let me know you think about the indie headphones and as always guys thank you very much for watching

10:22:45.649183, well hey there welcome you know you seem like the kind of person who appreciates great sound so naturally you demand a lot from your headphones you want the best right well you have come to the right place hey there I'm Caleb Denison for digital trends and that cheesy intro was brought to you by coffee coffee I've had way too much of it okay enough of that nonsense let's get down to the business of laying out the best headphones you can buy in 2020 so far this list will change later this year and we'll have to shoot another video but for now these are all really solid picks we test tons of headphones every year many of us are musicians some of us musicians who travel a lot some musicians who exercise a lot I'm definitely not one of those people some of us have kids some of us game and wouldn't you know it there's a headphone out there for just about every need so before we get to the very best headphones you can buy let's look at the best in a series of categories and we start with the best ear buds you can buy under a hundred bucks that honor goes to the one more triple driver ear buds these things have no business sounding so refined at this price point in fact they redefine what you should expect from any headphone under $100 the name refers to the fact that there are three individual transducers in each bud and they've been expertly tuned to sound like a 3 or $400 pair of headphones they're comfortable compact there's an inline mic included and at 80 bucks they are a no-brainer get them next let's talk about the best true wireless earbuds and our choice might surprise you right now we're going with the Amazon echo buds yes I know there are far better sounding true wireless earbuds and if you want to spend a lot more go for it but we like these because they are true Wireless buds that everybody can get behind and most can afford at just 130 bucks you get solid sound quality Bose noise reduction good call quality and well average battery life at about 5 hours with another 15 hours of charging coming from the case for the price you can't beat this feature set now a close second in my opinion is the Samsung Galaxy buds plus within insane 11 hours of playtime for charge and decent sound in a very compact but they don't sound as good as Amazon spuds but they get the job done and they're also only a hundred and fifty bucks next up are the Apple earpods Pro which are the best buds for iPhone users but honestly if you have the money and can wait to get a parent since they are chronically out of stock do it because and I still can't believe I'm saying this about an Apple earbud these things are awesome the active noise-cancelling is best in its class they are pretty comfortable battery life is about average and the sound quality is more than acceptable I actually like it just fine audiophile grade no that's for the next set of buds but overall these are some of the highest performing pair of true Wireless buds you can get right now and for most folks they take all the right boxes if you are serious about sound I mean you want the best sound you can get from a pair of wireless buds with decent battery life and really solid noise cancelling then you want to look at the sony WF 1000 xm3 these are luxurious and like I said the sound quality is fantastic so if that's your number one requirement buy with confidence oh and you'll need about 200 bucks for the pleasure that's a lot of buds but how about some full-size cans well for music lovers we're all about the Sennheiser HD 650 which you can also get from mass drop as the HD 6x X for $200 these things sound amazing it's everything you expect from Sennheiser in the sound quality department for a shockingly low price they are open backed headphones so not the best pick for office use people will hear what you're listening to but the open back design allows for extremely Airy transparent and open sound with solid base and a mid-range that is so pure you'll feel like you're hearing your favorite singers for the first time got kids get them these I got these for my kids and they love them these are the Pierrot sound labs Pierrot quiet cans and they will not only protect your kids ears but they shut out the outside world with active noise-cancelling all in a kid sized wireless headphones they come in three colors they sound great and they're a hundred bucks I mean what more do you need now for the best of the best this may come as no surprise as they top a lot of headphone lists they are of course the Sony WH 1000 xm3 right now you can get them for about $300 and the best endorsement I can give them are that they are my personal favorite I take these everywhere I fly a lot the noise canceling is outstanding the sound quality is fantastic the battery life is excellent there's almost nothing I don't like about these I will say that the one thing that tends to disappoint people is that they only connect to one device at a time also this pigtail charging cable is virtually useless these are the two things I want so need to address with the next version of these headphones which will come out later this year even when the next version does come out though I'm still going to be suggesting these because the price will go down while supplies last making them an even better slam-dunk I will say that if you're a hardcore business type who takes a lot of phone calls with your headphones you might want to check out the Bose ANC 700 they are super comfy they sound great have excellent noise cancelling but most importantly they do phone calls really well the Sony's just aren't that great attack couple of honorable mentions for work out headphones check out that jlabbe epic air sport or the Jabra elite active 75t both are excellent waterproof solid fitting options with lots of fitness perks built-in also for you gamers out there we are big fans of the Astro 850 which sound incredible have an excellent mic and are comfortable enough to wear all day which you probably will that's our list folks what do you think leave a comment down below about your favorite headphones like subscribe bring that notification bell

iGyaan,2020-10-07 10:22:45.649251, hey guys what's up this is Bharath you're watching I again and today it's time for another top tech video today we're checking out the top wireless headphones that you can get for under 2500 let's get started as always guys if you like top tech videos and if you like these specific top tech videos don't forget to hit that like button and the subscribe button if you're not already a part of tema again now we've already done a wireless headphones video which includes a few of our favorite wireless headphones under this price bracket so I'll leave a link to that video so some of the headphones that you may not see here will be available in that video all the links to everything featured in this video will also be in the description below so you can go ahead and quickly buy these products let's start off with the first pair of headphones first about the Jack Martin h1 1:1 Bluetooth wireless headphones these are pretty impressive looking headphones we've got them in the black and red color they're priced at eighteen hundred and ninety nine and they are also the cheapest headphones on our list before we get into the audio quality you will see that the build quality of the headphones is pretty nice it's got padding all over it's got soft comfortable foam pads on the ear cups as well as comfortable foam padding and wrapped padding on the headband it also has a metal headband which is quite flexible and overall the headphones are extremely lightweight as well they have a 250 ml amp hour battery which delivers up to 10 hours of music playback another interesting feature of this is that it does have inbuilt LED lights which is absolutely fantastic so just the single click of a button will enable the LED lights on the side of the headphones which will make them look funky if that is something that you're into now they do have bluetooth 4.2 they are extremely lightweight and as far as the audio quality is concerned they are pretty impressive in terms of the bass and overall sound quality is pretty impressive considering the price tag if you are looking for something that gives you a good quality lower end of the audio spectrum these headphones are definitely the ones they do come with an included 3.5 mm cable for those who are interested in using the analog side of things and you can also charge the headphones using a standard micro USB port so all-in-all pretty impressive and especially the light feature is something that a lot of people would be interested in go check these out next up on our list are the brokest urban bluetooth headphones these cost nineteen double nine and previously we wanted to feature them in our previous video but at that time they were priced much higher at 2999 but now they're available for 1999 which makes them pretty impressive for the price that they're available at now or these are the only headphones that come with an extra set of washable pads so if your earphones or ear cups get dirty you can simply throw them into the washing machine while you use the secondary pair that is included inside the box these are easy to swap out the ear cups as well so if you do damage one set you always have an additional set these headphones allow for two devices to be connected at the same time so you could switch between a Bluetooth enabled television and a smartphone quite easily if that is something that you're looking for the headphones are quite well built they're extremely lightweight and durable they do have a rubber headband padding along with soft foam cups like I mentioned they are swappable they will last about eight to ten hours in terms of the battery life along with 10 meters of distance pretty impressive you do have an inbuilt microphone a 3.5 mm headphone jack play pause buttons and volume controls directly on the headphones as well the overall sound quality is wide and you can get a good soundstage on these headphones they are not bass heavy they're more known for clarity so if you are looking for clarity in your headphones these ones will definitely be a good option next up on our list for a price of 2499 are the invent saver 630 these are the only over-the-ear headphones in our list and might I say they are rather comfortable the headphones have a really soft comfortable protein ear cushion on the ear cups and the headband is flexible and adjustable so you can get big heads into these headphones without any problems since the design is over the ear it'll sit comfortably around your ear and not pressing down too hard making them rather comfortable for long periods of time the headphones come with a 320 milliamp hour battery and it can be fully charged in about two hours lasting for up to 13 hours as far as battery life is concerned these are also the only headphones in our list that do come with a included carry case a hard good protection carry case is also included which makes it a plus for these headphones also the auxiliary port is still on these so if you are not interested in using them wirelessly you can also use them in a wired fashion these headphones also support two devices at the same time and of course a2dp as well as far as the soundstage is concerned again it's extremely wide not very bass heavy but if we tweak around with the equalizer a little bit you can improve the bass if that is something that you're looking for the standard sound stage is pretty good and good amounts of clarity good amounts of sound now finally in our list are the JBL T 450 Bluetooth headphones now these cost two thousand four hundred and ninety nine and they're actually on sale there originally for upwards of three thousand bees so in fact if you go and look for the blue color today they still cost more than three thousand rupees now these are the only headphones that do not have a 3.5 mm headphone jack so if that's something that you're looking for these headphones do not have it the build quality is also pretty plastic based because the headband does not have any kind of padding the ear cups however are the softest in the list of the headphones that we have over here and the ear cups are nice and bendy so you they make it easy for you to flatten them out and travel with them they do have 32 mm dynamic drivers and to get a really good quality sound along with really good quality lower-end on these headphones the best sounding audio along with the best sounding bass are can be had from these headphones again you do have controls directly on the ear cups as well as an inbuilt microphone and a micro USB port for charging these out of the for headphones featured here the JBL headphones are the most flexible can be folded flat completely and also offer up the maximum amount of pace it is also worth noting that both the brokest urban as well as the Jack Martin headphones are not bendable so you cannot hold the ear cups at all and they have a fixed ear cup design you can extend the headband but that's about it they will not fold flat and the JBL headphones in our list are the only headphones that will completely fall flat the invent Sabre will also fold flat that's how they fit inside the case so that's it for this video guys if you have any questions or queries to drop them in the comment section below if you like the products from this video they are all

Review|Bose Soundsport Free Review|Jaybird Earphones|Jaybird Tarah Review|Jaybird Tarah Pro Review,2020-10-07 10:22:45.649440, [Music] hey what's going on people all right j-bird run XTS there's some things that they kept in some things they mildly changed are the improvements worth upgrading and how does it compete with the competition as always being transparent with my lovely audience here what is up team James Revere was fired modi's for you guys j-bird did send this over for a review but my assessment was not altered in any way I'll be going over both pros and cons the last this is priced at 179 dollars retail but I place my affiliate links that in that video description below click on those links for the most updated prices in real time you never know when these things might go on sale I'm Jimmy with Jim's review and I'm here to help you make that purchase decision welcome everyone the video [Applause] [Music] alright folks let's go over the physical features first and see what those subtle changes are first we receive a slightly redesigned ear fin they're much more curved or angled than before and when I tested the original runs I was clear and transparent with you guys and admitted they kept falling out of my ear during my jogging sessions most likely my ears are a little bit weird but when I compared them to all the other competitors I reviewed so far on this channel I've never had that issue and sorry about the cringy faces in the video here but this time around they stay in perfectly fine and they do give me confidence that they won't fall out and I know I look a little bit weird in the video right here but after testing these shaking them vigorously they stay in not to mention they look really damn good black and black is killing it now getting a closer look for those who are unfamiliar with the j-bird runs there are physical buttons for pairing turning them on and off and such they're all very responsive and very clicky now each press is light enough so when you have these in your ear you're not actually like jamming these earphones into your head here again very subtle clicks awesome now most of the functionality from the button presses are all there although I do appreciate having Google assistant in the left ear bud or Siri that is at my fingertips but what we don't have or all the features available at the same time here let me reach into my pants in them so within the app you have to choose in the settings other default controls or alternative controls as you guys can see here now if I choose default controls you get Google assistance or Siri which is awesome but you only have pause and play you can't use that left earbud that is over here to adjust your volume down now same thing with your right ear but I can pause and play but then I can't adjust the volume up I have to switch over to alternative controls and I know what your blood is off right there but what's up alternative controls it's basically vice-versa I'll lose the Google assistance or Siri and then it lose the pause and play feature unfortunately you have to pick and choose now this was a nuisance to me the less times honestly that I have to take up my phone that is the better during a workout especially during a run or simply having the convenience of just sitting at my desk right here and then if I need to adjust volume again don't want to whip out my phone you have to again pick and choose I wish a bird found a different way to do this now since I'm still on the buttons here the only other feature that I found missing Jabra calls it here through Sennheiser themselves calls it transparency mode they're run XTS basically doesn't include a feature like those other competitors they don't include a function that allows the outside environment the noses around you to be pumped in through the microphones for safety or simply awareness so with the run XTS these are 100% passive noise isolation earphones which I do love though and these do blackout a lot of noise these barely sound leaked as well but having the option for runners to hear their environment raw listening to music would have been nice now I don't know if you the consumer actually value this but comment down below let me know let all of us know if I'm just being picky here but this is something runners actually use I personally think I personally use it again for safety reasons let me know if this is a feature that you guys desire yourself now the workaround and actually a plus for most people you have the ability to leave only one of these earphones in your ear if you'd like with other ear phones such as again the Sennheiser Momentum's true Wireless which I reviewed earlier this week you can only leave the right earphone in if you choose to leave only the left one in like I do with the Jaybirds here and the right earphone goes into your pocket or so it's not going to work with the j-bird run XTS you don't have that problem I can't I can confirm that you can either switch either/or and put the other one in your pocket and you still have a year to listen out you know for what's going on around you now moving on the second change that makes the XTS better than the previous generation but more importantly better than most of the competitors is its ipx7 rating while most competitors have an ingress rating of around 4 or 5 many that they're only splash-proof or maybe at most spray proof the xt can be fully submerged in water up to one meter for up to 30 minutes now I wouldn't recommend swimming with these but these are now as rugged as the draw bras which also have an IP 7 rating as you see in the video I had this in water as well and they're still functioning fine today now it would be cool though if these could float in water too but again for most people who are running along the street or so baby bike the woods you're probably not gonna drop this into the lake now getting into better life it's still decent for hours and the earbuds themselves with another eight hours from the charging case so that's a total of 12 hours quick charge is available with only five minutes in the case and you can get up to an hour of playback back if that makes sense not pet at all now I did run my battery test at 50% in Vaughn to get in middle-of-the-road result and I achieved four hours and 53 minutes which was very similar to the first generation since I briefly mentioned the case here's a closer look they're not magnetized so once you put these earphones in here be careful because they could drop out now rotating to the back they still stuck a USB 2.0 connection for some reason we're heading into 2019 and in my humble opinion I think a lot of consumers should be investing to USB type-c since that's the next Universal ports most likely it is touching base on bluetooth performance now oddly we're still at also Bluetooth 4.1 although Bluetooth 5.0 has been out for a while and older technology but let's see what my testing showed with signal strength I'm able to achieve 82 linear feet of range with one wall in between and that's really good for an older Bluetooth technology testing this with video Android first I have a Samsung S A+ but I did have any video syncing issues with Netflix or YouTube that's a huge plus twitch on the other hand had horrible delays and I'm aware these are dedicated support earphones but my viewers do watch the video with sport earphones to a testing this for those with iPhones Netflix was slightly off youtube and twitch was horribly off sync I also never had issues with the right or left ear but cutting out and not playing as well the last feature I wanted to talk about before discussing audio is a phone call performance my voice is audible and at the forefront which is great news but like most other earphones they do pick up a good bit of environmental noises so getting into the audio performance I really love the chambered sound signature not because it's the most accurate if anything is the furthest from being accurate but it's loud it's in your face it's great for pop EDM hip-hop genres that I personally listen to you for those looking for balance or accuracy these are not really it's but if you're looking for more of an alive sound signature that's what the j-bert run X T's are for starting with bass these are surely bass boosted earphones it's fast thumping bass with some residents here it's not deep thunderous bass but more than plenty for the after mention generous I would caution though the mid-range is clear enough for most there is though an ever so slight amount of bass spilling over that prevents the mid-range from shining a bit further but we can address some of this in the app which I'll show you shortly after testing a good bit of truly wireless earphones over the years I do notice the Jaybirds not having an expansive or having a wide soundstage the run X days have excellent left and right audio separation but that spacial miss is not there it doesn't take away from the music but a wide soundstage always helps with the experience now the high frequencies are not screeching or over piercing but could use a bit more resolution or detail overall and to reiterate though the jaybird run XTS these pair of earphones are very colourful in a sense and many average consumers will really really enjoy them if I can give you an analogy let's say The Avengers movie infinity war or endgame nearly all the background is on a green screen but the visual artists tweets it to be visually appealing they put in all that filler and stuff in this case j-bert engineer's tweak the audio to what most average consumers like hopefully you guys understood that analogy there but let's get into the app here let me not whip it out but without the phone that is right on the dashboard you have several presets right on the home screen now hands down go to the equalizer this is where you can adjust all your settings it's very intuitive and very easy to use making an adjustment does not ruin the audio what I personally like is more for vocals more forward mids a little bit brighter right here so what I do is I just this up slightly to achieve my personal sound signature if you guys been farming for these years I like a slightly brighter sound signatures I should I usually leave it right around here I think there we go the j-bird app now on the base level I do enjoy the base I just leave it exactly where it is but right here is where it's at so next up here is the settings and define my bud option I love this feature not many competitors offer this but you're able to find your last location of where you last left your earphones now it's not 100% precise but it's a pretty good indication hopefully with it's showing where you are it will show you or it will remind you on where you last left the every button that you can go back to the area and look for them and like I said most other competitors don't even offer this so overall in my personal opinion if you only previous jaybird runs and you don't need the waterproofing I would say don't upgrade now for these XTS despite not being the most technologically advanced sport earphones for those who don't currently own the original runs or at least had trouble with the original runs had trouble with them staying in your ears I think the XTS are executing at a very very good level we're talk about battery life or tumble comfort and fit now and we're talking about the IP seven rating not only that but a sound signature now the negatives such as the button functionality or lack of button functionality the lack of transparency mode video playback is somewhat shot there you can say an USB 2.0 and the case it's one of those things where if you don't care for it or if you don't need it for video you don't care about the USB 2.0 and such the Jaybirds are still an excellent choice for the price the only other competitor that has an IP 7 rating that's a completely mainstream here is the Jabra elite sport that does come with some extra features all the button functionalities no USB type-c though if I recall but keep in mind those do retail for 219 dollars it's a little bit more expensive if you're in the 150 to 180 dollar price range the jaybird run XTS could be a very very good option for you I'd say definitely check it out at least definitely check out the audio signature that they provide all right folks like subscribe and fire mochi that comment session I'll catch you on the next one

Here are the Marshall Major III Bluetooth earphones. And, a big thanks to Marshall for sponsoring this video. Quick look at the box, we've got a picture of the Marshall Major IIIs, and then we've got the key feature here, 30-plus hours of wireless play time. That's absolutely insane. Now, I'm sure we've all been in that situation before, you're out and about, you forgot to charge your headphones, you don't have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack on your smartphone, so, you know, you can't use that, and your battery dies, and you're thinking what do I do now, completely useless. You're not going to have this issue with the Marshall Major III's 30-plus hours. That is absolutely insane. Now, we're just having a quick look here at the back of the box. We've got some of the key features. Bluetooth aptX connectivity, custom-tuned drivers, multidirectional control knob, phone functionality, collapsible design. These are all things we'll be looking at shortly. Let's go ahead and get this unboxed. All right, we're using the unboxing knife. Whoops, I think I just ruined my table. Anyway, get this other side, and we can just slide them out I think, yep. All right, a little lever here. Oh, hello. These look good. Right, so as well as the Major IIIs, inside the box you do have a user manual, you've got some safety information, you've got a USB type A to Micro USB cable, and that's what you're going to use to charge these. And, there's also a cable, a 3.5 millimeter cable, so if you do want to use these wired, you can do, and this is a pretty cool cable. Very nice, it's got this sort of stretchy bit in the middle as well. I'm not sure what you call it, but that's very cool. Right, now let's get straight to the Major III. As you can firstly see that they're actually collapsed, so they're going to be great for transport and things. We'll expand these. Got to say, they look very, very cool. We've got the Marshall logo here on both sides. Right, now let's go ahead and connect these up and see what they sound like. Bluetooth on. Major III Bluetooth, done. Nice and quick. Feel really good, and they do a really good job of blocking out the outside sound. Sound really good. Now, they've got 40 mm dynamic drivers that are custom-tuned for enhanced bass response, smooth mids, and crystal clear highs. And, I mentioned earlier on that these have Bluetooth aptX technology, and what that means is you're going to be able to play music at a higher bitrate, but, not only that, it also minimizes audio and video syncing issues. Now, you'll notice here that we've got this multidirectional control knob, and this is going to allow you to do all of your controls for your music and your phone calls. If you push and hold then you're going to be able to switch it on and off. If you just push once, then it's going to play and pause. You can skip forward by pushing to the right, skip backwards by pushing to the left. Push to the right and hold to fast forward. Push to the left and hold for rewind. Push upwards to turn up the volume. Push downwards to turn down the volume. And, you've also got the phone functionality so you're going to be able to answer and reject calls straight from here. By pressing once you can answer or end a call, or you can press twice to reject an incoming call, too. Now, they've got these 3D hinges here so you can rotate to make sure you have the best fit. And, the cushions are super soft so they should be very comfortable for long listening periods. Now, one really cool thing about the Major IIIs is that they have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack, and this is not only going to allow you to connect these on wired so if the battery does eventually run out you're still going to have that option, but also to share your music. So, what you can do is, say, for example, you've got a friend and you're both watching the same thing on an iPad, for example, and you want to be listening to the same thing, you could be connected on wirelessly, and they're going to be able to connect onto these using the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and listen to exactly what you're listening to, and that's really pretty cool. So, there we have it, guys, the Marshall Major III Bluetooth headphones. Some really dope headphones, and if you want to pick some of these up, then I'm going to be leaving a link in the description below. They are available worldwide. What do you guys think of these? Definitely drop me a comment below and let me know. I hope you enjoyed this video and find it useful. If you did, then do hit that thumbs-up button for me, it really does it help me out.

This is Saf on SuperSaf TV. I'll see you next time. All right, let's start listening."

10:22:45.649506, Greta's I rob chapels and I'm the captain this is the wonderful Matt anoint is my look can I so knew colleague here we need a name for this colleague we do that I mean it's three do three do yeah we got a colleague here because Matt is here to show us an exciting new product from boss which might be tricky to to demo so I think it's gonna be tricky to do what is it that's all I think we're gonna have to judge on some reactions okay a reaction video we also need to say neither of us have seen these all tried them we have literally no concept of what this is so I just hope they they work and you enjoy them basically yeah right so what we've got is this pair of is which might give it away I guess the first wireless personal amplification system is what we're calling it and how far up does it need to go before you personal amplification system okay so what we have is the boss air oh I like the vintage styling so I thought about me like Sony Walkman spongey you know stuff that looks great Oh feel that I mean faux leather presumably but they they're nice oh man they've actually made some nice so heading phones yeah I've gotta say they've you have absolutely the visual on those headphones yes so these are a completely wireless guitar amp system right in a pair of headphones for your up for only for use yes so if you imagine you know you can't I mean I live in a small flat in London or you've got family or kids and you can't play out loud this is designed to kind of allow you to actually have an enjoyable experience playing guitar to be first cheaper than to find a place with the studio attached to this so you don't have your you don't plug your guitar amp it is no they literally are the amp in the iPhone exactly but what makes them really unique is that obviously when you plug a pair of headphones into a PC or a phone if you're using an app but it kind of sounds pretty Undine ammok it's pretty flat yes right a pretty decent sound but it's not the same as playing and in a room so one thing you want is to feel that the air coming out you almost want to feel like you're in a space okay right great fan that's what this does so these actually have something that we've built in called Jarrah ambience using a sensor here and means fire it's part of music is this gonna be like a black mirror moment when I put them on and then suddenly I'm lost for the for eternity needless to say that headphone amps are not a new thing no but what this does is it actually places the amp in a virtual space so it moves it away from just the ears and then you can position that what in any way that you want some virtual reality amplifier I guess you could call it that in some way I mean I'm intrigued because it and this is quite pertinent for me and guys who follow me or people who follow me on on my facebook and instead pages will know that it's the pages insta pages will know that I had a helix Anna Kemper that I took home for a few nights each and just because the headphone experience was so unrealistic is that the right word because it's it's literally like you don't really appreciate until you put headphones on that what you're actually hearing with the guitar amplifier when you put it in a room is this massive sound created this by yeah and when you put headphones on it's literally like sticking your head in between two speaker cabs and it's just very unrealistic yeah so I ditched all that and went often used a little Yamaha THR amplifier instead I know I should have used a guitar around but I saw I'm kind of intrigued to know whether or not this solves that unrealistic Iberian absolutely excited - yes so what obviously they're pretty noise cancelling as well so when I'm talking to you you probably not gonna be over here long so what I'll do is have a little bit of a play - and I'll show you that no wireless and it's wireless as well so you can dock the house this house this running in just normal batteries or runs on lithium-ion batteries that you can recharge so right in charge you get around five hours on the headphones so I can fly to America so ably shredding they start on the plane in first class 1100 so that's crazy okay I'm hoping we're gonna have you in genuine first reaction just turn on for me make sure they get the sound that I call it off set a pretty clean sound aw come on man yeah and then you can adjust it on the app so that's your volume control for your guitar right so you can roll up the volume here yeah these are for changing patches up and down slightly feel like an old person learning about something new don't touch the buttons yet okay and don't touch this but if you weren't only going on - things don't touch things yet all right okay now so we just set up a pretty clean your own your screen recording your I'm screen recording this is where is the up beat is there a head-up display not yet not yet right so it's just your clean sound yeah right so if you want to change the crunch we leave sound Wow right okay so yeah give them a lead sound yes a lead sound gain volume and then you've got all your effects on here as well so derive from the Gotama series boost modulation delay reverb happy sound yeah I couldn't like him hear it so they have this quite dislike yeah what so just take the headphones off for a sec okay so what when you play now what I'm going to do is I'm gonna put it in the first mode that's surround mode so now remove the amp into this space but I can physically move it around your head space oh well I like the stereo in my car where you can move it on yes so what you'll hear is the amp in front of you right and then I'm gonna move it by this is incredible so if people are watching this iPhone recording off means it's working like toasting noise but a normal pair of headphones right okay so I've put into surround made war [Music] so you're moving this I'm literally moving the guitar as what did you do moved it from in front of him to the head so see when you're playing at home you're playing with the guitar amp in front of you but when you actually want to play live or rehearsal you're playing with behind him so you can physically move that position between ears as well okay Wow but can you turn off the reverb so I saw here a room yes we can turn off the reverb on the amp sound here and then you can also turn off the ambience down as well for the ambience controls how big the room is alright that's outside now take them off leaving beep all right so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put it in the next mode that's static mode okay so what it's gonna do is it's gonna put the amp in front of you right but your head will fully control and it's this so you can see here on the guitar position and at least the opinion guarantee that these headphones are noise canceling so I can say anything I like about robot yeah I can see your lips moving and I can hear something that was about it I said yeah plate place the amp so it's in front so you can see now [Music] so you can see as it moves it's moved in the militant positions always in front and it's your head that's determining which direction you hear it [Music] it's so it's it is very effective in in tricking you to feeling like there's an amp physically there there's a tiny amount of lack of positional lag they eat that you can sense but if you're the sat it also sounds like it's higher than it would normally be like but I'm wondering if I yes I it's interesting because although it's in the same position you don't get the difference in the cone tone when you go higher mmm so it's like it's lightly amp is in front of my face yeah but that stays where it is those days put in a static so that's a physical control that you can change and you can again you can change the ambience so the more I turn up the ambience the bigger the space gets and then you can change that from a stage to a studio as well and that will change the kind of the feel for the room at work did you they're not gonna hear any of this but can I have a British crunch and like hardly any ambience yes so you can basically we can go crunch can you replicate playing on like a really so you can set how you want so it's just touchscreen so bass middle treble put all that mush Mitch what am i [Music] but you could effectively guard instruments how you dial in and who's gonna play stick bloody up that is just one to go that that's 93 92 you also get an actual amp so obviously the last thing is if you want to play you obviously want to play with a backing track command but when you play with a backing track you're always playing on top of the track you're never playing with the track right so what if we could place the band in a virtual space alongside the guitar playing everything is behind you like you're playing on the stage am I in a virtual space as well so you'll also be in the virtual space so have you got a virtual wedge monitor that Rob could put its foot on like that yes yeah so if I load up the old Anton's bar yes let's put the headphones on here this is a world first people we have this binaural microphone set which kind of hoping will replicate a set of human ears but if I'm totally honest with you we've never done this before so who knows the headphones are now positioned over the years this part of the demo will only really work if you're wearing headphones as well okay I'm just getting our iPhone just hold it I think as well like oh you know push for this we saw in Bob's reaction it's like the hearing of them is really bling because when it's in that headspace fire it's so unbelievably crazy yeah and I'm holding the stand because what I'm gonna try and do is twist it like this so that you can't really affect but there is a tiny bit of handling noise like because I'm you know if you'll just have to try and do and keep the handling noise to a minimum but obviously you won't get that when you're wearing these on your head so let's go there so why don't I play the track first and I'll show you a bit of the ambience level but and also just the lovely audience know that we're hearing it's true speakers in the room yeah so if you're wondering how I know what to play yes because of that yeah so let's start the track [Music] my dog [Music] [Applause] [Music] I think that might be enough as as I said or as we all say we have absolutely no idea whether this style of demonstration has helped you appreciate what this is doing on you you guys are now gone okay I'm gonna show you a couple other bits with the headphones real quick if that's all right let's put the yeah yeah I don't know what to do we can't you can mute though I know they're kind of your speaker's still a little okay so basically kind of same thing that you saw Rob doing at the beginning let's start I'll start with it off and then we'll dial in your amp sound okay and it will turn it on yeah speaking freely adjust it however you want yeah okay I mean it's still got that sense it's a do you know what it's not it doesn't feel quite as in your ear as it did when I was using helix with no more headphones but it's still it's still oh so now ready [Music] [Laughter] [Music] so now it's directly in front of him apart from literally apart from I don't know how long I particularly want to wear headphones you know like is that that enclosed sense and the heat that builds up in your ear tonally it is utterly different to wearing headphones normally yeah so a big thing is is that drivers are custom designs and the ear pads are custom design so it's really built to not only give you a good audio experience like Bluetooth audio but also a good guitar playing it's a katana on your head isn't it it's a virtual critic you know what's interesting is without the surround technology is face without the surround technology when you first hear it it's like this is like the best version of other headphones that we ever heard and then when it's placed in the space it's a whole new world yeah Celeste's okay so this is the static mode so the answer weighs in front of you okay so the amps here I think the amps there yeah I've got way more in this here ah say it's always gonna be in the front so you need to face dead-on you'll see that oh I see stay on Thomas it's a bit more it's slightly unrealistic in the sense that it's almost like you're outside and it's like so there's the amp and as soon as you go like they're like if you're in a real room I don't think you'd hear that much difference but in the headphones as soon as you go there it's like it's going it we can turn down that by our gaze as well and we can change the space as well that's better that's cool all right I guess so much better okay okay I'm gonna play you the backing track okay all right put the band behind them okay we'll go a minor this one all right the most interesting demo ever wins it's so satisfying ours is the experience of Joe stage yes so you can change that for ambience that stage size so if I turn it up to max yeah don't plan anything just listen to Kate right listen for the drums in the background and then if I turn it down and now I'm going to turn it off you know what's weird actually if you were to when you're listening to a backing track so you're listening to you know your music on your phone I can record it album off that that actually is what you would normally hit exactly off like with a backing track context doesn't sound worse it sounds like how you would expect it yeah it's only really the guitar that sounds bad with it off if you could use these as headphones yeah you can stream Bluetooth audio to them and actually just bleed transport controls on there as well which and I think I carry start/stop yes so I'll see if I can demonstrate them at off so I can talk say if we're on Spotify you can pick the button in and it will play the track evils and for the track oh yeah but say if you want to go back so you you you missed a bit in the track and you want to rewind the track you can you've got like a rewind yeah we say I'll show you boots a leg so if I hold the button forward and tip them forward you can see it fall sports the track oh no way oh I see not yeah things just by tipping the headphones so what if you head bang with these two it came as if I'm not watching you in a room just came like this so yeah you can rewind fast-forward play and pause all from the headphones by dude but can you turn that off cuz like you really get into this track I'll be going it only works when you press testify no dick Ulis so then on top of that you can obviously use the editor if I just go back to it here yeah so there's actually a librarian so you can save all your own sounds in and then scroll through with the two buttons so if you can have up to six sound saved into the headphones and scroll through them and that can have any level ambience or you've already watts is it I don't know if he's actually i feel like can i get a projection out and unplug it just to be utterly clear again there's no line input on well you said this but how are you so that the the wireless receiver is built-in so don't fall this is just for pairing the transmitters right ok so yeah there's no sense that you can put a jack cable in here no there's no line out or anything it's totally just a totally personal so but when you buy the headphones do you get the one you get the was if you had a anything really Oh guitar amplifier or a or a Kemper or whatever and you plugged this some form of line out and then into there would did although we haven't tried it there's nothing to stop you feeling nerve at the end of your pedal blood sure should we just let me see unsavable because i just want to know yeah okay sure that's so that's exciting box thinking let's hack this I was even thinking again it's but it was more let's say I had an alternative let's add a GT 1000 or something like that and I just wanted to apply plug it into the clean truck only Alcinous no there's always you can't turn the amp modeling off right but there is a flat mode for bass or acoustic so if you want to use it we actually tried it with a modular synth so we plugged it into the output of a synthesizer and then it did the same thing and you can turn around or if you want to do keyboards or a piano as well yeah it works totally presumably you always have that slight problem with this you'll always need the wires in there no but then this switches itself off a bit doesn't stops moving yeah so you've always got you can okay I think you get around 60 minutes oh really yeah before I've plugged my pedal board in I've obviously used a cable to plug into my pedal board but I could conceivably buy a second wireless system if I wanted to and then right at the end where the cable would normally come out and go into the amp is the transmitter for the headphones so let's have everything off soft and the ambience off I've set the answer flat so it's just a queen out of string there with a bit reverb maybe here it can add a bit of reverb [Music] please hacked it if I can I can still then turn on the static mode turn down the ambience of the room oh man it's literally the same as playing into an amp I'm desperate to hear so so get a clean sound I've got a clean sir are you ready I'm ready Clem soul coming in holy bear delay from the pedalboard oh it's not on bit delay [Music] and I've seen the static mode so you can make your head yeah that's a tremendous amount of of being able to hack the system and make any more moves I've got to say you know totally so I'm gonna lose my link this is like my first reaction total honest everything first and foremost I think they're beautifully made and they fit they do feel really comfy to wear and that that's always been my you know uncomfortable headphones are a terrible thing on themselves as in its flat mode for a backing track it just sounds like a great pair of headphones I I love as soon as you put it into any of the surrounding nodes I love the way that it gives you the sense that you are in the room I'm not massively as you move your head around all I'm really hearing is it's changing the the accent on the volume to the left or the right ear it doesn't necessarily feel utterly natural you know you I can see what's sort of happening so I'm not sure how much I would use that but but I would a million percent just leave this in the I love the idea of the fan being behind you and just playing I think that's the wick is a backing track thing for me is the real killer part of it because so often about you're playing on top of the track you're not playing with a track and it really allows you to sit in the mix I think you've described that perfectly mud because it made me feel like I was playing better because I felt like I was in a band yeah the experience of being in a band is well that delivers yeah and you know if you really want to turn around you in a solo wherever or get your laptop up and have a Wembley Stadium and play in front of a stadium you can really get that feel that you're playing in front of an audience is that just volume is it so yeah you've got guitar volume up and down for your patches and shares on the pads sort of the pads and then yeah the pads are also magnetic as well what do you mean just so if you oh I see the cleaning company you can just take them off oh yeah so no driver built into that as well so games are a big driver isn't it yes really designed for that balance of guitar playing and you know instrument and audio at the same time because if you're playing to an mp3 normally and you are just listening through a pair of audio headphones yeah and this is something totally different experience is there any way of getting the sound from these headphones out of the headphones only if you use something like we tested today now I see what on here but I think the thing is they're great for you know playing at home or even though backstage or tour bus yeah you know rather than having you know you maybe just can't have it you know something like a honorary blasting out a little bit sound you need it to be polite you can totally hear a million applications yeah is that they're really really good you've got to try them Pete do you want to have a little yeah can we play Peter Honora is now going to demonstrate for you the beautiful sounds are these boss headphones I hope you enjoyed them so you're gonna hear it totally clean all right so darling your amp sound and then I'll turn I'll turn it on okay all right [Music] right there's such a pleasing experience the son who said to watching someone else has reacted like this thick stick one a piece back in tracks I dig it big time so now you can move your head come on man so let's let's go for the let's go for the backing track then we'll go for the merry one so now it's normal headphones here nope so now I put them in the band here so the bands behind you [Laughter] so I can turn up the ambience level can you can you is there a bit in the app where you can get the crowd to clap it's weird man it's giving flashbacks of being on stage big fans it's what it is [Music] and then yeah move it to the studio for the ambience back a bit so yeah I'm just there now oh this way [Laughter] [Music] there's over there yam sounds like it's over there everything seems like it's there yeah so what you can do that you love how when anyone's got headphones on this time so you can actually reposition the amp they coded buttons on the side of the headphones you click and both in at the same time it'll actually position the amp back behind you there you go so you can pick your front also when you're doing that's a crazy oh it behind you is wherever you're facing as you press it exactly yeah have we mentioned in this video you know how much you think they're going to cost the RRP price is four to nine euros euros so probably under 400 pounds yo case or not ya know it's cheap headphones are they but they're actually as far as headphones go not expensive either no and I mean the fact that you can listen to audio they're totally wireless and I mean there is no one that is doing anything similar and the fact that everything's built into the headphones is not the app that's doing it is to headphones that they're doing all the processing he's gone he's loving noise I'm gonna turn it off how much is katana air that's about 300 isn't it I think roughly RP price is about the same Wow so potentially because that's been massively popular all those thr amps have been massively popular so relatively speaking it's the same though just a choice now as to whether or not you want to go show is it cool and the thing is you can fold it down you can put me to kick bag I'm gonna go I'm gonna put it back in this in this in on the stage or a maximum ambience you can share my lapel mic a more appropriate thing to do I think yeah oh please I hope these worked well for you guys when you were listening but I suspect the only way you can really do this is to try a pair yourself or you know take our word for it it's pretty cool it's the best best headphone experience I've ever had 100% and I was I was totally - saying the first time I had someone walk me through them mm-hmm I just got lost for like 20 minutes yeah flying - backing tracks going doesn't never put towns I'm the only painter back I guess you're gonna need the app so to build to try them yeah you can actually use it without the app because everything's done in the headphone so there is some sounds already in the headphone so if you come into the store you can solicit the apps free apps free and yet you can tell us Android and iOS yep there will be an Android version as well you'll get a pair that's great man I've got to be honest with you I got all day long Sam sticky talk sounds are you taking these away with you yeah I need to throw them away okay well I'm gonna buy a pair and just see cuz I think in the room for you for whatever you guys go was it sound like in the room and we try and concoct this idea of it some mics over here and up here and stuff it never wears I'm thinking if that's just there and that's what that's what I'm hearing is that my head head make sure you John Mayer's face absolutely John Mayer's lips when is and seriously man you need to team up with a virtual reality company as well because can you imagine the immersive experience have been why don't we get a pair you'll say your get the chairs and captain guys just probably little audience out there's like a slightly longer print if somebody who works for a VR company is watching this a hundred percent do something that works they can you imagine being able to download backing tracks where you turn round and there is like your favorite band playing behind you and you're the guitar I think you know you'd win I think know how you getting home that's just how you get lost in them well then we are there we go oh great that was a long video apologies but this is great there you go I know stock in time for Christmas sorry it was a bouncer like a round of applause thanks right yes so literally in stock links below to go around attorneys tappy tappy credit card information and start having your fun on these headphones literally tomorrow put them on and ignore everything right I mean the cat didn't was up in that danis [Music] [Applause] [Music]

Wireless Momentum review,2020-10-07 10:22:45.649578," hey everyone whoever told me about these thank you very much because these are stupid cheap and from a respectable company Skullcandy now I decided not to be so cheap and purchased this one myself as always I'll be going over both pros and cons and if you want the most updated prices in real time I'll place my a fill links down in that video description click on that and you'll see if there's any sale prices going on at the moment I'm Jimmy with Jim's review and I'm here to help you guys make that purchase decision welcome everyone to another video look good and feel good - its smooth plastic construction like most other competitors and the touch button is layered with what feels to be a textured silicone covering over time people see if this part holds up now the Skullcandy sash is IP 5 rated meaning they are sweat water and dust resistant this can take up to low water jet sprays and with my testing putting some water all over these things the earphones are still fine 10 fees for looks comfort and stability I honestly thought these session would have been a bit more lower profile these are still good though as they don't stick out past my tears when looking straight down at you guys but looking closer there is a slight gap though from the side though it looks perfectly fine comfort wise these have been great for in-ear earphones they are also super light and airy feeling and I will admit I would have preferred a bit more stability since the only thing that's really keeping the sessions in the ear here is the ear tip themselves if you look closely you can see the bottom of these Skullcandy Seche is simply resting on the bottom of my ear but with that being said testing these in the gem testing these while running in of course the reasonable test right here these do these do stay in and I have had them fall out I do push the right ear but in from time to time to make a snug again once in a while but that could easily just be my ears as it the physical buttons I'll list all the actions on the screen for you guys the one thing that won't be a nuisance though for you at home is the double tap to increase or decrease volume doing a double press bumps it up once and if you need BOM to go up even higher you gotta tap it again you can't hold it down it's just that intuitive now one feature of missing is audio pass-through I believe every pair of sport earphones needs to have this feature for situational awareness but you don't get that feature here where the microphones turn on and they pump and your environmental for again safety and awareness there's just times you just don't need that passive noise isolation you don't get that here now turn by time testing I can confirm you can take off the left earbud and still have music play it's the same with your right side if you only want one earbud in the ear now since we're talking about connections the Skullcandy set constant bluetooth 5.0 I was worried since the cheap down and the microUSB here for their charging case but I'll get into that a little bit later now bluetooth 5.0 is the latest and greatest with my testing I'm able to reach up to 95% of my 1,100 square foot apartment here having this signal go through several walls and that's really good testing this with video YouTube played perfectly fine Netflix nope very odd since this does have bluetooth 5.0 possibly there's a quarter second delay it's minut but it is there if you do scrutinize now get him back to that charging case again microUSB is used instead of use PC which is somewhat of a letdown but again this is a definitely a bunch of pair of earphones hear better life is claimed to be only three hours of use per charge which is really love the average is usually between four to six hours of use at the moment the case can give you two full charges per skull Kandi's website giving you a total of 10 hours this is on the low end Spokane you also discloses there's no fast charging with these but I did confirm about an hour in the case here does bring the earphones from dead to a full battery alright let's get into the audio performance here's the microphone test and before doing so please be sure to visit here and follow my personal Instagram and Twitter those handles are on your screen follow my account there I place the links in the video description as well for your convenience all right folks here we go if you want to use this one here but definitely left that for you but it was jar walking along this road here and John is here these parts go by and seeing if if these were found suppresses the background and isolate my voice for those clear phone calls we'll see folks let me know down in the comment section below how this sounds hopefully it sounds good to you guys and we'll go back to the studio alright okay alright folks welcome back here let's get into the audio performance these things are crazy loud and there's no exaggeration for casual listening at 20 to 25% is good enough here with my phone at 30 to 35% volume it's equal to most of my other earphones I listen to at 70 to 75% vine when I watch Jim out the second thing you'll notice right off the bat here it doesn't matter if you're an audiophile or not these are freakin Basie as hell for those who are familiar with skull candy crushers that comes with a huge amount of resonance and deep bassy notes the sashes are very similar but the basic experience on these isn't as clean though the quality is very subjective here this is definitely I would say fall into either you love the category or you basically hate it if you like bass more so than refined audio where it has a less space here these might surely float your boat but those who prefer a bit more finesse the bass can be very overpowering somewhat causing the lower end of vocals to be slightly suppressed here and listening to these for a long period of time during my testing here does cause slight listening fatigue due to all that bass experience now the upper mid-range stood out enough for the upper end of vocals to be identified and appreciated the high frequencies themselves sounds to have some roll-off here or maybe that bass is just too overpowering that you don't really experience that crisp and reasonably sharp snare drum and cymbal Crash's at the very top now with more complex songs the audio identification does become slightly jumbled here it was my illustration of my fingers hearing say an instrument in the foreground and then another slightly off to the side and then here these singer performance well it can get a bit mixed now as you can see I try to be very fair and there's always a product that fits someone's needs some like domestic while some like foreign vehicles some dudes like fix some dudes know who knows but these indeed this wasn't for me these were hyper niche for the bass heads out there in the end if you love bass / refinement these are worth a consideration for the price but keep in mind I think most will find these a little too overpowering but again that's your call folks comment down below in the comment section here if you already purchased these let me know what you guys think if you guys have returned them who knows let us know so you can help others on this channel folks follow me on social media Jimmy local official NJ little official on Instagram and also Twitter respectively hope this video helped you in some way take care guys I'll see you guys [Music]"

description the products mentioned in this video are in no exact order so be sure to stay tuned until the end so you don't miss anything starting our list off we have the HyperX cloud flight our pick for a great value per dollar gaming headset not everyone is quite ready to spring 300 plus dollars for a pair of premium gaming headsets so if you are looking for a solid no-frills great value per dollar wireless headset the HyperX cloud flight available for under $100 might be more up your alley the HyperX cloud flight has a 2.4 gigahertz wireless connection with a range of up to 65 feet you get 90 degree rotating ear cups with the HyperX signature memory foam covered in a skin friendly soft breathable pliable leatherette that is designed for longer wearing there's also LED lighting effects and it's noise cancellation microphone is detachable the sound quality of the cloud flight is very good given its price you will be genuinely surprised at the level of punch that's delivered a headset at this price point is never going to rival a pair of luxury headphones like the SteelSeries arctas pro but the flight isn't as far off as you'd imagine it provides rich sound quality with crystal-clear low mid and high tones the enhanced bass reproduction gives a gaming experience unique to the cloud flight headset it features a 50 millimeter driver with neodymium magnets and it's closed cup design provides good isolation from the world around you this headset does not leak noise out of the ear cups either so if you are sneaking in some late night gaming action you will not wake up those around you when a huge stand out of the cloud flight is it's long battery life while most competitors lasts up to 15 hours on average this headset lasts up to an incredible thirty hours of gameplay so long gaming sessions will not be a problem the HyperX cloud flight may not be the newest or a feature-rich wireless gaming headset but it is a great bang for the buck it offers a good mix of high durability good battery life decent sound quality and remains nicely affordable the cloud flight offers quality above its price point and it'll be a trusty companion for a long time up next is the Logitech G 533 our pick for the best budget wireless gaming headset if you are on a budget and are looking for a wireless headset that will increase your gaming mobility yet still remain both attractive and affordable then the Logitech G 533 may be the one for you coming in at just under $70 this is one of the best budget wireless gaming headsets around the Logitech G 533 does an excellent job in striking the right balance between comfort features and performance the jet black matte plastic headband has a nice stealthy appearance and there's an ample layer of padding on the underside of the ear cups you'll appreciate that rather than using PU leather the g5 33 is covered by a durable soft mesh cloth material that helps to reduce heat and sweat both ear cups are well sized and have a square opening to fit over your ears at 350 grams it's lightweight and comfortable to wear even for long gaming sessions the wireless range works up to 15 meters and the battery lasts up to 15 hours with the included micro USB cable charging is quick and setup is easy straight out of the box simply connect the USB dongle to a free port on your PC and you are up and ready for action you can enable the DTS for 7.1 virtual surround sound through the Logitech software which adds an immersive level to your gaming however for music listening it does a respectable job but the base is a little underpowered the microphone does a pretty good job of vocal recording and is reasonably clear however the volume of the recordings could be better but a voice chat is all you're after then you'll have no complaints overall the Logitech G 533 is a versatile all-rounder that performs well sounds good in games is comfortable to wear and provides plenty of battery life and decent Wireless range you can't expect the g5 33 to sound like the cinema but it surely outperforms its entry-level price point next we have the SteelSeries arcgis 9x our pick for the best wireless gaming headset for xbox one not all gaming headsets perform the same when it comes to working with the Xbox one so if Xbox is your game system then the SteelSeries arcgis 9x is the headset for you at under $200 the arctic 9x is specially engineered to work wirelessly with the Xbox console and it provides a near-perfect connection combined with a rich audio experience and impressive battery life the arctas 9x boasts immersive sonic spatial audio which essentially means the audio performance is engineered to detect all of the noises happening around you regardless of how subtle or abrasive they might be the ArcGIS 9x is versatile and can be used both wirelessly and wired although a cable isn't supplied in the box it wirelessly connects to your Xbox one just like a controller and it's a breeze to set up one of the main features of the SteelSeries arcgis 9x is its dual connectivity options you can connect to a PC or console and also to another Bluetooth device simultaneously by utilizing the Xbox wireless connectivity and Bluetooth together at the same time for example you can listen to music off of your phone while at the same time hear your ingame audio the added convenience to be able to have dual connectivity is awesome because you can't get that with most other headsets the mic is clear comes with decent noise canceling and best of all is retractable for when you're not using it while you can never completely remove the mic it's it enough for you to use this headset as an everyday pair of cans connecting to phones and tablets via the Bluetooth connection that's a real bonus when compared to the similarly priced a 50 the SteelSeries arcgis 9 x is an awesome headset for Xbox one and wirelessly connects with the simplicity of a controller it's a great package for anyone serious about sound and wanting to get the most out of their Xbox games if you play games primarily on the Xbox one the arc dis 9x is the top choice however if you're looking for a headset for PC games then the SteelSeries arcgis pro coming up next might be a better choice for you if you're interested in updated pricing on any of the items mentioned in this video be sure to check out the links below prices update on these products almost daily with sales and general price drops so if you want to find the most updated information check the description if you find this video helpful please help out the channel by giving this video a like and tell us which product caught your eye in the comments below next up is the SteelSeries arcgis pro our choice for the best overall wireless gaming headset if you are willing to invest a little bit more for a premium top-of-the-line wireless gaming headset the SteelSeries arcgis pro looks stylish is comfortable to wear and delivers mind blowing sound worthy of audiophile worship this wireless headset is truly a gamer's dream and at under 330 dollars an investment in these babies is well worth it the SteelSeries arcgis pro is minimalist and has no fluff in it's classy matte and ergonomic design like the a 50 you'll love that the headband and magnetic ear cup covers can be replaced so you can personalize your prose and make them truly yours what's more changing the batteries won't slow you down there's a magnetic battery cover on the right side that lets you easily swap out Power Cells with one hand while keeping your other hand on the keyboard or controller the USB wireless transmitter features a clear OLED screen making it easy to navigate the UI plus the transmitter box also acts as a charger for your spare headset battery between the 10 hours of playtime you'll get from each battery and the fact that they take less than an hour to fully recharge you can basically keep playing with this gaming headset forever thanks to its 40,000 Hertz capable high fidelity speaker drivers you will be blown away by the amazing sound quality you get from this headset it is by far one of the best sounding wireless gaming headsets around arguably even better than many wired headsets although the SteelSeries arcgis pro is on the high end of the price spectrum and will set you back a pretty penny they are well worth the investment it does a bang-up job delivering on all fronts and is by far one of the best sounding gaming headsets money can buy you will not be sorry finally we have the Astro a-50 our choice for a great overall wireless gaming headset at just under $300 the Astro a 50 is a great choice if you are looking for a well crafted versatile and great sounding wireless headset that will deliver an immersive gaming surround sound experience not only will you love the Astro a 50s well weighted feel but you'll also love that this wireless gaming headset comes with a USB base station you get up to 15 hours of gameplay and the best part of all the extremely convenient magnetic docking design makes it very easy to keep your headset recharged you simply drop ba 50 into the base station when not in use and it will always be ready to go one perk in the design is that the headpiece can be swapped out along with the ear cups to tweak the styling to your choosing the microphone is very flexible and you can lock it in mute when it is pointing straight up so if you get interrupted during in-game chat you can instantly flip the mic to mute your conversation talk without having your private conversation accidentally broadcasted over the mic then flip it right back to continue your in-game chat very quick and seamless but on the downside you can't completely remove the microphone so it may be a bit annoying if you are using the headset to watch TV and also not very practical if you want to use this headset for music while on the go in terms of raw audio quality the a 50 is top-notch and the 40 millimeter drivers do a fantastic job of delivering even the smallest of sounds by enabling the Dolby headphone technology the surround sound wraps the game around your ears and immediately immerses you in the action like hearing the sound of footsteps creeping up behind you or the power of an explosive blast next to you the wireless range is about 30 feet and the signal is very good you won't lose connection even when you are in the next room although the Astro 850 headset is one of the pricier ones on our list it is very well rounded on all fronts for any gamer who wants a powerful versatile wireless gaming headset as well as a good headset for stereo surround sound in your living room a 50 delivers and is worth looking at alright guys that's all for now if you enjoyed this

headphones 2020|best noise canceling headphones|best wfh headphones|best headphones for working from home|athome|withme,2020-10-07 10:22:45.649728, [Music] when it comes to wireless headphones the over ear noise canceling models typically offer the most comprehensive set of features the best options combine stellar audio with powerful active noise cancellation or anc mix those elements with other handy tools to create as complete a package as possible of course some companies do this better than others after extensive testing and in-depth reviews we've compiled a list of the best wireless headphones you can buy right now [Music] top overall pick the sony wh-1000x m3 since their debut in 2018 sony's m3 have been our number one choice for noise-canceling headphones the company's 1000x line of over-ear models was already good but the third generation firmly planted sony ahead of bose the 1000x m3 is more comfortable than its predecessor thanks to soft ear pads a cushioned headband and reduced weight however the most notable upgrades are on the inside these headphones mark the debut of sony's powerful qn1 noise canceling processor the chip not only blocks out more external sound than the 1000xm2 but also relieves the dac of the anc duties that gives both components more room to work more effectively for that reason sony can offer 32-bit audio and ldap compatibility for high-res over bluetooth our only real gripe is with the frustrating touch controls but the core audio features remain the best your money can buy this model has some age on it at this point and should be due for an upgrade soon but until then the wh 1000x m3 remains number one in a close second we have the bose 700 bose hasn't been our top pick for a while but that doesn't mean the company isn't still making good audio gear last year it launched the bose 700 a new take on its noise cancelling headphones that has less of that data on a business trip vibe the company was clear that these aren't replacing the popular quiet comfort line but rather serve as an alternative bose nailed the anc and touch controls on the 700 however the company didn't include custom eq options or sound presets inside of its app because the treble can be harsh at times this was a little disappointing the 700 is 50 more than the 1000xm3 which is another reason bose wasn't able to retake the top spot in our rankings if you're looking to save some coin our best budget pick is the audio technica ath m50x bt audio technica's m50 headphones are a popular choice among djs and producers for their accurate response and comfy fit the company debuted a wireless version in 2018 that offers the same design without the need for a cord there's no anc here but there is sublime audio quality at headphones have great clarity and warmth to the tone which makes them a solid choice for a range of genres in fact these are actually my favorite headphones on this list in terms of audio quality despite the lack of active noise cancellation you still get a host of handy features like on-board controls and 40-hour battery life the m50x bt also has the 90-degree swiveling ear cups from its predecessors which allow the headphones to lay flat and fold in on themselves for storage plus these are very affordable at least for quality headphones at 180 if you don't find yourself in noisy spots often these are certainly worth a look if on-ear headphones are more your style our top choice is the beat solo pro on-air headphones aren't for everyone if you have a huge head almost every pair will feel like a vice of course if your headphones have a and c you need that pressure to create a good seal while the solo pro may not be the ideal headphones for everyone they're still feature packed and sound good the solo pro houses the same chip that powers apple's air pods which means you get quick pairing and hands-free access to siri the audio tuning is balanced without the overbearing bass beats is known for i'm convinced these are the best sounding beats headphones to date anc works well transparency mode is handy and the onboard controls are simple and reliable refined design touches also make these a solid upgrade over the previous solo model and a worthy option for fans of the on-air style if you're not sure if any of these are right for you there are a few more alternatives sennheiser's momentum 3 wireless for example is much more refined looking than the competition thanks to a blend of leather and metal these latest members of the momentum family have active noise cancellation eq customization and excellent sound quality i had two main gripes with these headphones though first the battery life is only 17 hours a little over half of what sony offers on the 1000xm3 second the built-in motion sensors for automatic pausing are pretty sensitive and occasionally picked up subtle movements at strange times the noise cancellation isn't as powerful as what sony and bose offer but it'll do the job in most environments the mw3 was a tough sell at its original 399.95 price but now that it's going for around 50 less it's at least slightly more compelling last but not least the sony wh-ch-710n if you want capable noise cancellation that won't break the bank sony's wh ch710 is a solid bit the recently announced headphones cost much less than a flagship model although you will sacrifice a few things the biggest place these fall short is overall sound quality there's decent range and good clarity but they lack deep punchy bass that would help create a fuller sound for casual listeners who want a decent set of headphones that still have a and c these will likely offer enough in the sonic department the wh ch710n has enough sound blocking power to minimize distractions thanks to sony's dual noise sensor technology these headphones pick up a lot of that unwanted noise and automatically select the best cancellation for your environment there's also an ambient sound option should you need to keep tabs on what's going on around you with 35 hours of battery life quick charging and handy on-board controls to round out the features list the wh ch710n offers a glimpse of flagship luxury for around 150 less than many of those options there you have it folks a comprehensive collection of the best headphones you can buy at

headphones|best wireless headphones|best headphones|Under $50|Tech|JBL|Tune 500 BT|Review|Fast charge|Workout headphones,2020-10-07 10:22:45.936520," what is up guys today I'm reviewing the JBL toon 500 bt bluetooth headphones these run about fifty dollars retail price I got them off of Walmart you can get them from JBL's website Amazon anywhere like that these are bluetooth headphones with hands-free calls and 16 hours of battery life so for 16 hours of battery life and only 50 dollars we're looking at a budget pair of bluetooth headphones and I gotta tell you guys for this price range these are very very good and as you can see here one of the main features here is the pure bass 0 cables JBL markets this to have their JBL pure bass sound which is like i guess their signature sound that they put in their professional grade speakers so you also have Siri and Google now it's got a hands-free microphone for calls multi-point connection which basically if you're if the Bluetooth headphones are connected to two different devices say you're listening to music on your computer through the headphones and you get a phone call and your phone is connected to the headphones as well then it'll automatically switch over to your phone so you can answer the call on your headphones so that's a cool little feature I'm not sure if I would ever use it that much but in case you guys do that kind of stuff it's a good feature to have so these are also lightweight and have a foldable foldable design which I'll show you guys here just in a second and the last feature we have here on the box is five minutes of charging equals an hour of music play time so it's got the rapid charge which is really good that's a pretty good comparing to the more expensive headphones on the market and on the bottom here is just some little specifications the frequency response range is 20 Hertz to 20,000 Hertz and then it's a thirty two millimeter drivers and for some reason it says 3.5 millimeter right there for like the auxiliary input but it actually doesn't have an auxilary input it's all bluetooth so go ahead and open up this box it's a really good presentation I do like it especially being a budget pair of headphones opening up the box it's pretty plain and simple you got this background picture nothing other than your manuals and then I here in this plastic you get a little guard to keep them from falling out a micro USB charger so this is one of the minor complaints I have it just seems like most brands nowadays have been moving over to USB type-c and this one has not yet even though this is a fairly new product but that's okay I'm sure a lot of us still have a bunch of these they come with everything speakers all those types of things so and it comes with its own so if you guys don't have one there it is it is nice that it has that fast charging feature though so here's that phones themselves as you can see they are collapsible so you can either collapse them in like this or you can do it to be like that so first of all let's go over the build quality and then I'll talk about the sound quality so for the build quality we have a plastic finish all around the entire things plastic it does feel kind of cheap I'm gonna be honest with you guys it is a pretty cheap quality wise but I mean we're talking about budget headphones $50 if you guys like take care of your things you shouldn't have a problem like me I haven't had a problem with the built quality on these but if you guys tend to break things off in you might have a little bit of trouble with these I do like the design the shininess on the JBL and that circle around it kind of just makes them look a bit more classy and sporty when you're wearing them also the earcup padding on here is pretty cheap as well I don't see it being a problem for me really maybe in the long run something could happen to them but I mean they twist around it's kind of just like cheaper it's very thin feeling definitely nothing like leather as well as this pad here on the top it's the same material you can see how it wrinkles when I put pressure on it but like I said if you guys take care of your things it shouldn't be a problem and then you got your right and left ear cup indicators right there button layout you got plus and minus for volume and playing pause in the middle you can also answer calls and if you double press this middle button it will either activate Siri or Google now if you press and hold the plus button it will skip tracks and if you press and hold the minus button it'll skip back then you have your power button you press and hold for a couple seconds to turn on and then same with turning them off as soon as you turn it on I will go into pairing mode and then you can pair it with your smartphone then press and hold to turn them back off and there's your microphone on the right side here you have your charging port on top so it does get covered up when you're wearing them which could be a good thing or a bad thing it's a little harder to get at but since it swivels so much it shouldn't be a problem you also get the adjustable headband which is plastic on the inside same type of plastic on both sides so build quality is not the best but let's talk about sound quality now overall the sound quality I think is good for the average consumer I think there are really no complaints one problem I did have with was just how their main presentation on the box is pure bass and so that kind of just gives you the presumption of a lot of bass in these headphones which it's really not a ton of bass I personally like the amount of bass but if you want to really be expecting a lot of bass out of these you're not going to be getting that like maybe the Skullcandy crushers it definitely does don't get me wrong it has really good bass it's just not as present as maybe some of you guys would like the bass is not overpowering in any way but it definitely has a good frequency it has deep rich bass that sounds good and I think that is what JBL is talking about in the pure bass marketing that they are showing on the box for the mids the mids are very present and the highs are clear so you're not really going to have a problem with those the different frequencies are well separated it's not like all mush together and muggy obviously these are not the most clear sounding but for what they are for 50 dollars they are great I have no complaints if you guys are looking for something really clear like Bose that's not gonna you're just not going to find that in 50 all our headphones but I think for 50 dollars at this price point it's a really really good sounding headset the hands-free call quality is also pretty well I haven't really done extensive testing on it but I have taken a few calls on here and I had no issue hearing the person and the person had no issue hearing me so the microphone here is it's placed on the right side to where it's kind of facing outwards more towards your face so no problem with that real quick guys I just wanted to mention that I actually started my own vlog Channel Nathan winter vlogs on YouTube I do a lot of adventuring stuff I went to Utah backpacking on a backpacking trip and different things like that so if you guys are into that kind of stuff it would be awesome if you would go check out my channel I really would appreciate the support sorry for them option guys will go ahead and get back to the review they're very lightweight so these are really good I wear them to the gym I've worn um about three times to the gym so these are pretty fairly new but if you guys are looking for a pair of headphones wireless headphones to wear at the gym these would be great honestly they're lightweight they're not too expensive so if something happens you know you drop a weight on them or something it's not going to be the end of the world they definitely do sound great for the gym especially and like I said being lightweight when you're running and stuff they don't kind of they don't flop around they have a good snug fit on your head long time periods of wearing these are not much of a problem for me I never really experienced any pain or anything but it kind of just depends on the person how sensitive you are how your head fits with the them but I had no complaints with the padding or anything like that so overall I think these are great headphones for the price point for a budget bluetooth headphones these might even be the best ones you can pick up I haven't really had a ton of these before at this price but I know for a fact I'd rather spend $50 on these than $300 on beats if you don't want to spend a lot of money on really high quality headphones you just want some to take traveling with you throw in your bag do things like going to the gym these would be perfect for that that's going to conclude it for this video I hope you guys enjoyed it and if you did make sure to give this video a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel for more videos thank you guys for watching and I'll see you next time [Music]"

Further to this review I've created a short video of an audio lag test for them. I can't notice any lag myself. Link is at end of this video.

In my opinion these on ear headphones produce great sound quality for the price which retails from about £30 GBP or $50 USD on Amazon.

know if you guys remember on my personal Instagram I told you guys I was attempted to go full-time streaming because I didn't make it into the UFC just joking around about that but he was my internet connection it was just not fast enough I so I just can't stream sorry guys just want to give you guys an update about that anyways shout-out to Diego if you're watching but anyways just wanted to give you an update due to popular request here here are the Razer hammerhead truly wireless earphones that I personally purchased razors klemming some up-to-date specs with an emphasis on low latency they're super small they're lightweight and they remind me of the Apple earpods a bit what the hell as always being transparent I personally paid for these at their retail price for free to click on my affiliate links down in that video description below for the most updated prices in real time you never know where these things might go on sale and I do make a small Commission if you purchase something from those links I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room and I'm here to help you guys make that purchase decision welcome everyone to another review [Music] all right let me start off this review by giving you guys a bro tip pro tip here the first thing you'll notice they're not in ear earphones you might like that as most other truly wireless earphones have ear tips going into the ear canal and I know for some that might be uncomfortable the hammerhead sits more so on the outside and they are very comfortable in this case there are some downsides to which I'll mention later in this review but they stay in really well there's tons of stability or peace of mind here especially when you're using the silicone cover they provide in the box now testing these for running and other vigorous movements here they stay in ridiculously well now for those intending and using these for I don't know those hot and sweaty yoga sessions maybe running in the rain or so their IP 4 rated meeting they are able to take on a splash of water with my testing spring water all over these things on a video as you can see here the hammerheads aren't holding up perfectly fine now getting a closer look functions and features include a single tap to pause and play you do have to hold it actually for a brief second or so instead of an instant tap which was a bit funky but you do build up muscle memory after a day or two there's double tap to skip triple tap to go back and last is three taps but holding that last one for about two seconds to activate game mode the touch is responsive but the whole thing was just a little bit different for me here though they haven't had truly wireless earphones features Bluetooth 5.0 testing this for distance on both my Android pixel 4 XL and iPhone 10 I'm only achieving 60 to 70% of my 1,100 square foot apartment which is on the lower end of other truly wireless earphones that I have to test it here now with other competitors I'm usually achieving about 90% as for video and razer promotes these are to be low latency i'm normal not game mode i do notice there's an ever so slight delay i'm very minutely lato ad for bluetooth 5.0 but when i do switch it to game mode i do notice that ever so slight delay of being gone now one a good amount of newer truly growlers earphones don't have delays these days and second why can't the hammerheads have low latency or no delay right out the box a little bit funky there as well not implying anything but just essentially why but when you do activate game mode I can on both devices and on both or all three here YouTube Netflix and twitch also test this on the Call of Duty mobile game app and other just random games the delay is gone though and I feel it does live up to that low latency claim now one hurdle I found out you don't have multi parent meaning I can't pair the hammerheads to two devices at the same time and then whichever device I click play on the connection basically jumps over and then plays that source instead I have to disconnect from the first device before I can pair this to a second device or just a heads up on them so folks let's jump into power here razor is claiming four hours per use with twelve additional hours if you utilize their charging case now four hours is at the low end even for budget truly wireless earphones these days if you don't intend on having long listening sessions you might be fine to be fair with my testing playing is that 50% BAM with the same playlist that I use on all of my devices I achieved four hours and 50 minutes now as for that charging case though I do like how slim this thing is here but I do wish the case had a little bit more texture it is a little bit slippery at times especially when you try to prop open this lid the lid itself doesn't have much of a locking mechanism or snapping mechanism to keep that lid open as you can see kind of flops back by itself but other that the case does offer us PC which is a plus and the charge time claims where the earbuds are inside the case it takes an hour and a half from dead to full now before we get into the audio test some things I wanted to point out here these do sound liek a good bit at moderate to large volumes they hammerhead true Wireless have barely any passive noise isolation remember these set more so on the outside of the ear canal some of you might like that since you have situational awareness at all times so you can essentially hear your surroundings for me this is just personal preference here because they're not in ear they're not passive noise isolating I just basically lose my music and movie immersion experience as the audio is not as direct in my ear second I prefer earphones and even headphones with some sort of audio pass-through where you have passive noise isolation from the world if you want and then you can turn on your microphones and the audio in your environment is then pumped in again that's all you'll pass through you basically have options now with these just make sure you know what you're getting you might be okay with that it is a matter of your priorities I guess you can say and honestly the air pods sold like crazy so I'm sure there's a market out there for non passive non in-ear earphones again to be fair so folks let's get into the microphone test here let me give you guys a quick sample hopefully they sound great here but before doing so please be sure to follow me on my social media handles at Jimi loom official or Jhelum official on both Instagram and Twitter respectively on your screen also I'll place it down in that video description also you guys see my efforts in each one of these videos trying to help you guys make that purchase decision smash that like button it's always appreciated here anyways here we go all right folks testing out the microphones on the razor truly wireless earphones so with this tester I'm trying to see if this is isolating my booth with what is going on in the background hopefully also pushing my voice forward so it's clear I mean recipient and once I do that yeah when testing this to a phone call it does play through both earphones and if I were to take one of them out is phone call will still continue uh I notice also a very light breeze going on comment down below guys let me know what you guys think and looking back there's studio all right let's go in first all right testing the microphones on the WUF 1093 slight breeze going on here and of course having these cars whiz by see if it does pick up those noises and see if these microphones actually I should apply post-socialist sometimes around me here as well so let me know in the comments below where you guys think I'm good all right let me get back for this video alright folks let's talk about the audio performance first up these do get quite loud there's no question about that at 50% I'm usually jamming out yet still at a somewhat of a safe level if I'm listening just to have something in the background I'm usually at 30% volume now getting into bass these are punchy earphones bass is fast it's direct and within the app you can activate the bass boost to give these a little bit more depth but want to activate bass boost it sounds to lower the mid-range and it makes the vocal work sound a bit recessed overall it's decent punchy bass that's effective for mass market I believe that the base audio sound signature there the mid-range though not as default setting within the app is the best not the mid-range is president clear with singer's voices being very much identifiable that's a huge plus there the fact that these aren't in ear earphones does make you lose somewhat of that performance as when you actually press this gently into your ears you can hear the hammerheads gets a bit deeper and you can say the music has a bit more depth that is but of course testing these without holding them into my head like so you do lose some of those qualities you do get some audio separation more would definitely have been ideal to help increase resolution interpretation and again that feeling of depth and your music when I'm gaming when I test this on my mobile apps here they sound just really generic kind of shocking to me as a razor are known for the headset and obviously for gaming as well the high frequencies do offer a nice snap though without being screeching on the top them especially for games where bullets are flying or being shot it's not piercing your ears now wearing these while testing I've never had any kind of listening fatigue and they are good for long-term listening now in general they're not bad but we've heard better sounding earphones at the $100 price range with some of the budget truly ROVs earphones that I reviewed in the past these in general or loud they're not bad at all but it's lacking in that audio department also the gaming mode and non gaming mode with that low latency when activated perform similar to other good truly wireless earphones so there wasn't really anything special there low battery life and the funky case here I just really did enjoy this you guys kind of get the gist from me it was just adding up I was hoping Razer would have offered something amazing I was rooting for them I was excited but in the end man these things are again I guess to sum it up generic like I said just helping you guys make that purchase decision folks remember to Like subscribe and add me on Twitter or Instagram I'll catch you guys on the next one you guys take care [Music]

canucks|hardwarecanucks|g pro x,2020-10-07 10:22:45.936702, i can't believe it they finally did it logitech has put a usb-c connection on their gaming product hopefully that expands into the rest the category but the logitech g pro x wireless is exactly what you would expect for the g pro x wireless to be the pro line is really all about the core functionality of this being a solid gaming headset uh in esports and at your home i feel like logitech really pioneered the whole idea behind wireless gaming peripherals being just as good as their wired counterparts removing the whole stigma around latency around battery life around reliability in the heat of the moment and the g pro x wireless is a really good contender on the market but basically all my complaints of the wired version the g pro x still carry over to the wireless version unfortunately so in this video let's see exactly what is different talk about the sound quality the microphone quality and its relation to other wireless gaming headsets that are still worth it in 2020 let's review react to this say hello to proper airflow with be quiet purebase 500dx a compact mid tower with a mesh front panel and three 140 millimeter pure wings two fans that are silent and capable enjoy tasteful argb illumination a type-c port and an easy case to work in check it out below all right so let's begin with some bad news uh the price point 199 dollars that's a 70 premium versus the g pro x the wired version or you can even spend less 99 for the standard g pro that is exactly the same headset but without the blue voice functionality and by the way i don't want to spoil anything but blue voice is just as bad as it is here as it was on the wired version as for accessories all the basics are covered we have the usbc cable for charging a replacement set of velour ear pads there's a carry pouch and the usb dongle that you can store inside the ear cup just rotate it and it will not fall out in terms of design nothing has changed the headset being wireless though has increased in weight slightly versus the original g pro x and the ear cup uh thickness has also increased not the actual cushions but the ear cup itself because that's where you can house the additional components and the battery it is one of the heaviest wireless pairs i have in my collection but you don't really feel that which is a good thing they kind of disappear on your head after a while the leather headband is fantastic feels really premium i do like the pro x over here as well and the stitching on the sides the exposed coiled cable on top of each ear cup looks fantastic and in my experience with the g pro x which is what i've been using for the last like six to eight months as my primer gaming headset i've never noticed this to be an issue and it shouldn't be an issue here either overall the build quality feels okay but the swivel on my wireless version is slightly more loose than what i have on my wired version and my only nitpick about like the design um is the chrome accented centerpieces over here that pick up all types of material and gunk that accumulates in the grooves and also this matte black material that is super easy to scratch the size extensions are necessary here and i wish that we had a little bit more just because i'm starting to appreciate wireless gaming audio more and more now now that i have a virtual reality headset so here's my rift test i'll be doing this comfort test for all wireless gaming headsets in the future let's see how the g pro x wireless handles this uh situation it's not bad the headset is very comfortable the clamping force is not too tight i just wish the ear cushions were slightly thicker so that it would create a better seal otherwise there's a bit of spacing that is created comfort wise outside of vr i find these fantastic even with glasses there's no excessive clamping force i've worn these six hours yesterday and took taking them off there's no ringing ears there's no pressure accumulation anywhere the only two things to keep in mind is that there isn't much padding on the interior so if your ears are larger or like more sticking out and if they do make contact with that internal wall it might not be so comfortable and of course heat accumulation because of the leather ear pads which is why i appreciate the included velour pads which are fantastic for the heat of the summer which is now now given this is a wireless pair all the controls are located on the left side so we have our power switch with the red and blue indicators we have a very smooth volume wheel above that is a mic mute then there's the type-c below the power button and an led indicator the microphone of course is removable but unfortunately there's no easy way to tell which way the microphone capsule should face your mouth i had to remove the memory foam in order to realize which way is the correct way i am not a fan of this volume wheel just like i was not a fan of it on the g915 keyboards for three reasons there's a bit of resistance on it but no ductility whatsoever there's always a bit of a delay between when you adjust the volume on the headset versus when you see the volume bar in windows and number three it is difficult to have precise volume adjustment because of the other two points so you always end up lowering or adding more volume than intended battery life is rated at 20 hours which i think is conservative because in six hours i dropped 20 so if you do the interpolation i should have about 30 hours of runtime the one annoying thing about this wireless player and really all wireless gaming headsets is that if you shut down the system and you power it back on you have to manually turn the headset off and back on again for it to be recognized by the dongle i would recommend having dongle in your site because if the green led is flashing it means this thing is disconnected and if the green is solid it means the headset is connected so now let's talk about sound quality and i gotta say i've always enjoyed logitech wireless audio and this guy is no exception to me they sound almost identical versus the wired g pro x which has natural clean balanced sound and that carries over to the pro x wireless they sound so much fuller and cleaner versus the corsair hs70 that kind of almost sounds hollow they have much better mid-range definition and overall resolution versus the cloud flight but i still feel like the gsp 370 from sennheiser is a better sounding pair just the low end is deeper and richer and if you try to add some bass in the equalizer settings and the g-hub suite it doesn't really work here it kind of falls apart i prefer the default neutral state because otherwise it sounds muddy when any bass is added in here the high note's a beautiful toe really smooth clean there's no hiss in the background even when the headset is at zero volume and i really feel like they've tuned the drivers and the wireless connection to sound as close as possible to the wired version and that's a major positive this headset has excellent passive noise isolation because of the ear cushions really muting out everything that's in your environment and that really helps to pinpoint details in your gaming environment about audio cues and directional awareness you don't need surround sound you don't need virtual 7.1 all that stuff stereo imaging on here is fantastic by default and i really don't know what logitech has done here in terms of surround sound which was fantastic on the g933 and the 900 series of headsets but here it is it's just absolutely not worth it not only does it create a really bad soundstage environment but the bass is incredibly muddy so you lose out a ton of detail on the low end and there is absolutely no advantage in terms of directional awareness when stereo mode is already so good so their new cinematic surround sound to my ears sounds horrible it really pains me to say that honestly because i loved it on the 900 series of headsets but i don't know what happened if i was to place this headset in terms of audio quality versus everything else that i've heard this would be close second right behind the gsp 370 in terms of quality much better than the cloud flight much better than the virtual also much better than the hs70 but it's also a lot more expensive i think the expensive part really comes not from the wireless nature but from the the little blue voice tax as i call it and that is because i feel like the microphone capsule itself as you will hear is just not capable of receiving so many effects of noise gate and compression for it to sound good because by default it doesn't sound very good so applying a bunch of effects on top of that makes it sound worse let's uh let's take a listen so what you're hearing now is that recorded by the pro x wireless without blue voice enabled and by default like if you apply any effects onto this it's not going to fix a poor microphone it's not clear it's highly compressed and doesn't sound natural and it's not exactly what blue is known for right one of my favorite microphones is actually from blue the blue amber which has beautiful warm tones i mean putting blue voice on this package is an embarrassment really but now let's enable blue voice so it can sound worse what you're hearing now is that with the broadcaster one preset and it does add a little bit more bass a lot more compression some noise gate so i am louder but the microphone still is quite poor this is the g2 kenny s preset i don't know how it's in the pro slash broadcaster category because it sounds nothing like it should this is a fun one fm station this is probably what i would use to chat with the boys this is a tsm myth and i do appreciate it we have a lot of flexibility in the software i disabled blue voice just so we can have this conversation without anything applied on the microphone i like i appreciate the idea behind blue voice and being able to tweak each single eq setting and come up with your own preset but it doesn't fix a microphone that is already poor just for reference here's the wired pro x headset plugged into the usb dongle with blue voice disabled one tip is that you have to lower the gain over here to 50 around 50 especially for my voice because otherwise we are clipping and this microphone does sound better than the wireless one that's understandable and actually does sound much better when we enable blue voice as well as long as your gain is controlled so if your gain is too high it will sound terrible if you gain is slightly lower it will definitely compensate adding more bass and it will remove a lot of the distortion that might happen when the microphone is too sensitive right now i have the broadcaster one preset enabled and as long as my sensitivity is under control it does improve the overall vocal quality adding more bass more fullness and more compression to the voice so the wired microphone without and with blue voice does sound better than the wireless now to be fair i feel like all wireless headsets have subpar microphone quality this one is no exception the gsp 370 by sennheiser i mean there's a lot more to be desired in terms of depth resolution of your voice and clarity too it just feels so unnatural and compressed and just to give you another reference point this is the cloud flight also wireless headset with a wireless microphone but with much worse microphone quality versus the g pro x wireless or the gsp 370. but out of these microphones which ones sound the best to your years let me know in the comments and so to conclude i want to say that the pro x wireless i feel like is a welcome addition to the market despite the high price and despite the poor microphone because the audio quality that's a really good benchmark that is competing with the gsp 370 that has its own issues even though it sounds great here it's pretty much smooth sailing and that's a major positive i have no issues trusting this headset and it's audio performance for competitive cs go for eft and really enjoying anything in my gaming library because the sound is good it really does suck though that the surround sound experience is so much worse on the pro x wireless and the pro x versus something like the g935 but the stereo performance here is excellent i just wish that the quality across all features was more balanced in terms of like having good microphone having good surround sound but this headset has battery life comfort and sound quality going for it and everything else is secondary but yeah that's my review of the g pro x wireless let me know what you think in the comments subscribe for more check out this other relevant content and i'll talk to you in the next video yeah it's not a headset for the neck

bluetooth headphones 2017|which headphones should I buy|best wireless headphones 2017|beats x vs bose soundsport wireless|best bluetooth headphones for $100|are beats headphones worth it|are bose headphones worth it|worst headphones to buy|should I buy the bose soundsport wireless,2020-10-07 10:22:45.936728, today I just wanted to do an update video on a product that I reviewed a few months back and that was the bose sound support wireless headphones when i initially made my review i raised about how great these headphones sound and how comfortable they were and how they were definitely the s phones you should be getting if you're looking for Bluetooth wireless headphones well today I have a completely different story yes I still believe that these are the most comfortable in ear boots without holes you can get out on the market today they have extremely soft flexible rubber ear tips that just conform to your very nicely doesn't push anything out of the way doesn't make it feel like it's forced and they're just kind of lays there and sits flat and I have never had a problem easier tips falling out of my ears or anything like that and yes the sound quality is still amazing it's still very much up there is the most clear accurate sounding headphones bluetooth headphones that you're going to find on the market and I still think they beat out of basically all Beats Audio headphones but where they do not seem to be beating their competitors is in build quality in the last two to three weeks these headphones have been completely falling apart on me now I've only owned these headphones for about nine months maybe ten it has definitely not been in here yet so as you can see back here this little rubber right here next to the power button has been peeling off seemingly by itself I do not know what's causing I literally wear these headphones I worked every day I never leave them in my car in the Sun or anything like that so the glue wearing away I don't know what's causing that and then back here next to the little charging port as you can see I had to remove the door that typically is shut down here to seal the soffit make them more water-resistant because the door works so much that it would no longer stay in there and stay stuck or literally just pop out whenever I pushed it in so I ended up just removing that because they got really annoying it's kind of the way of me charging these headphones and then beyond that they're working over here next to the to the port that our port is also warping and peeling off it's lifting up here it's lifting up off this little emblem button they have back here and it's just causing way more peeling and eventually I'm pretty sure this entire thing is going to peel off furthermore this little bun back here has a bull's logo on it literally popped off and sell by itself I didn't rub up against it I didn't bang it against anything I don't know what happened but it literally just fell off while I was wearing them I was sitting at my desk in my office literally not doing any sort of vigorous activity you're moving very rapidly as this sit down and it fell off by itself and it also had this little clip that holds on to the back of the wire of your headphones and keeps them nicely snug to your shirt break on me these handles back there literally broke on me I could go and buy rotational Peyronie's this wasn't so much of an issue because I could literally buy it for dollar placement and the rubber warping and peeling off has only affected the right earbud where you have the power button and the door to charge the left ear but it's completely fine nothing has happened without headphone at all so I'm assuming this is the problem of both manufacturing process they didn't seem to compensate for the fact that you're gonna be consistently pressing the power button and removing the door to charge these headphones over and over again for a long period of time the only other issue I've been having besides the warping in the right ear bud is connectivity for some reason now these headphones would not automatically pair with my laptop or my cell phone sometimes it will perfectly fine and then there's are sporadic times where it just will not connect at all and I have to go into the app and manually set what it will appear to and I've also been experiencing disconnects and I feel like they're starting to become more frequent than they ever were before so my initial review I raved about how these headphones had amazing build quality great sound quality extremely comfortable and I had no issues at the Bluetooth connection and now after 9 or 10 months I'm getting do tooth connection issues almost every day the things literally falling apart on me but hey they still sound great and they are extremely comfortable still so what I still recommend the boss sounds for wireless headphones to anyone absolutely not these things do not last do not waste 100 and what is it 50 bucks on these things I would definitely pass if we're going to spend that much money by the beach X and bartlett's headphones I'm hearing that they're amazing they have great sound quality they don't sound like the typical beats with it's just base it sounding more clearer and more accurate so I'm probably going to pick those up eventually or maybe just try out the Apple earpods but anyway guys that was my update review on this I hope that helps somebody out if you were still considering buying these headphones definitely pass and if you know any other headphones any other wireless Bluetooth headphones that I should check out and I should buy instead of these headphones then definitely let me know in the comments down below because I'm currently on the market but as always my name is Joshua yom-yom stay sexy and I'll see you sometime you [Music]
159,kXnV3IU9TLc,RIZKNOWS,UCAf9vHS_4I9lSu-7gYhkzaw,Plantronics BackBeat Fit Wireless Workout Headphones REVIEW,"Plantronics BackBeat Fit Wireless Workout Headphones review. These are legit sport headphones that I think are a really good value. Not sure if I'd call them the best workout headphones / best workout earphones, but I don't think you'll hate them, let's put it that way. I was pleasantly surprised with these earphones. The sound is good, fit good, comfort is nice, and the remote is feature-packed. They're also sweat-proof and work nicely with iOS and Android devices. Even more, the battery life is ridiculous at 3-5 workouts or 5-8 hours on a single charge. Who's going to complain with that?! Overall, good stuff from Plantronics. Let me know if you like this Plantronics BackBeat Fit review.

reviewing a pair of headphones that I held off on reviewing for quite a while I don't know I guess I just wasn't like stoked on them initially but I've been testing them out for like several weeks now and I was totally wrong they're actually pretty legit and I'm talking about the Plantronics backbeat fit Wireless sport headphones yeah I know they got a long name but it's sort of worth it now before we do get into this review if you're new to my channel make sure you subscribe find that little red button below and click it and also make sure to follow me on Instagram and Twitter and yada yada yada and if you do want to check updated pricing on these bad boys or buy them I'll have a link in the description so make sure you check that out if you want and that's it let's go ahead and get to this thing so the backbeat fit our Bluetooth semi in your headphones which means that they don't have any cables that plug into your music player and they're just completely out of the way they just hang on your head and they sit really nice they're also really comfortable and they wrap around your ears and have like a little rubber piece that secures them in your ear I don't know I guess overall I was impressed with how comfortable they are and the fit now the other thing is that they don't completely seal off your ear canal so you can still hear some of the ambient sound I know a lot of runners actually like this because they can still be a little bit more aware of the things around them I can deal with it either way I can see the advantage of this but I also sometimes do like to have the ear buds create full sound isolation anyways though the fit is good and they're really lightweight and they're secure and they're out of the way and the cable actually just sits on your head it doesn't bobble around too much which is something I was concerned about because it is a flexible cable it kind of just moves with your motion so when you're running it kind of bounces while you're bouncing and then it's definitely not in the way at the gym unless you're like doing bench press and then it can't actually get in a way I thought it was going to hate this but in reality I didn't really mind it at all and the headphones are also sweat proof which is a good thing and it's kind of necessary if they're workout headphones but I thought I should make sure that I noted that and the sound is good for sure I mean if we're talking about headphones that's important and I think it's good it's good enough for me and probably for the average gym goer and I don't think you'll be disappointed with the sound at all now with wireless earphones there always is one catch yes they're less invasive and they're more portable etc but battery life is usually the Achilles heel because you don't have like a lot of room to put a battery but with the back beats I was really impressed with the battery life I was getting like three to five workouts on a single charge maybe like six seven eight hours on a single charge and when you do charge them it's micro USB so you don't need like a special cable I was actually really really impressed with the battery life so I do think that that is a positive but the other thing that can be an issue is compatibility the backbeats support all iOS functions and they work with Android devices as well but I think the experience for iOS users will be better they also do have a mic so you can take and make phone calls and access Syria etc and they have a full remote system however it's much different than any other headphones I've ever used so you will want to consult that manual before you like try and test out these headphones there's nothing wrong with the remote system and actually it's kind of intuitive to like press on your ear to access all the buttons but it's not like you're going to pick these things up and immediately know how to use them so definitely check out that manual but overall the back beats are impressive and I do think that they're like totally overlooked by like everybody most consumers probably have never heard of them but I thought that they're really impressive they even have a four and a half star rating on Amazon with like nearly 2,000 people rating them it's pretty crazy and I think they're a good value at right around $80 that's not that expensive and they're pretty good headphones so if you're in the market for new workout headphones definitely at least try them out give them a go and if you do want to buy them or just check updated pricing make sure to check out that link in the description and that's it for this video I do hope you enjoyed it and found it helpful and if you did click that thumbs up button below it will write me a comment otherwise I don't know if you guys actually like this stuff and also make sure to check out rizz nose comm I'll have a full write-up on there as well on these headphones and there's a lot more content on my website and follow me on Instagram and Twitter and Facebook and all those other sites because I'd love to connect with you guys there anyways thanks so much have a great day"

10:22:45.936800, [Music] due to phone manufacturers opting out of the standard headphone jack we are experiencing a rapid increase in demand for affordable bluetooth headphones now jbl meets this demand with their e-series line of headphones we happen to have the 55 bluetooth edition in red with us which is also why i'm seated in this red children's chair and i may or may not have broken my office chair anyways i'm lily katz and today we are going to figure out if these are worth your 120 or if you're better off subjecting your ears to something else all right let's shake right into it jbl includes the necessities with the e55bt a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack a micro usb cable and that's it these are technically classified as budget headphones and it shows though the plastic housing squeaks and creaks in the hand this fortunately disappears when you're wearing them it's cool that the fabric headband matches the tangle free cable but at first glance it provides as much cushioning as a piece of cardboard normally this would be problematic but the ergonomic weight distribution means that these can be worn for an hour and a half without fatigue even with glasses i found these to be just fine similarly to the biodynamic dt240 pro jbl has opted for synthetic protein leather ear pads not only does this keep costs down but it also appeals to a wider range of consumers design wise call me picky but the 50 millimeter driver housing protrudes way too much relative to the flat headband and generally speaking features are slim if you want a corny joke looks like you're gonna have to phone dad because jbl doesn't include virtual assistant compatibility the right ear cup is outfitted with the power switch and basic playback controls and i mean vanilla bean frappuccino basic there's also a multi-connect button included on that same side the controls aren't great and all three buttons sit perfectly flush with each other this means that using them is a complete guess and check process i didn't like that method in high school algebra and i don't like it now connectivity lags but it doesn't drag if you're streaming video there's a half second to full second delay this isn't ideal especially in a 120 pair of headphones personally i would have preferred aptx compatibility over multiconnect functionality but you win some you lose some and i guess you tie some both jacks on the tangle resistant cloth cable are reinforced with strong stress relievers and the optimist in me thinks that it'll hold up for a while with volume at 50 i was able to exhaust the full 20 hours of music playback from the headphones even at 50 these are loud there's no way that anyone could safely listen to them at that level for more than a few minutes tops i found myself hovering somewhere around a quarter to a third of the volume when you do eventually run out of juice it takes a full two hours via micro usb for the headphones to top back up looking beyond the iffy connectivity jbl has tuned the e55 headphones to have an altered sound signature this isn't necessarily a bad thing as it's enjoyable and meets what most consumers like emphasize bass and highs relative to the mids just don't expect to get a good mix out of them because these are not reference headphones the over ear design helps to create a wider sound stage by taking advantage of the natural contours of our ear now katy perry's swish swish is a prime example of how altered low-end sound can be advantageous for certain genres supposedly response to taylor swift's bad blood if you're one for celebrity feuds swish swish that is hard to say relies on an energetic tempo at 120 beats per minute to carry the nightlife inspired beat overemphasis of the lows pushes into the mids resulting in a drop in vocal clarity for the sake of a more fun sound the bass is much more energetic than listening with something like the audio technica ath m40x which is okay because both headphones have their respective places on the audio stage each is a tool for a specific purpose though not a radio hit lord's sober has plenty of dynamic range to test the fidelity of the mids like swish swish still difficult for me to say the song is overtaken by exaggerated lows while appealing this formulaic beat undercuts lord's vocals causing them to sound recessed hindering the vocals isn't typically a huge issue with poppier rhythms but the song is so lyrically driven that it just doesn't work circling back to the sound stage it's actually one of the best aspects of the e55 bt sound in the last 30 seconds of sober the lyrics limelight lose my mind repeat through the right channel as the refrain comes through the left and right channels lord's voice is easy to perceive as distant relative to the repeated lyrics which sound as if they're being sung less than a foot away from the right ear on to the trouble edgar meyer and chris tyle duet in why only one the reproduction of meyer's upright base performance perceptibly lops off detail from tile's agile mandolin picking upon initial listening the higher end of the spectrum comes through clearly however this is the highest end of the frequency range that we're hearing in the song hence why it sounds so appealing at first listening closer reveals that there isn't much below that point due to the overemphasis of the base which ends up eating into both the upper mid range and the lower end of the treble though the rickety plastic is often too malleable the fact of the matter is that if you're on a budget but you want to dip your toe or even your whole foot into the next echelon of audio the jbl e55bt are worth considering good sound quality is always a gamble with bluetooth headphones especially due to unpredictable interference issues bots the e55bt work well and reproduce a superb soundstage yes yes and yes the sound isn't flat but it is not meant to be rather the e-series is a fun affordable line that brings multi-connect capabilities comfort and good sound to the table all right well that about wraps things up for our review of the jbl e55 bluetooth headphones if you liked what you saw let us

Parker from Digital Trends here and I am here with some of our favorite true wireless headphones now true wireless headphones are a very interesting market segment right now because they are evolving so quickly we're getting new chipsets better battery life better sound and more all this year so deciding what pair you're gonna want to buy is increasingly difficult here are our favorites and why [Music] these are the true wireless headphones you are probably most familiar with they're apples air pods and this is the new version with the wireless charging case we're not the biggest fan of the sort of golf tee design of these headphones but there are a couple reasons that you might consider buying them we call them the best for iOS users or Apple users because frankly they are they connect very quickly and the other thing that they have going for them is this charging case the charging case has a total of 19 hours of battery life in it and the headphones themselves have 5 hours of battery life for a total of 24 hours of listening time on the go that is still pretty good even with the advancements that other headphones have seen if you like the look of the air pods but you want something that's a little bit more rugged you might consider buying the rh8 they have the same sort of golf tee look but in a matte black and the other things they have going for them are rubber ear tips for a better seal and an IP x5 rating which means you can take them outside in the rain you can workout in them and you'll never worry about damaging your headphones that better seal means you'll get better sound quality overall and battery life matches the air pods at five hours per charge but this sleek little charging case vest them by one hour giving you 20 hours of charge from this cool case if you're more of a workout enthusiasts and you want something that's a little bit more ergonomic in your ear the best headphones for you are likely the Jabra Elite Act of 65 T those headphones have an IP 56 ratings so they're waterproof dustproof and sweat proof they offer five hours of battery life great audio quality thanks to nice silicone ear tips and the elite active 65 t also give you access to Google assistant should you need to ask a question or set a timer for your workout if you're looking for the highest quality sound from a pair of true wireless headphones there's really only one great option and that is the sennheiser momentum wireless these headphones sacrifice an hour of battery life in favor of optics and bluetooth 5.0 but they boast sort of the same gergan amma cos i'm we've seen on other headphones and they sound absolutely incredible they offer beautiful highs crisp mids and bumping lows giving you the best dynamics and the widest soundstage that you'll hear from true wireless headphones they come in this beautiful tweed hard case and unfortunately though the case is beautiful it only offers you eight hours of charge so you'll get a total of twelve hours of charge with these headphones that said if you're looking for fidelity in true wireless headphones this is the only way to go now all the other headphones we've talked about so far run in the 150 to 175 dollar range whereas these Sennheiser's will set you back 300 big ones now you do get what you pay for in terms of audio quality but whether or not that sound is worth it for you that's up to you last but not least we have the Samsung Galaxy buds these are currently our favorite true wireless headphones for a number of reasons first and foremost is that they are incredibly small and incredibly comfortable second they offer you six hours per charge so you can listen to your favorite music for an hour longer than Apple's air pods and other competitors like the RHA tick pods their silicone ear tips block in sound and the sound quality is easily on par with any of the rest of these save these $300 Sennheiser's making them an incredible value at just a hundred and twenty-five dollars new that hundred twenty-five bucks also gets you this beautiful wireless charging case which will charge off the back of a brand new Samsung phone as well as on a Samsung charging pad Apple on the other hand

My Playlist for other headphones / Earphones I had reviewed

bluetooth headphones|jbl bluetooth headphones|jbl glide|geekyranjit,2020-10-07 10:22:45.936872, hi there this is ranjit and in this video we'll be doing the review for this budget oriented uh on the year headphones for from infinity indirectly jbl and this is the glide 510 water there's also another model that is known as light 500 that's the slightly older one and that was uh selling for about 1500 this one sells for about 1800 and let's see what we get on the box and as you can see uh they say base and it has dual equalizer for extended base and then normal i'll talk about the sound signature later on and uh it's the big thing is that it says 72 hours worth of battery life and indeed the battery life is really good i couldn't test it for that 72 hours but indeed the battery life is good so this is what you get in the box uh basic blocks that you get i'll just keep this to the side for now and these are the uh what do you say uh earphones and guys uh these are actually on the ear headphones so they sit over the your ears they don't completely cover you so that's a distinction and if you're not used to these kind of earphones it might take you a day or two to get used to it but before we jump let's talk about the physical overview and uh what i feel and it says uh infinity the branding over here and guys the entire thing is actually made up of plastic so entirely it is plastic guys it feels a little bit on the cheaper side especially the buttons over here it's connected via bluetooth uh they feel actually cheap on the right hand side actually we have all the buttons for example the volume rocker and here we have a led light when it's connected this is the power off button that we have and we also have the microphone here and here we have the micro usb port that will be used for charging uh the left ear cup for some strange reason we don't have any buttons it just says infinity on both the sides like this and the ear cups they have decent cushion i would say considering the price point of this one uh but i do feel initially uh you will feel that the clamping force is slightly on the higher side as you can see it won't break if you do like this see i'm doing like this but initially uh you'll feel that the clamping force is slightly tighter so it might take some time to get used to it will get a little bit loose initially the first day it was quite high uh but now i've gotten used to it and uh this is a good thing and a bad thing also it sits over your ears i would say so uh the thing is that even after about half an hour your ears won't get hot because there is a little bit of air circulation on it but again uh it's on here it's not totally so it's a different sort of an experience you will have to get used to it and it doesn't have any active noise cancellation or anything because it just sits over here it does what do you say block a little bit of uh quite a bit of sound around you uh so but no active noise cancellation and anything uh but first let's talk about the work from home uh aspect of this because we i know many of us are actually working from home and we to do video conferencing calls etc first let's talk about that aspect and then we'll talk about the music aspect what do i feel about this one and uh the good thing that i like on this one is the battery life that i'm getting it says about 72 hours i couldn't uh test that completely but even after about now it must been used about 15 16 hours or something like that and it was showing me about uh 72 about 70 battery so again the battery life is really good and for work from home if you are also daily you have to wear this for a couple of hours also then i feel it can last for about almost a week of usage like this so in that respect i would say the battery life is very good uh coming to the bluetooth connection uh again one thing to note is that again guys it's only a bluetooth connection we don't have any vag connection or aux port on this one so if you are thinking that you will connect it via aux port or something like that that's not the case this is a pure bluetooth uh what do you say headphones uh but the bluetooth connection was surprisingly good on this uh one and it did not disconnect even when was under the roof the room sitting in this one and i was taking calls that brings me to the microphone surprisingly the microphone quality on this one is much better than many of the expensive headphones that i have tested for example even sony and sennheiser so that way the microphone quality is good but again don't expect any active noise cancellation or anything for example uh in a normal situation like you are in the room or etc uh the call quality was very good uh the microphone is good other parties never complain but when i went outside slightly it does pick up a lot of street uh sound so there is no active noise cancellation so that is something but again if you're sitting in your house and taking calls the microphone quality is surprisingly actually good i took a lot of calls hours and hours of calls on this one and no one actually complained that i was sounding muffled or anything so that way i feel it is good for what you say that work from home thing that is happening a lot you're thinking if you are a person who takes a lot of calls and i feel uh because these actually do not weigh that much and let me show you with this weighing skin let it reset yeah and as you can see just about 115 grams that it has it's actually pretty light also on your head that way you can actually wear this for a couple of hours and you'll be okay because after some time you don't feel it's there the only thing is that as i told you the clamping force initially will be a little bit high so you might have to like pull it out for after half an hour like this and get used to it but uh otherwise uh because of the battery life and the call quality that i'm getting or bluetooth i feel for work from home this is actually really good now let's talk about what do i feel about the sound of this one and when you get it uh i would say by default this is actually said to that excess base stone and it sounds horrible on that one horrible means the base is so much that it makes you crazy i think so they just equalized it like this the base curve uh fortunately you can change it uh to do that what you have to do is when the headphone is on you have to press both these buttons the volume up and down for a second and then it moves to the normal mode and i used it mostly on the normal mode because i felt that the bass was just too excessive in the regular bass enhanced mode uh so unless you are a bass head just avoid it because even in the normal mode i felt that the bass is actually enhanced quite a bit in fact if you recall recently i had uh reviewed this one the sony uh and this they say is extra bass in fact i would say even in the normal mode this one sounds actually has extra bass than even this one so you get it even in the normal mode the bass is quite enhanced on this one but i feel many uh youngsters actually like that enhanced bass in fact my daughter enjoyed the sound signature on this one definitely boosted bass so for edms rap etc you'll really enjoy it but again if you're sort of a purist you don't like that excessive bass because even in the normal mode it has excessive bass you might not like but considering on the box it says bass enhanced if i have to say uh the base rating i would rate it 8.5 out of 10. now coming to the mid tones here again i think they didn't do anything uh the midtones the vocals are not getting enhanced or they are not forward sounding and the bass slightly leaks even in that so it does give that impression of again bass enhance even in the normal mode uh but uh for vocals and stuff i would say they were actually really nicely produced on this one and if i have to rate it uh for the vocals and stuff i'll rate it about eight out of ten now moving to the higher tones higher frequency treble tones that we talked uh here i felt they it was slightly lacking uh don't get me wrong uh for most of the headphones in this range actually they were produced very well but if i have to be critical about it i would say i did miss that slight sparkle on the treble side with this one and if i have to rate it overall on the trebles high frequencies i would rate it about 7.5 out of 10. the sound stage and the stereo imaging was good i did also watch quite a bit of movies on this one and watched a lot of youtube videos and the movies actually sounded very good on this one that the explosions etc because of that enhanced base even the normal world they sounded very well on this one uh but the only thing is that for example on netflix uh i felt that even at the maximum volume level the volume was simply not that loud compared to many other earphones and stuff uh for music that was not a problem generally i would say when i test headphones and all this i generally keep the volume level at about 60 that's comfortable to me but on this one i had to keep it about 80 percent so again these are not the loudest if you're a person who likes to list very very loud music then you might not like this one uh coming to latency in terms of video and what do you say uh youtube videos and netflix right now watching the good thing is that i did not notice that lip syncing issue but some of you keep asking me about gaming uh gaming if you do you will if you carefully notice very carefully notice you will notice that micro lag there but again that is present even on my bose qc35 so uh you just can't compare that almost no gaming latency very few headsets provide that but if i were to tell any casual player he wouldn't have noticed that uh now moving to uh what do you say uh the overall impressions that i have with this one in terms of sound if i just talk about it yes you know it's enhanced base then i would rate it about eight out of ten but again the uh the build quality is totally plastic on this that is something that i do not like and when you're listening to music and you press these buttons they give you that feeling of cheap build quality that is something that i have noticed but uh again i like the fact that the battery life on this one is really really good the microphone for the work from home is good and also in terms of the sound signature uh they do sound actually good if you are a person who enjoys slightly exaggerated bass even in the normal mode then you might like it i hope i just wish the build quality was better because it it's simply just too much plasticky feeling that you get but still considering some of the options that we have in this price point and this coming from infinity indirectly a jbl company i feel it's a decent product and uh i would rate it uh about 7.75 out of 10. anyways guys that's it for the review of this one i have also reviewed other budget oriented earphones headphones high-end headphones i'll leave the playlist for your reference in the description below anyways guys that's it for now thanks for watching this is ranjit and i hope to see you in my next video take care guys

wireless|solo wireless fake or not,2020-10-07 10:22:45.936901, how's it going folks is Joe with Joe's gaming electronics and today were going to be talking about the Silla 3 Wireless that counterfeit pairs that we've been getting in is to show you guys the difference between fair fake pairs that we get in from repairs we go through them and identify them as fakes we'll send them back to the customer or the real pairs that we saw here and there what's really interesting about the market right now is people aren't catching on really nicely these factories that are doing them aren't getting really clever about the way they match the paints the way they match the hinges but what we're gonna show you is a difference that's going on the inside the headphones along with two quick ways you can identify if you have a fake pair or a real pair the really easy way to do this is if you take your headphones and you plug them into the microUSB we download the Beats updater we'll link it up in our description and then if your updater can actually register your beats through the website then you know you have an authentic paired the real pair you connect it to the microUSB connect it to your computer and you can register it through the beats by dre website on the fake pair you cannot do that that's a really easy way and the way that you can do this at home plug it in take care of it the second easiest way would be to go ahead and put them both into pairing mode when you put these into pairing mode since the solo threes and all three generation products made by Apple have the w1 chip they'll connect really easily to your device and because of that it's really simple to tell if you have a w1 chip inside it and if you do there's a really good chance it's real item so we'll go ahead and put this into pairing mode we'll put this into pairing mode by holding the power button pull the power button for a few seconds and then the lights will start flashing when they do on your device you'll see your solo threes pop up and you'll simply connect them and when you do connect them that's how you know that you have an authentic pair of solo trees we're going to show you guys a few different things as well so right here we have the counterfeit pair and my favorite thing when people say hey I have a fake pair and we get it in and then we tell you that it's a fake pair you say oh but it came in a box and it was new of course it's gonna be new so this is the fake pair it's new right has all these stickers on here because it has stickers that does not mean that you have an authentic pair because it comes in a box does not mean how do you have an authentic pair what's inside the box is it gonna identify if you have an authentic pair or not we're gonna look at the first thing which is the logo if you look at the logo right here the B is actually a little shiny and if you look at the logo here it's a matte and the fake bear has the matte and the real pair has a shine and it matches the hinge the hinges are glossy the hinges are glossy here to look at the headbands the real pair has a light grey beats on top and the fake pair has this white beads on top and overall you the two easiest ways is to just use the w1 chip connection and using the website to identify that my favorite thing to do is put these on the scale and show you guys how to check with the scale not authentic beats use inferior parts which are not as heavy since they're cheaper and we're going to go ahead and put this on the scale and show you guys the difference between one and the other so we'll tear this out and it's a few ounces but since we deal with these every day we ship thousands of these out it's really easy to identify a big formal reel and we're gonna show you guys here with the weight so we got that fake pair here we're gonna put it on I have 7 ounces and then we'll put this authentic pair one we have seven point six ounces it's about 6/10 of an ounce as the difference it's not super big but it's just another way to identify if your beats are fake or not alright and really the last quick and easy way to tell is if you look at the serial numbers here the serial numbers will be on both both of them have a serial number but if you look at the one that's authentic it's very easy to read it looks like it's almost damn tender even though it is printed and it does look a good stamp it's very uniform the way it is we're gonna actually post some pictures in this video as you guys can identify that difference and the authentic and fake ones both have it but the fake one is just mimicking a serial number that's what didn't Apple's database so if you call the serial number and it may be an authentic serial number but there just may be a thousand of them with that same exact serial number so that's kind of the couple unique features about that now what we're gonna do is go a little further inside that fake headphones which are these right here when I tear them down and show you guys what's going on with a fake headphone so I'm just gonna take it and snap them right here so there is the inside of your fake headphones and if you look right here hair is your green board that board should look something like this it's black of course I would want you to snap in your headphones we don't recommend doing this because you can't return this back to the vendor if you decide to break it but this is just a quick way we can show you guys so the board on the inside here is a green has no technology and it just typical Bluetooth and that's right there if we take the other side we're gonna go ahead and break this off pop this inside panel off and see what's going on here so here is the battery if you look here this is the fake battery this is the real battery looks at the fake battery is 350 milliamps the real battery is also 350 milliamps there's different types and if you look at the power board the power board is green the power board should be black also low 3 Studio 3 power beats 3 I'll have a black PCB just so you know so that's that and then we're gonna do a quick muff test so we're gonna peel this muff off you can just tip just your fingertip underneath and pop right off it's fake it's gonna come out very easy so here is the muff that's counterfeit there is real month one quick way to tell if it's real or fake is the fake counter that counterfeit pairs will have more of a glossy finish on the leather and the real ones were having more of a matte finish and it'll be just a better looking muffin general the material they use is much better we're gonna take a knife and cut this token so this is that counterfeit here and if you look at the counterfeit pair here you can actually see right through here you can see right through it's much easier to see if it's a white pair but you can see right through if you put something behind it if you look at the legit pair there's a lot of padding behind there and you can't see directly through but we're gonna take this fake pair and cut it open if you look inside here this foam here is blue it's a very common foam use it's very cheap you'll see a lot of student you the two months with this really crappy blue foam and this is a lot of the stuff that fake companies are using because the cheapest bill of materials they want to create it sell it and move on and we'll go ahead and open authentic them off what you'll see on the inside is a really nice slow rebound foam which will be yellow and some of them use black as well it depends what factory they're made in so those are the couple things that we could do to help you guys out just identify what is real what is fake the counterfeit here here is fake and try to do your best to state to secure websites we sell thousands of beats and we still own the authentic product if you guys need your headphones repaired you'd like to purchase some product from us visit our website Jones GE calm you guys gonna always email us we're willing to assist you guys our email support at Jews GE comm or give us a call our number is two zero one eight nine eight five six three seven will link all this up in our description and hope

the top Bluetooth headphones that we found under 2000 rupees these are four wireless headphones that not only make the price racket but also deliver really good quality sound in that price bracket if you like top tech videos don't forget to smash that like button and hit the subscribe button if you're not already a part of TMI again we have lots more top tech coming up so leave suggestions for future top tech videos in the comment section below if we choose your suggestion we'll post your comment in the video itself the first product on our list is the boat rockers 510 now these are Wireless bluetooth headphones and they are available in a bunch of colors the primary design of the headphones is more or less plastic but you do have integrated controls on the headphones of themselves so you do have volume controls as well as track forward and back controls and you also have a phone call button conveniently located on the side which also doubles up as the power button there's also a nice-looking LED above the button so that you know that your phone is paired to the headphones when it blinks blue now these headphones offer up an average battery life of about 9 to 10 hours which should be useful for a lot of people especially if you are using the headphones throughout the day 9 to 10 hours should be good enough for a full day's use if you are a heavy listener or a week's use if you are a light listener as well the headphones are also well cushioned with a nice head cushion as well as ear cushions on both the ear pads are really soft and comfortable the headphones are also lightweight weighing in only at 230 grams the sound profile is overall pretty well balanced a good amount of bass and mid-tones are also well matched there's not a lot of volume in these headphones unless you're using some sort of an amp because they do have an inbuilt 3.5 mm headphone jack as well so if you have boosted audio you'll get really good volumes from this but if you are using these over Bluetooth you might like to hear a little bit more audio if you are somebody who listens to their headphones turned up to max but overall the sound profile is good the headphones are lightweight and comfortable they're available in a bunch of colors and they're available for a good price as well so go check these out next up on our list for a price of 1289 are the Motorola escape 200 over the Year headphones now these headphones are available in a on-air style as well so if you don't like over the ear headphones you can choose the on-air style these are super lightweight they offer up 15 hours of playtime have 40mm drivers and are made out of a really good quality plastic as well the foam pads are really nice and soft and cushiony the headphones have a lot of stretch in the headband as well so you can really put them on and they are comfortable to wear for long periods of time we found the sound profile to be slightly flat so if you enjoy flatter sound profiles if you're not going to be boosting the bass quite a lot these headphones should match up they also have a novelty feature where in which you can trigger alexis city or google now directly from the headphones so if you have any of those assistants that you use you can use them with the Motorola Escape headphones they do have an inbuilt microphone for phone calls as well and you do have a 3.5 mm headphone jack if you want to use them as wired headphones so all in all a pretty good set for the price that they are available at go check these out next up on our list for under 1,000 rupees of the eyeball decibel are the ones that we got our gold in color and they look fantastic according to me but they're also available in an all black for a subtle look and blue and silver and another blue and silver with the silver ear cushions as well so depending on what color profile you want there quite a lot of options here and they're priced under 1000 piece now the one thing that you'll notice right off the bat with these is the way that the right side and the left side ear cups are shaped when you put them on like regular headphones they are slightly awkward while fitting on your ear so you have to tilt the headband back a little bit to get a slightly better fit ideally they would have been better if they were reversed so if the left side was on the right side and the audio profile was configured like that then these would have been better if eating headphones so I don't know what the design choice was but the color scheme the ear cups as well as the headband are really nice and soft so they're comfortable for long periods of use they're also quite flexible and fold down for easy transport they also have a 3.5 mm headphone jack so if you're somebody who wants to listen to audio on a cable you can do that as well these earphones also have FM radio so if you're somebody who listens to FM radio these will come in handy for that as well again just like our the previous headphones the eyeball decibel is Alexa enabled so if you have Google or Alexa you can launch it from the eyeball decibel and use it to tell Alexa your commands as well as the sound profile is concerned the headphones sound good they do distort a little bit on the maximum volume but if you are one step down they sound amazing good amounts of bass good amount of mid-range and for the price you can't really complain really good overall package considering the colors and they are lightweight they should last you about eight to ten hours in terms of battery life depending on how you are listening to them overall a good package for the price under 1000 please go check these out so the final headphones on our list are the Infinity Glide 500 wireless headphones now these are a sub brand of JBL really good quality build materials on these headphones a really solid headband along with a lot of flex in the headband as well really soft cushions on the ear cuffs they don't have any cushioning on the headband and the size of the headphones can also be extended to make it quite large as far as the drivers are concerned they're 32 mm drivers and a really good quality sound from these there is a 200 milliamp hour battery that charges up in about one and a half to two hours they also offer up speed charging in ten minutes and they offer up upwards of 18 to 20 hours of usage on these headphones which is absolutely fantastic they are voice assistant enabled so if you are using City Google assistant or even Alexa they will work directly on the headphones without any problem they do have an inbuilt microphone so if you want to make your voice calls you can do that as well they are lacking a headphone jack so you'll not be able to connect a auxiliary cable directly to the headphones they're also available in three colors black that we have over here blue and red and overall the sound profile is extremely well balanced are really good amounts of bass on these headphones one of the best in the lot good amount of mid-range as well if you are somebody who likes a lot of bass out of the folder of the JBL infiniti definitely get the pick for the maximum amount of bass and a really good quality fit they are slightly tight on the ear and do pinch in on the head but all-in-all an extremely well balanced headphone for the price definitely go check these out so that's it for this list guys if you like lots of bass definitely go pick the JBL Clyde if you're somebody who wants FM radio on their headphones you can pick the eyeball decibel if you want a flat sound which you can tweak around with an equalizer on your smartphone maybe you can go for the Motorola escape and if you're somebody who's using some sort of an amp or would like to boost the audio from the PC or your smartphone if it has a DAC enabled then you can definitely go for the boat headphones all in all a good pick under the 2000 degree price bracket ranging all the way from under 1000 all the way up to 18 99 go check these out if you liked the video guys don't forget to smash the like button hit the subscribe button if you want to see more top tech videos as always guys if you have the bail

my review on the sony MDR RF 985 wireless headphones so these are headphones that work great for watching movies or TV even YouTube videos on your computer so I'll be talking more about the sound quality features and comfort of these headphones I think for a lot of people these are a great value especially considering they're under $100 but there's a few reasons you might want to consider something else or something a little bit nicer so I'll talk more about that as well also check below for any updates about these headphones including where to get them at for the best price also include a link to a group review I'm doing on wireless headphones doing basically a head-to-head kind of side-by-side comparison to help you figure out which one might be the best choice for you so again check below if you're interested in a link to that video so go ahead and walk you through the features of these headphones and show you how the basically how they work and give you a quick idea for the setup so these do come with your RCA cables and how this works is it depends on your audio source if your audio source has a right and left output you can go ahead and plug this into the output of your audio source and plug this into your audio input to hear if however your TV or blu-ray player or whatever only has a single audio output you plug this cable into that audio output and then you can go ahead and plug these into your audio in one so either option works great you have a three different channels here you can select so this is something to help make sure you have the the best signal of course this comes with the AC adapters your power source and that just plugs in right here in terms of the battery life these last up to 25 hours it will depend on how loud you listen to your music or movies and what you're listening to the first time you charges it'll take about 3.5 hours and then after that it just depends on how drained they are to recharge the headphones they just basically sit on here and then you'll see a little red light come on letting letting you know that they're charging now you can use these with your TV with your blu-ray player with your PC as long as whatever you're using them with has an audio out I know one question people will have is can you use multiple headphones with this particular receiver and the answer is yes you can actually use an unlimited number of headphones with this base or receiver now regarding the differ buttons you have you have your power on and off here so again when that's off you just turn it on and it will connect seems seamlessly with whatever you're listening to these did a really great job of that they pair it really quickly like just within a split second over here you have your volume and you just basically scroll this down or up depending on how loud and basically has numbers going from zero to ten which is which is helpful so if you know there's a volume you usually like to have that you can actually just look and see to make sure it's at the correct volume so I actually really like that feature in terms of the ear padding these are comfortable they're kind of that old-school look as far as the padding goes but as you can see they're definitely nice and big ear cups there so I think anyone's ear should fit comfortably in here I know these actually feel a little bit big on my head but definitely comfortable also as you can see the ear cups do pivot back and forth here they don't pivot side-to-side but regardless you're still able to get a really comfortable fit and then in terms of the headband up top here also very comfortable you notice there's no cushion right here at the very top where it charges and that's not a problem at all I wouldn't worry about that these are still very comfortable now one thing I will note about these is they do kind of have that plasticky feel and you can kind of hear a little bit now obviously when these are on your head you're not flopping the ear cups around but you know just if that's important to you just something to consider as far as adjusting the headband itself has a click adjustment which is great so you can find a comfortable fit that way so in terms of the actual wireless signal these have a range of up to 150 feet what I found for myself experientially was I could definitely walk around the first floor no problem even the second floor but when I went up to the third floor I started to get some more static so what that means is you there's certainly the range will depend on how many walls you're going through and you know in your distant in distance from the base or receiver that way but I feel like these should have plenty of range for anyone you know let's say you're watching TV or a movie and then you want to go to the kitchen grab a snack and then come back and just not have to you know pause whatever you're listening to these should work just fine for that now in terms of the clarity of the signal what's interesting is the first time I use these I notice just a little bit of static but I played around with them I played around with the channels I also just unplugged and replugged everything in and then when I listen to him again it was crystal clear so just keep that in mind if you end up getting these for yourself and you do notice a little bit of static and I've seen that some of the reviews on these as well just try tweaking them a little bit playing around unplug replug in some stuff and see if that makes a difference and then once once like I said I got a really clear signal they sounded great so there's no static no hiss it was a really nice signal now I did get one pause where there was just a slight pause in you know I was watching a movie where the audio just went silent for like a split second otherwise everything's been really smooth and easy to listen to signal wise with these so next I want to give you a live sound leak test to get an idea of how much sound leaks out of these at different volume levels now this the volume adjustment goes from basically zero on up to ten so start it out at three and then increase the volumes to get an idea here so I'll go ahead and turn them on and they're at three starting out here so this is what I consider a semi quiet volume here you may not be able to hear anything right now and then I'm going to look at this and turn it up to say six this is definitely a good volume to listen at and then I'll turn it all the way up to ten so you can hear it out of the headphones and I'll put them on so again this is full volume so hopefully that gives you an idea of how much sound leaks out of these again at different volume levels the nice thing is they don't leak as much sound is say more open headphones would so if you're trying to enjoy a movie or watching TV and you have someone next to you that maybe they're sleeping or you just don't want them to hear what you're watching these certainly could do a pretty good job for you that way now in terms of the volume I find it goes plenty loud for me again turning it up all the way I really wouldn't want to go beyond that I even even that's a little bit too loud for me to watch a whole movie at but if you really like loud volume you may find that these don't quite get loud enough for you so next I want to talk about the sound quality of these overall these do a nice job you know I would kind of say 4 out of 5 stars the bass is there it's present so that it really rounds out movies in particular so for instance when I was watching Tron Daft Punk is playing in the background quite a bit there's just lots of bass in that movie and these do a nice job I felt like it was enjoyable you get some of that punchy you know you get some of that hitting hard hitting bass not it's not particularly hard hitting or throbbing and it's not particularly tight and refined but it does a good enough job that it makes the movie fun to watch same thing for Pirates of the Caribbean you know sometimes you have the boom of the cannon or you know whatever it is and you feel like okay cool there is enough bass in there to kind of bring it to life and it make me you know ultimately feel satisfied about the listening experience so the mids and the highs likewise they do a nice job I wasn't blown away but ultimately I felt satisfied like yeah there's enough detail there's enough clarity they definitely add to the experience and ultimately for me that's what I'm looking for especially for movies now to be critical I would say they are a little bit tinny sounding and at higher volumes I felt like that listening fatigued or listener fatigue can kind of set in to where you know it's hard to listen to these at loud volumes for long periods of time so that's me personally getting your experience maybe a little bit but that's what I found with these but regardless I felt like they still did a really nice job and definitely a good value for the money now in another positive note one thing they did an exceptional job of really is being able to give you good dialogue and also balance out background music or explosions and things like that sometimes what can happen particularly when you're watching movies is you'll get these loud explosions or the soundtrack will kick in and it's so loud you have to turn it down and then people start talking and they're too quiet so you got to turn it up again and you're just going back and forth and it's annoying I can't stand that but these definitely don't do that at all it's really well balanced so voices you can definitely hear what people are saying so for example let's say you're watching TV with others and you're someone who always asks people to turn the tv up so you can hear what they're saying and they're like no the TV is too loud what are you talking about these would be great you can put these on you can turn it up and definitely hear what people are saying and get it the same you know token these don't leak a lot of sounds you're not going to bother them all so they stay synced in terms of with the TV so it's not like you see people's lips moving and and it's mismatched or any any of that so they work really great that way so bottom line the sound quality of these is good definitely should satisfy I think most people especially if you have the right perspective you're not expecting these to sound like headphones that cost two to three times as much but ultimately you're getting your money's worth and you're getting a really nice sound experience so go and wrap things up with some final thoughts my recommendation regarding these particular wireless headphones by Sony what I like most about these headphones is the fact that I consider them more of a budget-friendly wireless headphones you're under $100 you're getting headphones that sound nice and they are very comfortable I mean you can really wear these all day long also I really like that you can watch movies or TV and they balance out sound from whether it's dialogue to background music to explosions so nothing is out of out of balance there where you're having to turn the volume up and down all the time it does a great job of keeping everything even-keeled now some reasons you may want to consider other headphones would be one of course from a sound quality standpoint if you really want a higher sound quality you want a tighter bass you want more refined mids and highs you really want the hair to stand up on the back of your neck when you're watching a movie then that's where you want to look at spending more money it's not so much a different pair of headphones at this price point it's more about spending more money to get that kind of effect if it's not a big deal or you really don't want to spend more than $100 on you know wireless headphones to use these would be a excellent choice they're super comfortable they sound good they really get the job done so hopefully this review was helpful for you as always leave a thumbs up if it was I appreciate that and do check below again for any updates about these headphones especially where you can get them at for the best price and also if you're interested in the group wireless headphone review check below for a link to that video as well but otherwise thanks for watching appreciate your time and hopefully I'll see in another

daddy was going on today yeah so I'm gonna be talking to you about the JBL Sprint wireless earbuds so JBL basically has a line of these new wireless earbuds that they put out one of them is called sprint which these ones ones called jump and the other ones called something else whatever I've maybe I don't know they're all forms of exercise anyway I wanted to sprint ones I need a good pair if you know wireless earbuds working out was kind of sick of using my Apple earbuds they weren't Wireless of the wired ones and you know the wire just gets in the way now I'm one of that first of all but also somebody wanted something that was you know a little more durable I wanted you know these earbuds that were sweat proof and honestly so far these have really just hit the mark I mean they've been they've been really good bluetooth is excellent Bluetooth has some pretty solid range to it you know I can step away like you know 10 feet or whatever from my phone and do some you know pull like push-ups or crunches whatever and like I said I can still get my music on and they also charge super fast like right out of the box it only took about 10 minutes and I got a good like hour of listening time in before they started to die so they do charge with a fast sound quality on them which is you know obviously the biggest thing or for a lot of people it's the big thing when when spending this kind of money on on your buds sound quality in my opinion is pretty great for the price and I own some very very high fidelity headphones and so I know what you know I think I feel like I have a good idea of what good sound is and you know I think for for the price I mean these produce like a pretty good sound I don't know what kind of drivers are using but it's it's nice there's definitely a little bit of hype in the treble so that's one thing you know you're definitely gonna hear when I say that I mean like the higher sounds you're gonna hear those a little little crispier than the lower sounds so that's that's one thing to keep in mind especially if you're used to something like beats which have that like really fat bass response a little different but you can definitely hear other than that you know you can't you get a pretty pretty true true sound with you know your music and that's that's awesome so small price so this thing they are they I do have touch controls so this one right there no it must be dead anyway basically what you do is you can there you go so you hold it down for a couple of seconds ends on EPEL thats on so that's kind of cool and then can you know kind of turn them off move it up and down to change the volume double tap to ask for it or or rewind or whatever I will say while that's like pretty cool that it's like touch like that touch not really touchscreen but touch control whatever they are little finicky you know I've definitely like I was running the other night and you know I tried to like press it and it just like kept pausing instead of skipping and I was trying to double tap and then when I was trying to pause it would double tap and skip and and even like a little like drop a sweat our big whatever big drop of sweat and change it so that's one thing they could have had maybe done a little better but it works and I control all the stuff in my phone anyway so I don't think you know it's totally like a big deal for me but you know and then the design the secureness i guess you could say that took me a little little while to get used to so essentially you take it you face it down put it in your ear like that and then you twist it and this part is basically shapes like the inner piece of your ear so you'll notice that it like twists in there and then sticks the cool thing is it does get very very secure so you don't have to worry about these falling out at all even if they do you know you have this little line so that can kind of hold on to them and save them but they do feel like really tight at first so they're gonna take a while to get used to it's almost like like breaking in a new pair of shoes or something like that you know other than that even they have a very ergonomic shape there's like a magnet right here between this piece of the bud and the top so it does stick nicely right there you have to worry about that falling off for charging it comes with this little cord right here you know this little cord for charging and then multiple like ear buds rubber ear buds so you can you know get different sizes I put the small ones on because I like those most smaller ears I guess but yeah overall you know if you're looking for a solid pair of wireless earbuds to work out I would highly recommend these again that the JBL Sprint's yeah take it easy you

I don't like freelance For the time being, I'd like to introduce the accessories that are inside. This area got off and it was the last opening video, but it's gone. Manual Earpiece mountain size is the main body, so it looks like this After all, it has a unique shape. Speaking of shaved head, it has this type of shape. Yes, this is the feeling of taking the earpiece. This is the shape of this circular 2 It ’s not that straight to your ears because it feels like it ’s growing like this. I dare to follow the shape of the deep ear hole. Yes, that's right. High in the direction of the sea child This is the one that fits in very well. It's in the direction of that ear shape. It's a bald part because it goes in smoothly. This wing part is the ear The fit pan is very comfortable to wear because it gets caught here. It makes me feel that it seems that it will not be easy to remove even if it moves because it is excellent in gold. It ’s easy, is n’t it? There is almost no feeling of oppression. [Music] It feels like a completely wireless earphone, where there is a fine driving time Well, it's said that it's put in such a small earphone, so it won't drive for that long time, but this The shaved ys earphone is quite amazing and the driving time is the 5th hour when the book is fully charged. If you fully charge this charging case, the earphone Since it can be fully charged 3 times, it takes 5 hours on the main unit and 10 hours on the battery, so it's about 15 hours, isn't it? In the unlikely event that the earphone battery runs out, it is possible to charge Kudo for 45 minutes with a charge of 15 minutes. It has a quick charge function. On the contrary, it is a condition that you can keep moving for 45 minutes with just a 15-minute break. SoundSport-free is a functional aspect that I thought was a little interesting, but with its unique acoustic design, if the volume is loud, it will be eco-friendly to match when the volume is low. Even if it's a small sound that gives you a powerful sound, even if it's a loud sound, it resonates with 8 thoughts. It's an earphone that looks like it's hungry. Water It's strong against sweat. This is true from the front of the boy. Even with that ordinary wired earphone, it's like fluttering its own water. I wonder if I can check the durability or go with the water used even if it is not water. 8 It will be a person who wants to pass the endurance test a building This is a story this time, but this is a big deal It ’s not waterproof, it ’s not waterproof. Just remember that it ’s resistant to water and sweat. Also, by using the shaved connect app, if you should lose this earphone, it will help you to find earphones. It's a nice point, I'm worried that it will be lost because it is small. Well, such a customer may be relieved if it is linked with this application, but maybe it was lost in the prince. 4 Yes, I was listening to the sound, but after all the amulet I don't feel it at all. Is this because it's an open earphone? It is very characteristic that the sound spreads to the left and right, and the taste is good with normal canal type earphones and other earphones that allow perfection. It has an incredibly natural expanse, and it feels very comfortable to wear, so what do you call it sports or everyday life? Rather than listening to music, that life I think that it matches the style of listening to music very much in the room. The big one is that there are few low temperatures with other earphones. It seems like it's not like that, and I think there are quite a few customers on the moon, but that's why I put it all in. Because I'm this well I'm an opening video At the time when I made the opening video, I thought that the origin of this was the strongest Shibamoto Ys It's just a personal personal feeling, personal memories It's pretty clear that it's already gone, I imagine that if they were the ones, I would probably put the best-in-class Neucan on it. Well then, this time it ’s not a noise canceling model, but a sport. It was a product with a clearer and more natural sound and a complete sound of 8 seats, so don't think of it as shaved = Neucan. Please enjoy the shaved earphones with wired earphones. However, shorts are good. Especially in the treble range. Naruyoshi Kikuchi's bait in South America, where I often listen to 8 confirmations of that sound source I also asked Ra and Yaraba. It's a very high level earphone. That piano Mari feels really good. After that saxophone, it's a degree bass, isn't it? The low is here. The basic high girly-like interaction feels very natural. What is often said by that customer is that other complete yl water books. You're talking about not writing with a spear, right? It ’s a wish, but it ’s a little big, but I do n’t think that ’s the case. It ’s my personal Kiguchi bouvet Zain are here 1 year ago are here Talking about volume control It's not a tap Is this the end? There are 3 buttons here. Volume up / down and multi in the middle Function buttons Use these three buttons to control the volume and stop playing music. This is a bit real, isn't it? It may take some getting used to because it feels like this. I just want to stick to the sound quality while listening to music. For those who say, is this shaved completely wireless earphone sound sports free wireless? It's highly recommended, but I'm sure it's more fun and happy to have the function of ion capture, such as the function of Neucan. It's a selling point that the skin simply sounds good, isn't it? Completely, you can feel the spread of sound that is rare for us earphones. Earphones were introduced to Bose SoundSport Free, and we are now preparing 3 colors for you. Please choose the color that suits your taste. Please select Also, you can watch these earphones at each good store. Please feel free to sell it to a good bargain near you today. Po-chan guided us from the Osaka Nihonbashi store. [Music] Hmm 4 minutes"

10:22:45.937139, alright guys so welcome back to a brand new video today's video we're going to be looking at a new pair of over the ear headphones in fact this pair is not even out yet I looked them up online and it doesn't look like they come out until the first part of May but somehow my local target happened to have them so I picked them up so that we can take a look at them for the first time here alright so the pair I'm talking about is the JBL live 500 bt now upon the first time that I checked out the box and what you guys may see is it looks a lot like JBL z55 series and to be honest it's very similar but there are definitely some improvements and at 150 dollars a very impressive value in this headphones alright so one of the first things that I want to point out since we're gonna look and see what's inside the box is the first thing that I notice is for $150 it didn't come with a case not even a pouch and JBL in the past at least had a little drawstring pouch that you can throw the headphones in and at least feel comfortable that you can throw these in a bag without him getting scratched up but these not coming with a case was the first thing I noticed just throw one of those really crappy bags in there just to keep this thing protected and although other than that you do get a micro USB cable for charging again it's micro USB and I'm still trying to figure out why companies are using these other than the fact that these are in a closet that they're pulling from to be able to supply this now a huge plus for me is that it comes with the three-and-a-half millimeter braided cable most people are not gonna care at this point but I do like the fact that I can use these wired if I want to alright so now we can go right into the headphones the first thing that I do want to point out is that they have 30 hours of battery life and that for $150 is really impressive the build quality on these is actually very similar to the e55 s it has that cloth like material it's very similar to the case that comes on the pixel in fact I have the exact same case for my pixel that matches this JBL's branding is right on top there really is no padding on this at all but it's not a big deal because this is one of the lightest headphones that you'll find especially when it comes to over your headphones now you have a little bit of gloss where it says live right here in the corner now this gloss does pick up fingerprints so this is gonna be something you definitely want to wipe off from time to time you see JBL's logo on the side now the ear cups on these is a pleather material it is very soft it's deep enough that your ears are not gonna hit the inside you can see that your left and right are marked inside the ear cups themselves now on the left hand side just by simply pressing and holding you can summons Google assistant or Siri or Alexa and all of those just by doing that now the other good thing is when you have a notification you can simply just tap the side of them and it will read you your notification so that's a huge plus especially if you don't have your phone on you and it's on the other side of the room so if you're in a gym you can basically hear all your notifications within the headphones and the other huge advantage even though again without a case I don't know how much it matters these do fold flat and they also fold inwards so that they're very small now also on the left hand side on the bottom you can see that is where your micro USB port is for charging now these do have the quick charge feature where you can charge these for 15 minutes and get two hours of use and I can't tell you how many times that saves me because I can pick up headphones they're dead it's like damn it but you can plug them in for 15 minutes and then you have two hours which is more than enough to watch most movies or to be able to go to the gym and listen to music for quite a while alright and JBL if you're familiar with them at all they have the switch on the right hand side that if you push it up once it'll turn them on and connect them if you haven't connected yet just simply push the button up and hold it and it'll put it into pairing mode right underneath that you have your volume up and down you have your multifunction button in the middle which if you pressed twice will go skip a track forward you press three times it will go backwards right underneath that is the headphone jack so that if you do want to use these wires you can and then you have your Bluetooth button right here to be able to go to different devices if you have them connected to different devices and then the ambient mode this is another thing that's popular within headphones and they have ambient if you just kind of want to hear your surroundings and then they have a top-three mode so that if somebody comes up to you you can actually carry on a full conversation your music stone really are backwards and the microphones are pulling in vocals very clear I felt like I used that feature a lot it comes in very handy I really don't like having to pull headphones on and off expecially when people come in to talk so that right there is a huge plus durability on these they feel slightly tight so I think over time that will loosen a little bit but that is signs of concern that maybe there is a breaking point in here but I still feel like I can turn these a good bit and not have anything to worry about but now we need to get into sound and to get into sound the first thing I don't want to point out is you definitely want to make sure to download JBL's app JBL's app is giving you control over EQ settings even the talk-through and ambient mode functions but the EQ settings even though you have your ability to do custom eq's I found that the bass mode was absolutely the best I found that listening to all genres it didn't make anything sound muddy because these headphones are some of the brightest clearest Bluetooth headphones that I've heard now it does have JBL's like what they call a signature sound and that's where the clarity is boosted but the bass is really tight and punchy I think for 150 dollars I'm completely blown away and out of bluetooth headphones that's come out lately this is one of the best pairs that I've heard in quite a while and I think at $150 it makes it even that more impressive and the sound is just truly incredible the volume is so loud there's no Distortion the soundstage is fairly open it never felt closed in but it definitely didn't feel super wide either but the bass if you're a bass head you're not looking to get like the Skullcandy crushers but the heads shattering bass these are able to do and the tight punchiness that these have it's truly amazing how JBL puts out a headphone it feels like there's nothing to it it's really light but once they're on your head as you can see there's a very slim clean looking headphone it's not big it's not obnoxious it doesn't stick out much I think these headphones could have even been $200 and I would have had no problem recommending these to anybody so the fact that there are a hundred and fifty fifty dollars even the JBL a 55 series you can still see them in stores for $150 this is a huge upgrade in my opinion as far as sound goes and to be able to get the assistant features and be able to hear your text and stuff like that in the headphones they're giving you better value and not jacking up the price which a lot of companies are doing this days I'm not gonna single out any company most of you probably know who I'm talking about guys that kind of wraps it up for a hundred and fifty dollars you're getting a pair of headphones that has 30 hours of battery life but you're also getting quick charge feature which again benefits me as I like to just charge a headphone for a few minutes and be able to listen for a couple of hours so that's a huge bonus has premium quality sound across all genres I didn't find a genre that I did not like this with and again vocals the clarity the crispness and the punchiness of the bass this is like the perfect sound signature for me so if you've ever wondered what I look for as far as sound in a headphone this pretty much sums it up but guys thank you so much for checking out this video thank you guys so much for checking out all the other videos and as always guys make sure to stay tuned for more

what's up everybody should boy floss back again with another video and today we're gonna take a look at the sony WF SP 802 Lee Weyer 'less earbuds that feature digital noise cancellation now you can pick these up on Amazon I'll put a link up in the description the price on these 200 bucks now they come in three different colors you got black blue and orange alright so at the end of this video I'm gonna answer three questions number one are these worth 200 bucks number two do they sound better or equal to the Sony m3s and number three where it is ranked at against my top three truly wireless earbuds that have noise cancellation as of right now number one on my list is Sennheiser momentum tools number two so many entries and number three air pop pros alright so let's go to the features real quick you got your Google assistant and your Amazon Alexa built-in now you got extra bass 9 hours worth of battery on a single charge with an additional nine hours using the charging case now you can bump that up if you turn off noise cancellation that is ip55 sweating water-resistant bluetooth technology and you got 360 reality audio let's see anything else now you got fast charge so ten minutes of charge will give you 60 minutes of play time you got to touch controls you do have an app that's available for Android and iOS crystal-clear calls alright so you can use this I have to talk on the phone USB type-c charging alright so all that for 200 bucks let's see what it is shoutout to white shoes she got the day off yes I get to one deck let's get busy okay now in the side note just in case you wondering what's the major difference between these and the m3s these are water-resistant two entries aren't the entries should have better noise cancellation and these should have a better fit than the m3s so these are basically similar but you would get these for the gym now you get the 800 ends for the gym okay let's see what you got inside here now I'm gonna try to make this video quick so let's not not beat around the bush giggity all right so we got a nice presentation alert okay Quick Start Guide let me file that these are gonna be your earbuds now like I said this should be more comfortable and easier to wear to the gym than em threes that was one of my biggest gripes with the EM threes they not water resistant so you could take a chance win them to the gym if you want if they get wet you asked out but more importantly they just didn't fit right I think that they're not too comfortable to work that in and he's got your little wing tips it's an extra solve that problem let's see what else you get now this is gonna be your charging case okay so knee Brandon on the top USB type-c charging I like that see what else you get now I know that's usual books and plucking the fallen this is gonna be your USB type-c charging cable now again I hate these small little cables but it is what it is you get some different size wingtips and some different size earbuds play with those get the right fit got some more usual books and and your 360 degree reality audio music freeze trial plug it in follow all right now for just size comparison let's grab the m3s that's what I was talking about you see what the entries there's no wing or knees and these have that oval that oval shape so now with the 800 ends you got the wing on the back so that's gonna lock into your ear so when you're doing your back flips in the gym they're not gonna fall out alright so let me pause the video I'll grab our phone we're pair these up matter of fact let's all drop these in the case first get this initial charge going on started gonna look just like that alright so let me grab a phone we're pair these up and we'll start our usual testing talk amongst yourselves alright Jos will be back in now before we start our usual testing guess who showed up for work late what great ladies and gentlemen white shoes is back in the building white shoes calm down alright so the first thing we want to test is the magnets in the charging case so I'm gonna start off with minimum shaking okay no movement let's increase the intermediate shake edge okay a little bit of movement maximum shake egde rah rah rah rah okay so these are the five intermediate shake äj-- so basically the magnets are pretty strong alright so the first thing you want to do is pair up your headphones now once you take them out the case they'll automatically be in bluetooth pairing mode go to your phone's bluetooth menu and select the 800 ends the next thing you want to do is download the Sony headphones app now once you open this up and connect to your phones this will give you full access to all of the features so let's run through those real quick got the name of the headphones you got your battery percentage for the left the right and the case you got a power button so you can turn them on and off and you got your tutorial your version notifications and information you can launch your music control center about and help now this is the status tab so if you want you can have adaptive sound control on or off now if you turn that on basically what that does is right now I'm sitting in a quiet environment if I happen to walk outside and I have adaptive sound control on it'll automatically turn on noise cancellation then when I get back to where it's quiet it'll automatically turn it off alright so we're gonna leave that off got the song you got playing pause and you got your volume controls next we'll take it over to the sound tab now you can turn on ambient sound control I'm wearing the headphones right now I got Ambika sound sound turned on and I can hear my voice perfectly clear but if you want to you can lower that and have more of your music playing or increase it and have more of your voice you got an equalizer which you can set from speech to manual you got to customs you can turn it off you got bright excited mellow relaxed vocal troubles and my favorite bass boost now you got to 360 degree reality audio setup I'm leave that off because on the side note that only works for certain apps and I don't use those apps now you got to sound quality mode so you can have a priority for sound or priority for stable connection we'll leave a percent take it over the systems now if you want to you can change your touch controls so right now for the left I got ambient sound but if you want to you can have playback volume Google assistant Amazon Alexa or just turn it off got automatic power alright so we'll leave that off we'll leave that on this way save some battery pauses when the headphones turn off leave that on got your notifications automatic download software that's pretty much it alright so now let's talk about the fit and this is what separates these from the Sony entries the fit on these is super comfortable but most importantly they do not move at all so this would be perfect for the gym matter of fact let's do the head shake test I'm gonna start off at minimum shake edge no movement at all let's go to intermediate shake edge okay no movement and now maximum shake egde huh okay almost passed out but they didn't move one inch here's how they're gonna look when you wearing them hide shadow to the corona fro we still growing it no movement at all perfect for the gym now let's do a sound test all right so I got a classic queued up young lover are we going to switch it up today I'm gonna start off with max volume the EQ set the bass boost and noise cancellation turned on alright so one type of playing boys I promise now I'm not gonna sing bird bad hands rub them together let's get it on okay woo for 18 and over Oh for 18 in over no I let's go girl won't you go go home to your mama your mama go home to your papa your Papa you too young to be my lover to be thin it lover Oh you must be 18 in over are you hold up let me let this rock oh my god I hold up once Apple play a pause yeah yeah ladies and gentlemen Sony has done it again all right Sony has done it again these sound incredible if you heard this only em threes you know what to expect I play with that EQ for yourself but when the bass dropped on knees and I haven't even tried my official music yet these sound incredible all right now let me test out a few different songs and we'll get back in alright now I just tested these out with a bunch of different songs from a bunch of different artists and I got to be honest with y'all on a scale of 1 to 10 the Sony WF SP 800 ends our major major major go and at 200 bucks as Bob Barker would say the price is right now I've been searching for the longest to find a set of headphones that could take the place on my power beats pros at the gym ladies and gentlemen I just found them not only do these stay in my ears just like the power beats now you see the power beats got that wing these have the wing they're not gonna move around in your ears but you got digital noise cancellation you've got a fully functional app and these sound better and I'm keeping a rebel child these sound incredible it's over for the power beats pros let's do the rest of our testing all right so first let's do the reconnection test how long did it take to reconnect to your phone after you take them off and put them in a charging case alright so I got the music playing let's take these out drop them in the case close them up fully disconnect it take them back out one one thousand two one thousand three one thousand four one thousand just connected so between four and five 1000 that's pretty good alright so now let's do the one ear bud chest can you play music from one ear bud while the other one is charging up in the case let's hit play okay so I'm going to take out the right side drop it in the case close it up let's hit play okay the left side of still playing let's put the right side back in wait for it to reconnect ok just reconnect it now I'm going to take the left side out drop it in the case let's hit play the right side is still playing ladies and gentlemen you could play music from either earbud while the other one is charging in the case that's a win alright so now let's do the range test I'm gonna walk all the way to 50 feet and let's see if there's any drop connection I said let's hit playing the music alright we start walking forty feet [Music] I'm coming back in five all right let's hit pause okay so I walk all the way to 50 feet no drop connection at all all right so now let's check the touch controls one tap on the right side for playing pause okay no problems with that double tap to skip to the next song okay that's fine triple tap to reverse okay that works and long press for your voice assistant what's the weather for tomorrow okay no problems are dead now for the left ear bud one tap to turn on noise cancellation okay now that does have a voice prompt now another tap to turn on ambient sound mode okay now I'm in ambient sound mode my voice is crystal clear I can hear everything around me and if you've long press on the left ear bud that's quick attention mode so say you got your music on and you just wanna have a quick conversation without turning on ambient sound mode just press it and hold it and I'll mute your music and increase your voice so all that a touch controls work alright so now let's check for lag latency and what I mean by that is when watching a video is there any delay from the person's lips to what you hear okay no delay at all so this would be perfect for watching your videos perfectly watching your movies alright so now let's check the call quality all right of course I'm download Amaya it's ringing out of both is your yo your voice sounds mad loud how do I sound sounds clear this sounds the best that I've ever sounded even better than my ear pods guess what headphones I'm using guess what headphones I'm using right now these new ones called the air power threes they made a today they never even came out yet now I'm just kidding I'm just kidding I know I know I know you use getting my height the fake joint set the flare pods oh my chill chill don't blow me up man I got a few fakes on deck though yeah I got I got a set with your name on it though I know I know what what you doing oh you got a barbecue what's up with the soap with some of the social distancing yeah well I'm saying if y'all don't care no morning what's up I'm coming to let me get a hot dog yo what up let me get a burger you know if nobody don't care no more let me get a plate that's all I'm saying yeah if coronavirus is going I wanna play I know I'm a fat ass uh-oh let me call you back in the midnight let me wrap this up I'm gonna call you back if I gotta tell you I gotta tell you some some juicy T alright alright good bye all right now yo I gotta say one thing the volume on knees you know the volume is mad loud this is one time I might have to turn these down talking on the phone with these the volume was super loud and clear so I like these I'm definitely feeling these we're talking on the phone all right so now let me answer those three questions number one are these worth 200 bucks and the answer is yes not only yes hell yes worth every penny number two how did he's ranked against the Sony M well in terms of sound quality they pretty much sound the same but when it comes to noise cancellation the M theories cancel out more noise so if you're looking for a set that's gonna cancel the most amount of noise you got to go with the M threes the noise cancellation is a little bit better but sound quality wise as far as music they pretty much sound the same and ambient sound mode pretty much sounds the same and number three where do these drink at and my top three truly wireless earbuds with noise cancellation and as of right now they didn't make the cut number one on my list and still assign houses all right these cancels out a lot of noise but they sound incredible number two sony m threes cancel out a lot of noise they sound incredible at number three and pop pros now you can say whatever you want about the air pods these cancel out a lot of noise and they sound incredible let's wrap this up alright so overall on a scale of one to ten the Sony WF SP 800 aims are a major major major go and like I said for 200 bucks the price is right I'm definitely sold on these the fit is excellent so now you could rock these to the gym they not gonna fall out plus the ip55 sweat and water resistant you got nine hours worth of battery on a single charge plus nine hours with the case and quick charge ten minutes of charge will give you one hour at the play time that's pretty dope the ambient sound mode works perfectly as far as noise cancellation it does cancel out a lot of noise not the best on the market but it does work out you are getting noise cancellation your music is gonna sound great no lag when you watching the videos you can use these one at a time while the other one is charging up in the case so that's gonna double your battery life the phone call sounded pretty good and super loud but most importantly the sound quality on these is gonna blow you away trust me when I tell you make sure you download the app and play with the EQ settings for yourself the EQ is the game changer on these I trust me these sound incredible anyway hit me up in the comments let me know what I think

Marathon now that I've run a marathon when I proposed to Amelia anyways that's not why we're here although it's partially why we're here we're gonna talk about the best headphones in earbuds for running so I haven't done this video I don't think in a long time if ever but I've obviously tested so many different pairs of headphones and earbuds out there true Wireless regular Wireless this brand that brand that I have a good idea of what my opinion is for what are the best ones like obviously you're buying one so which one should you get now if you enjoy the video in your new smash that thumbs up button run all over that thumbs up button you see what I there we money yeah that's right okay subscribe let's get to it [Music] all right so what makes headphones good for running well there's a couple of things right so the first thing is probably just comfort you're gonna be using them for extended period of time probably 30 minutes to like a couple hours so you want them to be really comfortable now that is subjective but you know I've tried out so many that I think I have a good idea of what's gonna work for most people out there so comfort is one thing the other thing is a secure fit so you don't want them bobbling around you you want to secure fit to where you never feel like they're gonna pop out or work their way out of your ears so just as an example I tried out what I they be the SOL Republic amps air 2 and I love those true wireless earbuds like they're some of my favorite they have amazing audio quality but they don't do a great job of locking in your ear so over time they work their way out you don't want that with running headphones you also want a good cable management system so if you don't get true Wireless you don't want that cable hanging around all over the place you want some sort of cinch or cord or some sort of ability to make that cable a non-factor you've want probably pretty good audio quality although I think that's of lesser importance because most of them are pretty passable one thing that I think a lot of people overlook is clicky and tactile buttons I can't tell you how many pairs of headphones and earbuds I've tried out that have like touch capacitive buttons and they might be fine for at the office but when you're running you need something that when your fingers are sweaty and you're on the fly you can easily make those adjustments to volume track management pause play etc they have to have a decent microphone for if you're gonna take halls and they have to have some sort of waterproofing rating they're not to be ipx7 certified so they don't need to be completely waterproof but you don't want them to break if you sweat a lot you also want a decent Bluetooth connection now if you don't have a good Bluetooth connection you're gonna get all sorts of crinkles and cracks and interferences with a signal I know that used to happen to me a lot like years and years ago if you have that with your current earbuds that's a sign you may want to upgrade because if like little body parts if an arm gets in the way and it cuts out the signal that is not gonna be tolerable so just a couple of things obviously a ton of headphones check that and and fit that bill these are my three favorites let's start off with what I would consider the overall true Wireless and this probably comes as no surprise because I've covered them a lot on this channel they are the Jabra Ally active 65 T's so I love the standard 65 T comfortable fit really nice design they have an adjustable EQ settings within the mobile app they even have something now I would consider an x-factor feature so great sound isolation passive sound isolation I made that mistake in the past passive sound isolation but they have a here through setting that allows in sound from around you so if you're running in an urban environment or just anywhere that you want to be able to hear things around you that's something that you may utilize and a lot of earbuds don't have a hear through settings so I really appreciate that about 65 T's they also have solid battery life so five hours on a single charge pretty good considering the size of these true wireless earbuds and then an extra 10 hours in the charged case if you're running a marathon 5 hours should be probably long enough for you I think most people will be good with the battery life and if you factor in the case is good as well now they are also IP 56 certified which is water and sweat resistant but you you can't submerge them I don't think you have any problems with the waterproofing if I could only choose one true wireless earbuds for running I would probably go with the 65 t just a solid secure fit and they check a heck of a lot of boxes now an alternative to them would be the J lab epic air elite so they had the J lab epic airs which I liked but the epic air elite are much better they have a very secure fit the only thing I don't like and the reason they didn't make the list is I don't love their touch capacitive sensors but there are a nice alternative of the 65 T's now my budget pick I think are gonna surprise some people so I've kind of in the last like couple of weeks been on a quest to find are there any good cheap wireless earbuds that would be good for running the short answer is there are some not many there's a ton of knockoff headphones on Amazon as you probably know and I settled upon the elects comm I think they're just called the Bluetooth earbuds I don't even know if they have a model number now I've seen probably twenty other pairs of earbuds that look exactly identical to these I mean completely almost exactly the same buttons everything but what I appreciate about these is a couple of things number one the price is really low like $20 or under typically that's a little bit more affordable than the other ones and I've noticed that their buttons are somehow a little bit more clicky so the volume buttons on the top SS track management buttons and they're very clicky and tactile they have a nice pause play button on the side but most importantly a very very very secure fit they almost fit like the the Beats powerbeats 3 but maybe just slightly less secure and a way more affordable they also are ipx7 certified a submergible down to a meter for a minute a couple of things I don't like though one is the microphone is a little far away from your mouth because it's built-in so when you go to talk on the phone it's not gonna be your favorite but I think that is actually a little bit better than having the remote in line because then there's a symmetry then the cable isn't heavier on one side than as the other and they come with the cinch which I know isn't a big deal but they do a really good job of kind of keeping that cable out of your way you can either wear them you know down you're tucking down your shirt this way or down the back I think for 20 dollars they're probably the best budget headphones that you can get for running now me personally my favorite running earbuds if I could only have one would be the j-bird X threes now I know I sound like a broken record because subscribers I mean I've been using these for out probably going on three years I love them they're affordable they come with foam ear tips so they have great sound isolation in a very comfortable fit and you can wear them in two ways right under ear or you can wrap them around your ear and almost get like a true wireless experience that's part of the reason I selected them because the cable is completely out of your way and it dangles I guess against the the back of your head here and that means that you don't even notice it's there it's almost like using true wireless earbuds but you still have the remote that you can use and they're a lot more affordable and they are water and sweat resistant and you can adjust the EQ settings within that j-bert app you want more bass you can do that you want more mids you like listening in a classical or country music or something you can make that adjustment within the j-bert app I just I don't know I've tested so many types of earbuds I just keep gravitating to these because they are so versatile and they do so many things for you and now that they're a little bit older they're really really affordable now a newer alternative to the X 3s and the ones that I find myself using the second most would be the j-bird Terra Pro Soutar Pro a little bit more expensive I think they're like 160 bucks right in around there and they don't completely eliminate the cable but they have a pretty good system they come with a braided cable the one thing that I really like about them though is they have this switch fit system so you can rotate the actual earbuds themselves to more quickly switch from under ear to around the ear and so if you want new running earbuds ones that came out recently I'd go probably with the Terra Pro I'm such a value hunter though I think I would probably just stick with the X 3s I love them I mean I I love the tarah pro 2 I just maybe gravitate more towards the x3 so I'll link all of these in the description and one thing I forgot to mention is our website and mobile app so for anybody that's new we look for deals every single day we have a full time person that does this and they find amazing deals on jaybird bose JBL pretty much any big name brand you know about and they post about it on our website and our free iOS and Android mobile app so that's linked in the description I hope the video was helpful and you got something out of it this is kind of like a culmination of like all the research all the testing that I've done over years like these are the best ones for running let me know what you think write us down below in the comments have a great day [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

50,2020-10-07 10:22:45.937211, hello guys in today's video we're going to check out the top 5 best budget wireless headphones in 2019 I made this list based on my personal opinion and I try to list them based on their price quality durability and more to find out more information about these budget wireless headphones you can check out the description below if you'd like to win one of these products make sure you watch the whole video click the like button and comment the hidden word found in this video at number 5 it's the jab remove shopping on a budget is pretty hard because of lacking funds well simply being frugal is hard because most of the tech pieces these days can be quite expensive however with just a bit of research on the value of the product you can get plenty of options especially in the wireless headphone market one of the most notable options comes from the Danish manufacturer Jabra the move is a perfect pair of wireless headphones for the outdoorsy with their excellent design lightweight body great sound decent battery life and seamless connectivity Joe Burrus quality is also playing a part and you won't have to worry about that the Jabra move sport a pretty interesting and attractive design that's excellent for sports but not just that it has a pretty minimalistic that I catch in design with it's mesh fabric headband that's dust resistant perforated and padded making it comfortable the whole device weighs just 150 grams which is excellent despite having stainless steel construction that connects the headband and ear cups it offers plenty durability and flexibility at the same time the device is available in multiple paint jobs such as navy black beige cobalt blue and red all of them are ultra gorgeous and you can choose the one that suits your style foremost there's no dedicated ear cup for each ear and it doesn't affect the sound performance just the controls will be switched here at the site all the controls are on the ear cups there's a power switch that acts as a Bluetooth button and the microUSB port for charging on the other side you'll spot the 3.5 millimeter audio port for passive use and a bunch of playback buttons that are essential and are extremely intuitive the jab remove isn't just a pretty face they deliver plenty of performance from their price point too the county has equipped this headset with a DSP that delivers appropriate bass response clear mids and sharp highs which was surprising to see in the budget scene to get the best sound though you need to get a perfect seal as the sound leakage is a large issue with the move the battery life is pretty adequate of eight hours of playback time a Bluetooth 4.0 delivers excellent connectivity even an extended range the best pair of budget headphones for active people at number four it's the empower Oh 59 if you want a pair of very cheap headphones you would guess that you have to sacrifice a lot and in the majority of cases that would be true except in the empower Oh 59 these headphones are affordable the most affordable in this budget list but they deliver plenty of qualities to make them disabled or at least capable of functioning as a good pair of wireless headphones they deliver a solid and comfortable fit good quality build interesting design strong connectivity and loud sound in the budget package if you look closely at the design of the empower 5:9 you'll notice that they resemble the beats by dr. dre headphones with a teardrop shape outer part that connects the ear cups to the headband they come available in multiple paint jobs like black and red black deep black and green black and gray black and blue light silver pink and rose gold all of which look excellent and deliver some flashy aesthetics when you take them in your hand please don't feel like a quality pair of headphones however they'll do a great job of hanging around for years to come weighing just under 11 ounces these headphones are incredibly light making them a pleasure to use they also use faux leather to cover the ear pads that are paneled with memory foam to deliver comfort not the best leather and memory foam in the market but they provide some nice comfort the headband is also pretty comfortable thanks to its slight memory foam padding and a faux leather cladding the controls are pretty impressive as they're located on the right ear cap which consists of the playback controls power button which is also the pairing button and the volume buttons thanks to its 4.1 Bluetooth connectivity you get a seamless connection and it delivers a pretty long range of about 30 feet without any lag or corruption the sound quality is made possible thanks to the pair of 14 millimeter drivers that are located on each ear cup which can get pretty loud but don't expect the best sound quality then again for their price the sound performance was pretty good with emphasized bass decent mids just decent combined with the excellent battery life of 20 hours the M power Oh 5 9 is a dream come true for the budget buyers at number 3 it's the JBL t 450 bt if you want to find something in the middle of the budget range i'd suggest the JBL t 450 bt we always expect good quality and sound performance from a tried and proven company like JBL and these are no disappointment they're extremely affordable and deliver plenty of value for their price like decent sound easy-to-use controls and excellent connectivity to complete the package the JBL T 450 BTS have a very interesting but understated and compact design at the same time and I'm quite pleased with it they come in three paint jobs that make it suitable for everybody black blue and white while I would recommend the black and blue versions for commuters the blue model is perfect for the gym or for your morning run thanks to its predominant plastic build these headphones are very light and the plastic looks pretty good however they feel a little flimsy to the touch there's no padding on the headband but there is plenty on the ear cups making these on ear headphones very comfortable however for users that want to use them for longer periods of time the lack of pounding on the headband may cause some problems the controls of the headset are very basic and utilitarian but they get the job done and it's worth mentioning that they're located on the right ear cap the wireless connectivity of these headphones is excellent as they pair instantly with your device and a connection stay strong up to 33 feet of distance they're equipped with Bluetooth 4.0 technology for the purpose and the battery life is good enough at 11 hours and it takes about three hours to recharge them which is not ideal the sound performance of the JBL T 450 BT is pretty standard JBL with dominant bass and balanced mids the treble is good but lacks some liveliness overall I can say that these have some quality sound but balanced and they can get pretty loud with these headphones JBL house delivered a solid option for budget buyers at number two it's the taotronics bh o full row the chinese brand tout Ronix has delivered some interesting headphones in the last few years although the meaning hits in the budget range are safe delivered plenty of desirable qualities and features without asking for a high price the taotronics ph o 4 o is one of their most notable models delivering excellent wireless performance noise canceling technology great sound comfort and looks all in an affordable package let's look at what else these headphones have to offer the company has made quite a name for itself with its premium looking designs and the ph o full row is no different it adopts the looks of high-end headphones like the sony wh 1000 x m3 or the post quiet comfort 35 3 which most of the users prefer they look quite good to be honest and don't look cheap at all the aluminium ring on the outer part of the ear cups just enhances its premium claim they're pretty thickly padded on the ear cups and on the headband delivering excellent comfort and are very lightweight for their size the clamping force is perfect as well to round off the package the controls are pretty intuitively placed and they deliver plenty of quality as well they consist of the basic playback buttons power button volume buttons and the anc control button this particular model is equipped to the wide range of features like the integrated microphone that allows you to take high quality calls the pairing is made possible by the Bluetooth 4.0 technology and it's very stable the ANC is very good as well doing a good job of blocking outside noise but not superb and the battery life is excellent at about 30 hours with the ANC off despite being a budget pair of headphones the taotronics bh0 road delivers great quality sound that's pretty warm and pleasant to listen to while they won't please an audiophile they'll deliver a good musical experience with no harshness in the highs and no overpowering bass the mids were pretty clear and balanced and overall you can listen to them without any problem at number one it's the tribe it x3 tune the tribe it x3 tune is an excellent of headphones and they're definitely the best pair of budget wireless headphones in the market for a variety of reasons they boast an excellent design good build quality amazing comfort levels great wireless performance and best of all they have great sound quality that can compete with more expensive headphones like most of the budget headphones in the market the tribe it x3 tune rocks are pretty basic and utilitarian design but it does it so well it has an all-black design with the ear cups attached to the plastic headband and unlike most budget headphones they fold inwards for convenient storage in the included storage case which impressed me the headband has a pretty good feeling to it and it had some cushioning for comfort the ear cups are decorated with a grill giving them an open end look and they have the Tri bit logo on them as well on the left ear camp you'll find the 3.5 millimeter audio port for passive use and on the right hand side the power button volume controls playback controls and the microUSB port for charging the comfort levels on the Tri bit ex-free tune are pretty excellent as the faux leather ear cups have plenty of cushioning in them perfect for office use and long listening sessions however due to their excellent seal they weren't breathable enough the wireless connection is pretty much perfect and strong and whole device was very easy to use and control the sound quality of these headphones is amazing considering their price with a pretty warmer soundscape that was pleasing however if you're used to listening from high fidelity headphones you'll find these lacking the pair of 40 millimeter drivers deliver plenty of clarity in the mids the treble was pretty aggressive but not annoying and the bass was warm but punchy the perfect pair of budget wireless headphones you can't get any better than this thanks for watching I hope you liked the video if you found it helpful please remember to leave a like and

today's video we're gonna check out the best wireless headphones in 2019 I made this list based on my personal opinion and are trying to list them based on their price quality durability and more to find out more information about these wireless headphones you can check out the description below if you'd like to win one of these products make sure you watch the whole video click the like button and comment the hidden word found in this video at number 5 it's the Sennheiser PXE 550 the German audio manufacturing giant Sennheiser is known for its high fidelity headphones that have set industry standards for many years their interpretation of the wireless headphone dedicated for travellers and commuters with its excellent active noise cancellation the Sennheiser px II 550 has been near-perfect it has the trademark Sennheiser sound quality and tons of other features and its premium price but it's all worth it for this great wireless headset the county's earlier efforts to make a wireless noise cancelling headphone have been a disaster but with the PSC 550 things have changed design-wise these headphones have adopted a simpler and more streamlined look compared to its predecessors with the buttons having a softer look and not catching attention the ear cups have an oval shape which is a little strange but they sit comfortably around your ears with great comfort speaking about comfort the Sennheiser pxc 550 delivers with an inch thick padding on the ear caps covered with a soft faux breathable leather which provides much needed comfort for commuters and travelers that have long flights the active noise cancellation on these headphones is very refined with three modes one is full noise cancellation the second is off and the third is the one that adapts the ambient noise giving you the appropriate level for your surroundings from the cap tune smartphone app you can set your own custom sound profiles complete with EQ DSP effects and levels of a and C another interesting feature of these was the touch sensitive right ear cup that are some interesting commands and controls for playback and cool the sound performance of the PXE 550 was just perfect excellently balanced with a dose of fun rather than the complete clean analytical sound of the normal Sennheiser's the soundstage was exceptionally big despite being closed back wireless headphones these were amazing and one of the best for listening to music I noticed it had a perfect performance with every genre Anna was quite impressed with its performance with movies and podcasts what are the best headphones for frequent travelers and commuters at number four it's the Bose QuietComfort 35 - the Bose QuietComfort 35 - is one of the best wireless headphones in the market for quite some years now it's not surprising as to why this product is so popular because it's the most comfortable headset on the market as its name implies and with great our seeming style amazing sound great connectivity and one of the best noise cancelling features it's a catch design-wise bose has chosen their really simple and utilitarian design for the quiet comfort 35 to that we've come to know from the company for years now I could say that the headphones have a pretty neutral design and they're appropriate for any setting that anyone can wear them comfortably they have an all plastic build without any flash or striking details and one might assume that the quality is below par but these will take plenty of beating before giving up thanks to the quality and sturdy construction they wages 234 grams which is very surprising for the size and Wireless nature and they're the lightest premium wireless model and the most comfortable pair of headphones that I've ever put around my ears with a perfect clamping force and plush padding the active noise cancellation is one of the best in the market as well and now you can adjust it via the smartphone app to low full or completely off the battery life of these headphones is about 20 hours with the noise cancellation at full and on top of that the features consist of the Google assistance which has its dedicated button and works excellently unlike other headphones the post QuietComfort 35 2 s anc works perfectly and consistently at tuning down engine and crowd noises but it's not as capable with high-frequency noises the sound performance of the Bose QuietComfort 35 2 is amazing delivering a wide soundstage that was surprising considering it's closed back I like the base which was adequate unlike other boats models with overpowering bases the mids were clean and detailed and highs were sharp enough I would describe the sound as warm and smooth adequate for the masses at number three it's the v-moda crossfade to the v-moda crossfade to may not be as famous as other names on this list but once you try them there's no going back delivering amazing high-quality wireless headphones and the definite best sound that you'll find in this category it sports a decent battery life and the best wireless connectivity that you can find and on top of that they have an interesting design durable and quality build that will last you a lifetime so let's take a closer look at this headset if you've seen its predecessor you would instantly recognize that it's a V mode a headset as it rocks the same iconic design with a few changes it is slightly smaller ear cups than its predecessors but the fit is exceptionally good and aesthetically these look amazing unfortunately they aren't as comfortable as the aforementioned bose which are industry leaders in that area but they're not far behind they're equipped with nice memory foam and I could comfortably use them as my go-to headphone on top of all this if you go to the manufacturers website you can customize them to your liking to suit your style and taste one of the biggest selling points of these headphones is the new apt X Bluetooth support which is the highest quality streaming codec you can get the battery life of the v-moda Crossway - is a little behind its competitors rated and about 14 hours between charges but these are not exactly commuter or traveller headphones in the package you get a nice semi hard carrying case and a stylish orange cable for Wired use when your battery runs out the motor was a brand that was known for its overpowering bass head style soundscape however the crossfade twos are balanced and natural perfect for every genre they can deliver some punchy low and sub-base when it's needed though I was particularly impressed with their amazing soundstage which was three dimensional and their textured and detailed mid-range overall the sound is extremely rich and detailed and it boasts amazing near analytical clarity if you want the best sound and connectivity you'd be hard-pressed to go against the crossfade to at number two it's the Beats Studio three Beats headphones are one of the most iconic and most popular pieces of tech accessories you may see since their introduction they've amassed a huge following fanbase and since then it's been an absolute craze first owned by monster now they're an Apple subsidiary but they still keep their own identity and breathtaking design especially the studio three apart from that they are extremely comfortable great sound noise cancellation and they fit right in with the iPhone users despite being owned by Apple the Beats Studio 3 has not opted for the minimalistic and streamlined trademark Apple design they've gone with our iconic street style design that's given them their fame they're a little sleeker and more refined than the original beats produced by monster with an all plastic build and the pizza logo on each ear cap you can get these headphones in different colors porcelain rose shadow gray blue white and my personal favorite matte black which has some urban stealthy look to it the company has marketed the Beats Studio 3 is one of the most comfortable in the market and they don't disappoint that's mostly due to the lightweight plastic construction but the foam ear cushions that are large and fit every head size do their part as well in terms of features the Beats Studio 3 doesn't have tons of them or any fancy new tech however it does the basics exceptionally well it's equipped with a fast fuel technology that provides 3 hours of playback time in about 10 minutes of charging perfect for commuters that are always in a rush it's equipped with Apple's w1 chip that delivers about 22 hours of playback time with the active noise-cancelling on however it achieves this only with Apple devices it manages about half of that with Android devices with a great soundscape designed for the masses great battery life and perfect performance for Apple users the Beats Studio 3 is one of the best headphones in the market and that number one it's the Sony WH 1000x m3 first off I want to say that no other headphone can achieve the excellence of the Sony WH 1000x m3 and I don't see it happening for at least a few years it improves on its already excellent predecessor with some design touches and enhanced technologies it the best combination of features that are very cleverly implemented such as the delicious sound and perfect noise cancellation for starters the Sony WH 1000 X m3 has not changed a lot from its predecessor but some slight tweaks make it a masterpiece you can get it in one of two tasteful color schemes the dark black and the platinum silver one of the biggest improvements comes to the headband which bends naturally and gives a closer fit looking professional and streamlined on your head the comfort is top of the class as well and you can wear these for hours without feeling any kind of strain these headphones sport Sony's HD noise canceling processor qn1 that manages to block mid and high frequency sounds that other manufacturers with pay NC lack the QN one also improves the audio performance of the device by handling 32-bit signal processing the battery life of these headphones is about 30 hours even with the NC activated and it's quick charge feature is perfect delivering five hours of play time in just 10 minutes of charging I was extremely impressed with the touch sensitive right ear camp which was pretty responsive accurate and easy to learn its coolest feature was the quick attention mode when you hold your palm over the ear cup and music and noise cancelling is turned off to listen to outside noises the clean and refined sound of these headphones comes from the analog amplifier delivering excellent instrumentals and vocals with a punchy and aggressive low range clear and neutral mids and sharply detailed highs you can switch from genre to genre and still get a perfect experience providing the best noise cancellation and increased comfort with high quality sound it'll become your best friend excelling in every category these are the best headphones that money can buy in 2019 thanks for watching I hope you liked the video if you found it helpful please remember to leave a like and subscribe to my channel to see more videos like this in the future if you have

all right calm down calm down oh yeah every for yourself let's see the play and pause button works alright playing pause works cool I was getting a little workout just now on a scale of 1 to 10 I'm definitely feeling these so far now I gotta take them to the gym and put them to the test we're gonna test that out talk through technology when people try to talk to you see if you could talk without taking the headphones off we're gonna try all that stuff out ice I'll be back I'm gonna run to the gym before they close talk amongst yourselves all right Joss we'll be back in now just came back from the gym I did a full savage workout and I'm ready to let y'all know what I think about these headphones on a scale of 1 to 10 these are a major major major go I'm feeling these headphones and they're definitely my new favorites for the gym now up until today I've been cycling through three sets of over-the-air headphones at the gym have my sole joints y'all remember these had the SMS headphones and another set of soul headphones now all the radius headphones have something in common with the project rock editions that's the sweat proof air cups that's the main difference between regular headphones and gym headphones sweat proof air cups you can take any set of headphones and rock them in the gym but you're gonna have problems with the sweat perfect example my skull candy crush your wireless now I rock these in the gym when I'm doing heavy weights but the main problem with these if I rock them today and I'm gonna go to the gym tomorrow when I pull them out my bag they still gonna be moist and wet and slimy and I don't know about you but there's nothing worse than pulling your headphones out the bag and they still wet from the previous workout that's pretty disgusting and I don't flow like that now there's 10 things that I want to cover with the project Rock additions so let's break it down number one the price 250 bucks The Price is Right that's right on Paul with all the other gym headphones but these sounds incredible now if I had to compare the sound against these three sets of headphones it's no contest these are official JBL headphones you've got a lot of bass nice and crystal clear sound I'm not gonna complain about the price at all number two the look how do these headphones look they definitely look like a set of gym headphones now when you up in the gym you don't want sleek stylish space-age headphones you want some rugged manly looking headphones look at these you got that Texas Longhorns symbol on it a bow these just look rugged they feel rugged beautiful look on these I these are real man headphones let me show you what they look like on head now I was up in the gym I took a few snapshots I said that's what you don't look like when you're rocking them and this is me rocking them down the side note sun's out guns out let's go all right let's keep it moving number three build quality now these are plastic built headphones right so nothing to write home about but they feel good they don't feel like cheap plastic they feel nice and lightweight now let me tell you something when I was rocking these headphones another difference between regular headphones and gym headphones is the grip these have a nice set of grip on these ear cups now if you're doing bench press this happens to me all the time when I'm rocking my school candy crush your wireless if you don't have this kind of spongy grip to it once you start sweating these headphones move around on your head so when you're laying flat on the bench you're gonna have to put the headphones up like this otherwise soon as you start benching they start slipping off and sliding backwards now I was doing heavy chest bench press today these didn't move at all I didn't have to adjust them up like this I left them regular and they stayed still so I'm definitely feeling it alright so build quality a 1 number for the field how do they feel are they comfortable or not these are super lightweight I rock them the whole time I was in the gym I didn't have to adjust my ears fellas if you rock an ear ring they're not gonna press against your earring it's not gonna hurt at all nice and light weight no complaints with debt number five battery life now I'm gonna have to get back to y'all maybe in a couple of days when I do a what's in my gym bag but if these work as they advertised 16 hours worth of battery life that's a major go all right you're not working out 16 hours a week and 5 minute charge give you one hour worth of battery life that's a go I but we'll get back to that but like I said if it works as advertised nothing complain about number 6 phone calls now I tested this out when I was up in the gym I had to call the 24-hour diner and see what time they closed I'm up in the gym it's a lot of background noise I heard the person crystal clear they heard me phone calls on this as ago so if you're rocking these headphones and you get a phone call you're not gonna have to take them off and switch or take them off and hold the phone in your hand and have all that sweat going on your phone just leave them on answer the phone call number 7 talk through technology now on the low that might be the best feature of these headphones and that's another reason why I said it worth the price talk through technology now let me show you how that works now when I was unboxing it I didn't even notice that this is an actual button right here you got a little click on it so basically when you're in the gym and you're listening to music and somebody comes and taps you on the shoulder and you want to start up a little conversation you don't have to take your headphones off once you press that button basically it's not gonna mute the song but the song is basically just gonna fade away you hear it a little bit and you're gonna hear these noise-canceling mics open up so it sounds like it's amplifying the sound it's hard to explain that over video you don't have to put these on here and for yourself when I test them testing them out a couple of times I took the red one plus with me to the gym and I know a lot of people is gonna ask me to see it so I kept taking it out you know flashing it and people kept coming up to me I was having conversations pressing the button and everybody knew I was testing these headphones so I was like talk to me and people are talking to me I'd have to take them off at all my gym is super noisy the music is mad loud I was having regular conversations so to talk through technology that might be the best feature of these headphones number eight wired connection now you use these wired it sounds pretty much exactly the same but the good thing is even if your battery's dead you can plug in the wire and still use the headphone now certain headphones I'm not gonna name any names but certain headphones if the battery is completely dead you can't use them beats excuse me something in the to these you can rock them with dead battery all right so you forget to charge them up you get to the gym your workout is not done just plug them in unless you got an iPhone you better have that dongle on deck next the case alright this is number nine the case this case is dope it's a hardshell case if you notice ass holes in the top it's ventilated alright so basically what that means is once you finish working out and you sweating all over the place you put your headphones back in the case they're gonna be able to drive because they have ventilation in it now usually what I do is if I sweat too much I'll just leave these out all of my other headphones basically the same thing you just leave them out three hours later they'll be dry so by the time it's your next workout you're not gonna have to worry about that last but not least number ten the sound how do these headphones sound and they sound amazing now not as much base as the Skullcandy crutches of course not you really can't find headphones with this kind of bass because this is hectic feedback bass so these are the headphones that I use when I'm doing my heavy super heavy chest days and I need that extra bass pounding in my head then I rock these but the head the bass are nice it sounds great it's nice and punchy no distortion the mids the highs everything is there they sound exactly like a set of JBL speakers and if you don't believe me check this out this how you know it's JBL watch or not turn it on put the headphones about a month watch I turn it on you hear that sound that's the same sound when you turn on your JBL extreme or your JBL charge three that parent sound everything is the same JBL quality sound no complaints they're nice and loud not like I said my Jim the music is super loud and sometimes it's so loud that it's annoying because if I'm using my Y my truly wireless headphones like the gear headphones or the Jaybirds or the X shocked Souls when I'm using those truly wireless headphones sometimes I can't use them in my gym because the the background music is too loud and they drown out my music so just now you know it's the day before the fourth of July everybody trying to get that free barbecue workout on so my gym was just packed everybody's in there the music is mad loud they got the baseball game on they got the big three basketball game and music going on the same time I had these headphones on I didn't hear nothing also sound quality on these a1 overall like I said on the scale of what a chain these are a major major major go I would definitely recommend getting these for the gym now just in case if you don't remember these souls these are the bike life headphones I just want to talk about these real quick somebody asked me this question let me show you why these are the bike life headphones once you power them up these have the lights now if I click twice these have flashing lights on them now the sound quality on these not the best in the world which is pretty good for riding your bike you don't want your headphones to be too loud when you bike riding I see you messing around a get hit by a car these are my bike life headphones because when I'm rocking them the more lights the better when you ride in that night but these right here the project right conditions these are my certified new gym headphones now maybe about three four days I'm gonna do a what's in my gym bag video I'll give you an update with the battery and if there's anything y'all want me to cover that I didn't cover hit me up in the comments and I get back to y'all shut

Let me make a new one. JBL recently launched a new line of headphones. The JBL LIVE series. These are the JBL LIVE 650BT and the JBL LIVE 500BT. They are in the higher price range and they don't have big price difference. With this review I help you have to choose which one to buy. Before we start I want to ask you to subscribe to my channel and don't forget turn on the notification bubble so you don't miss any future videos on this channel. So the price difference between these headphones is $ 50. These are the most key specs, but why are we paying $ 50 more for the JBL LIVE 650BT? The main answer is active noise cancellation. Active noise canceling takes care of that the noise around you is filtered out so that you can fully enjoy your music. Both headphones are neatly delivered in a sturdy packaging with the same accessories. These accessories are a charging cable with a USB to a micro-USB connection and an AUX cable. This time, JBL has added a braided cable that is usually whole are sturdy, so JBL has earned points here! I currently have the JBL LIVE 500BT in blue and the JBL LIVE 650BT in black, but they are available in more colors. The JBL LIVE 500BT retails for $ 150. For this price you get headphones with good sound quality in this price range. The headphones have a battery life of 30 hours and works with Google Assistant &amp; Amazon Alexa. Another feature is Ambient Aware &amp; Talkthru Technology which makes it possible to transfer your music With one click you can turn it down so you can hear or hear someone next to you better can hear your surroundings. The JBL LIVE 650BT becomes sold for $ 200, For this price you have headphones according to the specifications with better sound quality, but this is not clearly noticeable. The headphones can be used for 20 hours with active noise canceling and without active noise canceling you can do them as much as possible Use for 30 hours. The 650BT also works with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. The 500BT has a headband with soft material in it. While listening I have after a few hours it doesn't bother you, but it does feel pretty hard. The earpads are soft, but they do not form completely to your ears. These headphones can be folded so you can easily take it with you in a bag or a cover, but you can also use a special headphone cover purchase, because this is not included. The lifespan of the headphones is good and that is why it does not break easily. On the left you will find a number of buttons such as the on / off button, the volume the aux connection, the bluetooth button and the button for Ambient Aware &amp; Talkthru Technology. There is only a micro-usb connection on the right to charge the headphones. While they look fairly similar, there are certainly differences in the materials used. The LIVE 650BT's headband feels a lot like it softer and is also a lot thicker. They are a lot more comfortable in the long run. The ear pads also feel better and this shape much more to your ears as if the shape remains in it. The LIVE 650BT is also foldable so you can easily take it with you and here is a headphone cover added. Longevity is great too, when you feel it put to the test which is still robust and sturdy. To the left of the headphones are about it generally the same functions as with the LIVE 500BT. Although with these headphones A button for active noise canceling has been added. At the right there is also a micro-usb connection for charging. So for $ 50 more you get an extra function, more comfort and better based on the specifications sound. But is it worth it? If you are looking for headphones and you are not often on the road or you don't listen for hours on end, then the LIVE 500BT very good headphones for this price. If you're looking for headphones for general use and you are often on the road where a lot ambient noise and you listen for hours on end, then in my opinion the LIVE 650BT is a better option despite the higher price. You then get active noise canceling, more comfort and a little better sound quality. This makes listening to music is a lot more fun and you can last longer. There is headphones for both the sound quality is fine, but if you are a real bass fan I would recommend headphones with a bass boost or extra boost function. If you want headphones that are cheaper, but yes has active noise canceling, check out my others review of the JBL TUNE600BTNC. I put the link in the description or somewhere in the screen. I think ... you can find it. Thanks for looking! Are you going to buy one of these headphones? Or have do you already have one and do you have any questions? Let me know in the comments.

These are the boat rockerz 450 wireless bluetooth headphone.",27,156720,686.0,3196.0,258.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pwel4ZuRkKE/hqdefault.jpg,boat|rockerz|450|nirvana,2020-10-07 10:22:45.937395, hello everyone and welcome to another video so today in this video we will take a look at this wireless headphone and this is the boat rockers 450 I've got this for about 200 rupees during the sale from Amazon dotting so this is how the headphone came in a red colored box and here you can see the boat local box you can see some of the specification or some of the features given here you can see HD sound it comes with bluetooth version 4.0 as you can see on the box adaptive ear-cups the speaker size or the driver size in this red phone is 40 millimeter and the company is claiming about 8 hours of battery time and we will do the test in our usage at the back you can see a picture of circle the one at the side you can see the boat logo gained so without any further delay let me just open it and see what we get in the box and see how it works and how to connect it with a cell phone so easy to open once you get this out you can flip it like this so once you open it you get to see this accessories I will take a look at in a second let me just get the earphone out so you get the air phone out all you have to do is basically take this out and take this wrapper out there we go so let me put all these things back in the box there's nothing in the box left now so let me keep the box aside and let's just focus on our project ok so this is how the earphone look as you can see these are very squishy very soft velvet kind of a texture on the ear cups inside you can see your forty millimeter speaker it is adjustable as you can see both the sides are adjustable and this is the maximum adjustment settings that you get let's compress it together you also get the cushion for the top of your head at the back you can see that it you can fold it without any problem so you can pretty much do like this and it becomes really portable I had to carry to open it all you have to do is bring it outside and then you can use it again without any problem you can see on the both these speakers you get the both local and here is both written as well this finish on the body of the headphone is kind of a matte smooth finish it's not very simply a slippery so this is how pretty much the earphone looks one thing that I am going to complain about this is because there is the buttons on this earphone are very smooth so when you are hearing it when you are wearing it I it's very difficult to differentiate between different buttons yeah sometimes what I was doing was I was kind of clicking here and then here because I was unable to differentiate between the body of the headphone and the buttons so once if you are using more than one earphone headphone then we will find it a little difficult but if you're just using this one your hands will get used to the different buttons so the buttons could have been a little bigger and a little more outside the body one of the good thing about this headphone is that it also has your 3.5 millimeter jack so if you run out of batteries you can power this with the 3.5 millimeter cable that also comes in the box here is your power on LED so this is how pretty much the body and the features on this headphones are it is also a micro USB a charge port so there we go now let's take a look at what we get in the box that is the packet that we caught in the box and let me just open it so inside you will get a manual looks like a 1-year married medic manufacturer warranty card and also there is one pamphlet for different products from the board so let's keep it aside and let's take a look at the charging cable so you get a small not so good quality but decent about one meter or a little less than that micro USB charging cable so that's very common and you will also get a very not so good quality so that this cable is not a very good quality this is very flimsy but this is let me just show you what is the length of the cable okay so the length of the auxiliary cable is about one meter long but this is handy because once you run out of batteries inside your earphone you can plug in this cable and continue listening to your headphones okay so let's keep all the accessories on the side and let's let me show you how you can pair this headphone with the your phone so here you can see that here are three buttons as you can see one is your plus button the other is your pause play button so you can see that the middle button is your pause play button on the top on the best on the very right you will see your plus button and the very right you will see you minus button but now turn on the earphone all you have to do is basically press the middle button for a three four second until you see the LED blinking so let me just press it in as you can see the LED will start blinking now and you will also hear the sound that it is ready to pair so it is not blinking so let me just bring my phone in and show you how to pair it so you can see that there it is not blinking here is my redmi note 7 let me turn it on on your phone go to your Bluetooth setting turn the Bluetooth all in once the bluetooth is on keep press the Bluetooth button and you will see the board rockers 450 as you can see and on the side you can see the LED click on the board records for 50 and it will it will say a pairing and once it is paired press the power button and you will also have that the headphone will say that it is now connected to the boat rockers 450 and you will see the battery percentage and it will say connected so at the moment the battery is about 60% and this is how you can use pretty much anything now let me show you how you can change different setting inside the headphone okay so as you can see I have my one of my youtube videos playing from my youtube playlist now this is how you can control your music or watching videos so there are three buttons the middle button is your pause playback button as you can see at the moment the video is playing to pause the video I will have to press the pause button let me present pause button once and as you can see the music is talk if I play the pause button again the music or the video will is continuous start playing to go to the previous track I will all I will have to do is press the plus button for a couple of second I'm pressing the plus button now and it's changed to the previous video and it will start playing if I want to go to the next track I will press the minus button for a couple of second let me press the minus button and it's switched to the next track and this is how you can control the playing music and the videos when using the headphone now let me show you how you can increase the volume of the earphone to increase the volume there are plus and minus button to increase the volume tapping start tapping the plus button until you hear the headphone say maximum volume so and to decrease the volume all you have to do is press the minus button keep tapping it until you hear the minimum volume so this is how you can control the the music the videos with the headphone with the patterns that are present on the earphone so let me listen to a couple of music tracks and spend some time with this headphone and I will see you after at least two days okay so now I've been using the headphone for about three days now and about three days I have some opinions about this headphone so starting with the audio quality I think the audio quality and the loudness of this headphone was really really good when it comes to the of wearing the it was really really comfortable when you will use it for the first time I think it would be a little tight but after using this for a couple of minutes you will get used to it so when the first day I started using it my ears started hurting after 15 minutes after that I removed the headphone and started using them after 15 minutes and then I was able to put it for longer times so once you get used to it it will be easier for you to wear them so in the audio quality there are three mainly three points the high section the mid section and the base so bass is very very important so the base of this headphone was very very good I really like the bass on this headphone so I think bass is probably the highlight top of this headphone overall now talking about the mid section where you get your dialogues when someone is talking to or the other person or someone is talking to you in the into the camera that comes in at the mid section the mid section is also really really good it is very clear but sometimes a bass is a little overpowering to my taste but again audio is very subjective your preference may vary so again Audio is very very different if I like something it's not necessarily that you will like that too let's talk about the high high section which is the very when you have very sharp notes a very treble the Travel section of this of the headphone is also very very good it's also comparable to the mid section but bass is the highlight of this headphone so times when there's very little volume in the treble at those section of the treble are not easier to listen overall I would give this headphone about 8 out of 10 and with the for the bass I would give this about 9 out of 10 so if I had the money and I wanted to buy this headphone again I would definitely put my money into this I bought this with my own money so this is not a biased review now let's talk about the battery life the company on the box claims that the batteries on this headphone will last you about eight hours in mice testing while listening to the headphone for about at about 60 to 70 percent volume I was able to get more than eight hours somewhere close to 10 hours without any problem the headphone was really really loud so at 60 to 70 percent volume I did not have to increase the volume anymore let's talk about the call quality I only talk to two people through the mic that's that's inside there so you can see that there is a small hole which is your microphone so if you are using the headphone and talking to some other person on the phone the audio was clear but I imagined that in a noisy environment it would be a problem so I can't say anything about the mic just yet I will have to use it a little more but I will let you guys know in the comments after using this for a couple more days okay so let's talk about the battery life the battery levels very very good and the charging time we will do the charging test in a second because I've drained the headphones completely and this is the cable that came in the box this is you can use when the battery of the headphone is completely dead using the wire was much much better not much was better about a little better when using the Bluetooth because wire transmits a very clean signal and the wires are literally a little powerful nothing can beat when you connect something with the pop with the wire so there we go this was my complete review of this boat rockers 450 wireless bluetooth headphones I really like this headphone and I would disc headphones or thumbs up so thank you guys for watching and I will see you guys in my next video if you have any question you can put them in the comments and I will try to answer them as soon as possible by all right then so the batteries of our headphone is completely dead now so let's do the charging test and figure out how long this headphone takes to charge so I've got the manual here and as you can see in the manual the charging time is given about if the camera focuses it's about 3.5 hours to 4.5 hours let's just see how long it takes in my test so I'm using the charger of my redmi note 7 let me just plug that in inside our extension I'm using the cable that came in the package so this is the cable that came in V with the headphone this is about half a meter long a little longer than half a meter long that meters that plug it in for it's in and if you look at the headphone you will see that there is this micro USB charging port and once you plug it in you will see a LED glowing so let me just plug it in so it's plugged in and here you can see LED and here is also your microphone we will talk about the microphone later so let me just plug the extension on you can see the red LED is glowing and the red LED will stop glowing once the batteries are completely charged so let me start a timer and let's measure how long it takes to charge this headphone so I've got my phone here let's start the timer let's see how long it takes to charge okay so as you can see the LED has stopped glowing the red LED err I forgot to check one time but I believe that it it was completely charged in about one hour one hour forty to fifty minutes almost a little less than two hours so this is the charging time of the board rockers 450 [Music]

along with updated prices be sure to check out the description the products mentioned in this video are in no exact order so be sure to stay tuned until the end so you don't miss anything starting our list are the bose noise-canceling headphones are picked for the best noise canceling wireless headphones if you're working in a noisy office or you just want to drowned out the environment around you then you'll want a pair of great noise cancelling headphones and bose has just the right ones priced under $400 their noise cancelling headphones not only reduce outside sounds but they're Wireless as well with a few features tossed in for good measure these wireless headphones feature 11 separate levels of noise cancellation to customize the amount of sound you want to get in and out this feature helps with voice calls by allowing you to adjust the level of noise cancellation so you can isolate your own voice from surrounding noise leading to better concentration it doesn't stop it calls either if you're doing some late night movie watching at high volume and don't want to disturb your family these headphones will keep sound from spilling out and potentially waking them up they can even be paired with a bose sound bar for a little extra convenience the headphones can also handle voice commands from AI assistants like Alexa thanks to a built-in microphone sound wise these Bose headphones offer excellent audio thanks to a wide sound space good bass response and pleasantly surprising clarity this is an excellent plus for a pair of wireless headphones speaking of wireless most noise cancelling headphones are still traditionally wired meaning Bose is offering a very versatile product if you like flexibility in your headsets unfortunately battery life is limited compared to some of its rivals but still relatively robust at around 20 hours of use without needing a recharge for a pair of headphones with stronger battery life check out the sony WH 1000 XM 3s which is coming up next Bose offers a great product with a surprising amount of noise cancellation options for those who want to listen to music movies and other media without any distraction up next is the sony WH 1000 XM 3 our pick for the best overall wireless headphones if you're after a set of balanced best overall wireless headphones it can be really hard to narrow down a winner the sony WH 1000 XM 3's are a solid option for a price under $300 with a lot of features to offer the discerning listener the WH 1000s includes some of the features of the bose wireless headphones previously mentioned in this video including support for AI assistants like Alexa and Google assistant plus noise canceling technology it does offer a few new surprises however one of these is the quick attention mode which allows you to cover the right ear cup and turn down your music without having to fumble for a volume knob or pause button touch controls also let you raise and lower volume change tracks or take calls by tapping the ear phone which is a nice touch since engine technology also listens to the activity around you and automatically tweaks and balances audio even during high altitude flights these headphones are also quite comfortable to wear thanks to their ergonomic design and slim ear cuffs that reduce their overall weight and allows them to be worn for extended periods which is great if you're on a long road trip or an overseas flight one of the best features however is the battery life estimated at around 30 hours on a single charge this is a step up from the Bose noise canceling headphones by an extra 10 hours if that weren't enough a mere 10 minutes of charging time can net an astounding 5 hours of playback which is great if you forgot to charge them up before heading out they don't offer the same level of noise cancelling customization as the Bose headphones nor is call quality is good but these are minor drawbacks to an otherwise excellent set of cans the Sony WH 1000 XM 3 s blend great sound with a host of fantastic features that make them an excellent around contendere next we have the NS series 10 wireless earbuds our pick for the best budget wireless earbuds there are plenty of budget wireless earbuds on the market but finding a standout can be tough which is why the NS series 10 wireless earbuds are such a treat for the discerning audiophile for a price under $50 not only are they convenient but comfortable while providing excellent sound quality for a device at this price range newly released in early 2020 it's quickly becoming one of the top-rated earbuds on the market and it's easy to see why the series 10 wireless earbuds achieve great audio quality through a specially designed double moving coil eight millimeter horn for excellent tonal range and clarity CVC noise cancelling helps to shut the outside world out when all you want to do is immerse yourself fully in your music each earbud can be paired with a different device in case you wish to break up their functionality for the testing of different products these earbuds also feature a microphone for voice calls without the need for a separate microphone or smart phone a simple three light system helps identify the charge level of the left and right earbuds and the charging box so you can keep track of how much juice is left in each I've compared these two my ear pods Pro and although the air pods Pro were better in almost every way they were a lot more similar than you might expect the size of the cases are identical the battery life was not far off they were similar in comfort ability and fit the noise cancellation was much better on the air pods Pro but the sound quality was comparable to the point most non hardcore music lovers will not notice much of a difference considering they cost a fifth of the price of the air pods Pro it's really easy to see there is a lot of liked about them for the price they're very portable provide excellent sound great comfort and a premium feel if you're looking for a budget earbud or just don't care to spend hundreds of extra dollars for a product that you may not use all the features on anyway this is easily a top choice on the market if you're interested in updated pricing on any of the items mentioned in this video be sure to check out the links below prices update on these products almost daily with sales and general price drops so if you want to find the most updated information check the description if you find this video helpful please help out the channel by giving this video a like and tell us which product caught your eye in the comments below up next is the Jabra elite 85h our pick for some great overall wireless headphones unless you're an audiophile who is hip to the latest sonic technology you may find it difficult to decide on a great pair of wireless headphones that sound good and sport great features the Java elite 85h wireless headphones are a surefire contender with a price under 250 dollars they're well-designed feature-rich and sound great with a few pleasant surprises tossed in as well these noise-canceling headphones include smart sound and smart active noise cancellation that work in tandem to automatically cancel out environmental sound if things get too noisy while providing excellent sound and voice call quality this is achieved by utilizing six of the eight built-in microphones to enhance the quality of your phone calls while gating out wind and other distracting noises the 85h also includes a I assistant integration for Alexa Siri and Google assistant voice commands the 85 h's are very warm and balanced out of the box with firm mids and low end base that can be custom tailored within the Jabra sound Plus app for precise eqe there's even a bass boost setting for those who want a bit more Rumble even though the 85 HS can produce a bit of distortion with this setting on at higher volumes battery life is the real star here offering the whopping 36 hours of playback on a single charge which puts it ahead of others on our list like the Sony WH 1000 X m3 although sound quality is fantastic they're not quite up to par with the Sony's however but they are priced more competitively they also lack support for high-end audio codecs like AAC or LD AC which can affect lossless playback however the Jabra Elite 85 h's are well suited for those who simply want a great pair of cans and don't require absolute pitch perfection in their music for this reason there is solid choice for anyone who might be unsure which pair of headphones to pick finally we have the Apple earpods Pro our pick for the best wireless headphones for Apple users if you're active and on the go then traditional headphones can present a major problem that is easily solved by buying a pair of gray earbuds for Apple users the air pods Pro is a top-notch option that eliminates the bulk of headphones for easier portability and convenience for a price under 250 dollars if you're an Apple iPhone user the air pods pro are perfect companions and designed with that particular device in mind they are compatible with the latest gen iPhones and are already tied into the Apple ecosystem for a no-fuss setup the air pods prou offer noise canceling technology that can quickly toggle the transparency mode by long pressing on the stem other touch controls include single squeezing the stem to play music double squeezing to advance to the next track or triple squeezing to skip backward to the previous track this is a relatively simple and straightforward set of touch controls that Apple users will find instantly recognizable and intuitive connection to an Apple device is a very simple affair provided you're on iOS 13 point to a simple prompt allows you to instantly connect with the push of a button for a hassle free set up Android and Windows users shouldn't fret either the air pods pro is fully compatible with both eco systems via a more traditional bluetooth pairing scheme that can have you up and running in no time the only real caveat of the air pods Pro is Apple's insistence on having them charged via lightning cable which may be off-putting to many users who prefer a universal USB C interface also the stem design may not be to everyone's tastes but they are meant to be functional and the squeeze controls more than make up for the slightly divisive look few wireless earbuds are as well designed and robust as the air pods pro and Apple users especially will love how seamlessly they integrate with their existing iPhones with great sound a match alright guys that's all for now if you enjoyed this video please go ahead and leave a like if you're new to the channel and you liked the video consider subscribing we do our best

For this review, we tested headphones under $ 100 with Bluetooth and Noise Canceling. You better be ready for the JBL TUNE600BTNC. Because if these are available in every country, they are the cheapest JBL headphones with Noise Canceling. So let's see if these are the headphones you've been looking for for weeks, or for months, or years ... Anyway, the headphones box is pretty simple. Nothing special about it. At the back you can see the headphones in the box and there are also some specifications on the back, but I'll get to that later. First we will see what we find in the packaging. As you can see, the headphones come in a sturdy plastic package and they come With two cables. A white and an orange cable. These cables are a good start to it about the accessories and the first is the manual for the JBL TUNE600. The second is the white cable and this is the audio cable, because you can do this use headphones wirelessly and wired. The third is the orange cable and this is the charging cable. It's a Micro-USB to USB-A cable, so it is probably the umpteenth for the cable collection. These headphones need 2 hours charging and this makes the battery life 12 hours, but Noise Canceling plays a big role role in this. If you use Noise Canceling the battery will run out It lasts 12 hours and if you don't use it, you can enjoy your favorite music for up to 22 hours. You may be asking yourself now; what are the main specifications? Well, let me answer that question for you. On the right side of the JBL TUNE you will find every connection and button. On top of there is a Micro-USB connection for the charging cable. At the bottom is the volume control, an audio jack, the Noise Canceling button and the on / off button that also turns on the Bluetooth. Because there is a separate button for Noise Canceling, we speak of '' Active Noise Canceling ''. You can easily turn it on and off. I have had the TUNE600 for a week now and have it with and without Noise Cancellation and I have to admit it's a good feature. But don't expect them to be better than more expensive headphones with Noise Cancellation. They are excellent for the price. Because they are on-ear headphones the '' Passive Noise Reduction '' is not as good as over-ear headphones. As I mentioned earlier, the battery life depends on the use of Noise Cancellation. As with other JBL headphones, the battery indicator leaves you alone know when to charge it. The JBL app supports this JBL TUNE600BTNC not yet as far as I know. But you can look for apps that have the percentage display battery of Bluetooth devices connected to your phone. Let's talk about the materials and build quality of the JBL TUNE600. The headphones have neat leather ear cushions and the headband also has a leather cushion. And the headphones mainly consist of sturdy plastic. Build quality is good but not great. You can extend the headband and the headphones feel solid, but you don't want to stretch them too long, because it's guaranteed to break ... In addition, you can also fold the JBL TUNE600 so that you can easily take it with you. To be clear, no cover or case is included. Okay everyone, now the most important part. Based on the sound quality they amazed me. The vocals sound great, the bass is good and the instruments come into their own. So it's perfect for the music I'm listening to and really worth the money in my opinion. But they are still on-ear headphones and they have a serious amount of sound loss. So you can't use everywhere at a normal volume unless you want angry faces around you. Another thing I want to talk about is the comfort of the headphones, because this is the biggest drawback. They are simply not comfortable. They are sitting very tight and after an hour they hurt and I want to take them off. Maybe this is a personal matter, but they are different in comparison with other JBL headphones. So in general they are really worth the money, Sound quality is great, compliments to JBL, The Noise Canceling is a great feature and the durability is reasonable. Based on the fit, I advise everyone to try them before buying. Maybe they suit you, maybe they don't. At the time of this review, prices are around 99 dollars or 130 euros. And they are available in WHITE, BLACK, BLUE and PINK colors. Let me know which headphones you are currently using or maybe you will buy the JBL 600TUNE. Regardless, I hope this review helped you.

And for now, have a great day!"

headphones|bluetooth headphones|geekyranjit,2020-10-07 10:22:45.937461," hi guys this is Ranjith Ann in this video let's do the review of the Sennheiser HD 315 bluetooth headphones and quite a few of you have asked me to actually test out some reputable audio brand for example senator is a very old audio brand this is a company from Germany and they do make what do you say high-end headphones microphones etc for example in movies and stuff a lot of sensor microphones are used in stuff like that so I thought why not test some of them and this one is one of their most affordable Bluetooth headphones and this is a new range of the BT 350 and they also have 450 450 has active noise cancellation this is not hot and guys this is not a review nut or anything I purchased this one from Amazon and I purchased this on 26th of July and I purchase it for five thousand nine hundred but today when I looked at Amazon the pricing is 7490 I just wanted to be transparent about that so let's look at this and I would say initially when I got it the first day I was hugely disappointed with this one and if it was just the first day of usage I would have given a very low rating of just four out of ten because the sound simply did not sound that good on this one but after a Berlin of about almost about 12 or 13 hours that cans really opened up and then the sound signature was good but again I won't say this is for everyone if you are looking for that extended bass or something then you will simply not like it this is sort of for more of the purest kind of person but again it simply does not have that regular Sennheiser a sound signature that was very surprising to me but before we talk about the sound what I like what I did not like let's have a closer look at this and as you can see it comes in this big box over here and we also have an app for both iPhone as well as Android I tested it on Android so I'll just keep the box to the side so these are the earphones and as you can see you can fold them like this and by the way guys no case was also given in the box so nothing that get in the box apart from this you just get a USB type-c charging cable so it folds in like this and again the entire construction is plastic guys but the build quality is good as you can see I can flex it and it will not break so the build quality is actually good and much better than some of the other headphones that are even more expensive than this one I have noticed and again this level like this and this one also swagger struggles and we have quite a bit of padding here so it was comfortable to me on my ears but again guys this is just a vehicle leather kind of a thing so what I did notice is that after you wear it for about 45 minutes your gears will definitely get a little bit warm so after 45 minutes I had to just remove it for some time for five minutes and wear it again so that is something that you have to it's not breathable material but again in terms of their comfort they were comfortable to me it's not like my Bose QC 35 or the Sony WH 8000 MX that I have those are even more comfortable but they cost about 25 to 30 thousand so in that way it's good but one thing that I noticed is that if you look at this your cup the your cup so the cavity is slightly small I would say it's not a problem for my ears but again if you have a very big head again as you can see it what not cover your head fully so that is one thing that I notice and this is very strange coming from Sennheiser so that is something that I have noticed so you got to be careful with that in terms of connectivity here I like this one it supports new Bluetooth 5 and also has optics and Arctic's low latency and that aptX low latency is great if you have android-based smartphones they use that hence I did not have that lag that generally we have but bluetooth headphones even I watched a couple of movies a lot of videos I did not have that lip sync a show whereas I didn't test it with the iPhone with iPhone it will actually use a CC so I'm not very clear how good it will be in terms of that lip singing but when Android it was not so now let's go the physical aspect and if you look at it this is the right here and here you have a lot of buttons let's start from this side well this one is actually the power on/off button and you actually hold it for four seconds if you want to re pair it with another device and the pairing process was very comfortable not an issue and if you go over here you have the USB type-c port with this one and I would say the battery life is terrific on this one the box says 30 us but I feel the battery life will go even beyond 30 us because after almost about even 20 hours of usage it's still it was showing me around 50 percent battery life so I feel the battery life is a big strength of this one next if we move this is for the volume you can increase or load the one for example if you look at this this is an interesting button let me actually play it back as you can see my phone over here I'll just keep it here and I'll just press this it's playing music now and if I just move like this it's going to move to the next track and if you press slide it down it moves so it's very easy to navigate as you can see like this so I like that and if you want to pause the music you just press it once like this and the last button what we have is for Google assistant nfu but I said the Google assistant will invoke on your a smart phone so that's regarding the buttons and I would say the navigation has done very well on this it takes a couple of hours to get used to it I'll just pause the music guys but you get used to it very quickly and guys one strange thing I notice is that nowhere it is sort of written left and right so the right can cup has all the buttons don't we're at the other side and that's the mistake I did initially so in terms of buttons layout it's good and the Bluetooth range is excellent excellent on this one generally with many of the Bluetooth headset yes obviously it works in that room and if you just go outside the second term also some work some don't want this even work in the third room also which is actually very rare so in terms of Bluetooth connectivity they have done an incredible job err in my testing address this to smartphones this is the Samsung Note 10 live and even on the Motorola 1 fusion class and I did not have any issues in terms of Bluetooth connect tree so the Bluetooth connectivity is very strong on this one and now let's also talk about because we are doing a lot of work from home and staff we also do peak calls with this one it has integrated microphone on this one and you can take calls with this one and I would say the call quality I had mixed experiences with this one don't get me wrong other parties did not complain that I was sounding muddy or something so it looks like the microphone quality is good but what happened is that the receivers calls were sounding very unnatural it was doing some sort of processing so it was looking like it was coming from echo chamber so I did not like the incoming calls so again I did not like it if they should have just left it to natural they are doing some post-processing to amplify the vocals when you I'm taking calls looks like that and I simply did not like that it's not a deal breaker but I thought you guys should know that but in terms of battery life I know because of work from home most of you are actually wearing headphones for couple of hours that way the battery life is excellent now let's talk about one more thing on this one is let's talk about the sound because we get this for sound and as I've told you right now the pricing is for 7,500 so I'll take that in my mind and I checked even in us generally there are about 100 dollars so it's almost the same price that we are getting in us and here I had some very mixed reactions with this one again as I've told you guys you have to burn and this one for at least 10 to 12 hours but initially they sounded like the rubbish cans I was so disappointed with them but after the burnin I feel it open quite a bit but still I would say after the burnin now have used it for more than 20 22 hours I am assuming and still I would say the sound signature is not the typical sound signature that I would like from us and hyzer for example in bass yes bass is there it's not for bass edge if you are thinking that you are a basin and you like it you'll absolutely hate this one so it's not for bass heads but I know many of people who do not like that excessive bass that makes is there it comes but again the bass is not that punchy that I have noticed and that brings me to the mid-tones and the vocals here I enjoyed it quite a bit for example I listened to a lot of hindi songs also and those sounded brilliant on them because a lot of hindi songs have a lot of mid-range instruments and a lot of vocals they sounded beautiful on this one and in terms of genres of music before I talk about that in terms of hi this was very very surprising to me generally the said Iser headphones earphones the highs are produced brilliantly on them they have that sparkle feeling but that sparkle was simply missing on this one in fact I would say the highs were something that disappointed me considering it's Earth's Anheuser because most of the sennheiser for body said your phone's headphones have that slight sparkle on the treble end that was missing on this one fortunately what do you say by default what we had I'd simply did not like it but Sennheiser has an app for example let me just open it so very basic app works for both Android as well as what do you say iPhones and as you can see it's got a connected a texture what do you say phone it takes about a couple of seconds and as you can see it detected and it shows the battery life also as I Polly the battery life is one of those insane things and here we don't have a proper equalizer but as you can see you can customize this for example you can move this and this actually equalizes stuff and I had to do this with this for example I'm just going to invert this I made some by default will be this neutral like this and here I felt that the base and even the treble tones was slightly lacking I simply did not enjoy so I had to play around with this one and I put it here and I felt it was much better my daughter actually made this profile she listens to a lot of music trebles on and as you can see she had to boost up the treble quite a bit but the problem with this one is that for example if you boosting the treble like this the others Soundwave automatically adjust so very difficult to get the right pattern that you want you can definitely get it I have made some profiles here I basically like this trap slightly boosted troubles on this one and that way the sound signature improved so I don't like the fact that the default sound profile it neither pleases me on the base end nor on the higher end yes the vocals and the mid tones are really good so you have to really play with the app and get that setting right yes you can do it and I played for it for a couple hours and I got the profile right but again it's just too much work I feel for a headphone that is costing about 7500 to get the right sound signature and if you got an impatient person then you will simply not like this one because it requires a lot of work the good thing is that once you tweak the sound signature and set it it is actually set on the headphones and I used it with another what do you say phone that sound profile is automatically used so it stores that setting on the headphone so that is something that you like but I mean you got to play with that and if you are expecting boosted bass and something like that and this is not for you and if I have to read this one I would rate this one at about seven out of ten considering we don't get that typical sound signature and that sparkle on the high end that we expect from Sennheiser headphones for example to come here this one I had the audio technica m50x it's not a fair comparison that's a wider headphone and actually cost a little bit more I think so that's for eleven thousand that sounded very better than this one I enjoyed it a lot more and I would say if you don't want to if you are on a budget I have reviewed some sin either bad earphones for example the Sennheiser CX 275 s that's for just 1,500 rupees I felt I enjoyed the music a little bit more on that one because that had that typical Sennheiser sound signature so again a for people who do not like that excessive bass mostly if you like that neutral sound signature you like it but again if you are expecting that typical sennheiser sparkle on the high end these might not be for you so anyways guys that's it for my review of this one analyze if you're buying this use my link it does have the channel buying a lot of stuff myself and if you are a buy stuff from my affiliate link it does help the channel and will help me to buy more stuff and review anyways guys that's it for now thanks for watching this is Ranjit and I hope to see you in my next video take care packs"

headphones,2020-10-07 10:22:45.937507, hey everybody hope you're having a great Bose sound sport free wireless sounding day and today I'm looking forward to giving you a review and demo my overall experience with these Bose headphones I had really an opportunity to put them to the test and I look forward to sharing with you just again my full experience and I'll give you some examples as well get some close-ups how the app works connecting to your phone all the good stuff been a bose fan for a long time although it's been a little while since i've worn any Bose headphones I had picked up the Apple earpods because I knew of nothing really that Bose was coming out and then two weeks later BAM they they just came out with these headphones so I'm excited I initially had the sound sport wireless headphones but then there were some issues with crackling and hopefully they have really put these to the test to make an overall experience really good one and they're really cool a lot of features and capabilities so let's dive right in and I will put a link in the description where you can read other reviews order them they will be coming with other colors I'll put a link to my open boxing as well as my comparison video of how I thought the two matched up and which ones I gave a thumbs up to so let's go ahead and get started first of all when taking these out and charged them up for the first time there's two indicators as far as charge and got the case here it's down to one of five bars this will hold up to ten hours of charging and the headphones also have an indicator when they're in the case for charging those hold five hours so you're getting combined fifteen hours together and and again then you can just charge up the case and take it to go with you as far as the case eyes it is a very big case a little bit too big for my like you think about this case more if you're going to putting your purse in a bag whatever might be then carrying in your pocket because you put in your pocket gonna feel like it's gonna drag your your pants down it's bulky and you know so I think it's you know unfortunately just too big so I do keep that in mind but what you know it is what it is but if you are concerned about taking them on the go you know as I thought with the Apple earpods they slip right into your pockets so you know again keep that in mind I do want to by the way talk about price point $250 very expensive again this is on a premium headphones but you know it is a steep price point and at the end of the video I'll share with you if that justifies the cost so you know again I think they're a little bit high but you know Bose again makes a premium product so you pay for what you get but do they deliver with everything for that kind of money so let's talk about comfort with the ear pieces these are a silicone rubberized material they do fit in the ears very well it's got these wingtips and they just sit in the ear and once you put them in now initially when I put them in my ears they were they were uncomfortable for a little bit because I just had to get used to wearing them I don't you know I've always been a big fan but maybe because I hadn't worn him for a little while I just take a little getting it just to - because I again I was wearing the Apple earpods but they stay in the air very comfortable to wear and and the nice part is they come in a few different sizes for the ear pieces with the wingtips which that very well on the ear have always been a fan of these ear pieces they come in three sizes you got the small the medium and the large the medium will be on the ear pieces when you take it out of the packaging I found the smaller size fits best for my ear it's a very soft silicone rubberized piece the rubberized or the white piece here this can be bent so it's a little bit of a harder rubberized material but what I love about what Bose has done is made it so easy to put these on ear pieces so you basically just slide it on like this and it just locks right into place just like that it's on just that easy and again for the lefty area you just slide it on and then there's a little hook here and then you just hook that on into place and you are good to go again very easy to change very comfortable to put in your ears so as you can see it's very easy to put on and again they are extremely comfortable to wear so when taking them out of the casing once you've got them all charged up it's a it's very cool it does tell you it gives you an indicator one how much percentage of battery life is remaining and two it will say it's now connected to your device so that's really cool feature when you're taking them out now you could turn that notification on and off with the app and I'll show you that towards the end of the video where I'll get into more of the app and the details there so very cool there as far as again the headphones very comfortable they stayed in the ear well I even when I was working out and getting on a pension depending upon lequip meant you know stayed in they stayed in very well so as far as next up bluetooth connectivity Bluetooth connectivity worked very well I did put them to the test at the gym where on one side of the gym I had my phone sitting in my bag and then I walked the other side of the gym and I was able to walk 56 steps where before it broke up so I was able to go a good distance I also did a test where I went into another room around the walls and the connection connection stayed very well so that is you know a very good thing as far as the connection with the Bluetooth so one of the negative is however with the Bluetooth is lip syncing when watching a video so I'm going to show you here a difference when watching a video on YouTube versus watching a video on your phone and you'll see unfortunately the syncing does not really match up very well on the YouTube but it does seem to work okay watch videos on the phone so if watching videos is important to you with these headphones then you're gonna get frustrated so do keep in mind but here we go here's an example of both with the YouTube video and on the phone okay so first I'm going to show you the YouTube video this is me doing a review on a Brooke shoe I'm going to go ahead and put the right ear piece next to my microphone so you can hear the audio as I press play okay so you clearly can hear how the lips did not match the voice now just to show you I am going to now show you this video of video I just recorded directly into the phone and how the lips do match the voice again I will put the earpiece next to my microphone so you can hear while watching the video so let me go ahead and press play so you can clearly see how the video did match the video shot right on the phone directly so as far as listening to music this is where I've always been a very big fan of bows their music sounds great the music pops great bass overall great experience and in these headphones do get very loud so that is a plus but you do hear some of the background noise even at full blast or the highest volume so do keep that in mind but again the sound from listening to rock the jazz I did have different types of testing and music sounded very good one of the things to keep in mind which is in combination with the Bluetooth connection and listening music is you have to have the right year out of case so you don't have the flexibility if you just want to listen on the right ear or the left ear it will be in both I mean you could keep the left ear in the case and you'll still hear out of the right ear but you don't have the flexibility of deciding which your piece you want to listen to music out of so again just keep that in mind with listening to music but music is superb as far as phone calls I was very pleased with phone calls Bose has a good microphone I found I was able to hear people well people were able to hear me well one of the challenges again with the earpieces is that you can only hear your phone calls out of the right ear you can't have it listen with the left ear so unfortunately that to me is a little frustrating where as well with the music you want to have that flexibility you can't have that with these headphones so do keep that in mind now what I want to do is that play some examples of calls so you can hear the call quality but also hear background noise in three examples one is at my computer where I had some music in the background the second is in my car and third it's at the gym so that will give you a perspective of three different types of environments how it picks up and and then I'll be back and give you my my thoughts there I'm leaving a voicemail test with the sound sport free wireless headphones I have music playing in the background so I want you to hear the noise that I picked up in the background with music and I'm sitting right by my computer I'm going to step away from my computer now stepping away from my computer I am about six feet or late maybe a little less than six feet from my computer I hope this part of the review is of help if you enjoy the wireless headphones I am doing a voice mail test of the Bose sound support free wireless headphones I am on the highway driving so it gives you an idea of how the voice sounds as well as a background noise if you're in the car making a call and I am doing about 60 miles an hour hope this part of the review is a help I am leaving a voicemail test as a method Jim wanted to hear any background sound and it did pick up I'm using the Bose sound for free wireless headphones I hope this part of the reviewers have helped have a great day okay so you did although there was background noise I found you I would still have to hear my voice so do keep in mind you know with the background noise in the microphone it doesn't completely block that the background noise out but I think it does a pretty good job it's certainly not perfect but that will give you an idea there so what I want to do next and last is to share with you some examples how to connect your phone to the app also I'll get into the controllers as well and in some other videos that I find would be helpful so my final thoughts before I share that with you is I do like these headphones it is price point very high the case is too big there are some to me some challenges as far as the flexibility there so you know I'm still up in the air here what I what I want to do I've been really pleased with the Apple earpods and they really do give bow is a good run for the money bows again makes it an excellent product but great sound music good call quality you know these are you know these do look funny Casey nice that said they look like pacifiers in the ears because you know they are they are so big the way they they stick out but you know most importantly are you getting a good experience do you get to enjoy your music do you get to enjoy the calls and again keep in mind as well for YouTube videos you're gonna have an issue there so thanks again for watching this video again you know be sure to click on the link where you can read other reviews of course order them and last but not least here are other helpful videos and I hope the rest of this video is enjoyable and beneficial thanks again for watching here you go ok let's go ahead and pair the sounds board free headphones to my iPhone I'm gonna go ahead and open up the app as you can see opens up to the black and white logo gives you some information here they have to agree Bose Connect collects diagnostic and usage data to improve our product and services troubleshoot errors if you do not want to collect this data you can opt out through the privacy policy tab of the main menu so I'm going to click agree and now it's going out to look for the sound support free wireless earbuds so I'm going to go ahead and open up the case and I am going to take both out you need to take both out of the case I am dropping down as it's suggested and now it's saying select an accessory I'm gonna click on the device and now it is connected so just to show you as well if you go into settings Bluetooth and there it is it's connected and so you don't have to worry about pairing the app does it automatically for you and we'll put these down here for a moment so think let's make things easy we're downloading an update to your product would you like us to notify you when it's ready to install and you could say notify me or no thanks oh say notify you and there you go so you got the battery indicator for the earbuds you've got your volume control here which is nice that you can control it from the earbuds or you could do it from the app and then you've got the Bluetooth logo here are bits of information and controlling of the device so you can change the the name if you want to change the name you can click surprise me so you can do that and have a little fun there you can do the product tour and it will show you in highlight the features and this would do the same thing if you're going to do this within an Android device you have connections so you could connect to multiple devices you have the auto timer so it would automatically shut off when you are not using the sound support free you can even change it to never if you don't want to ever turn it off and then you have voice prompts so you have the ability to turn that off turn it on prompt language all the different languages that you could see you could set it to your language you got your user manual so which is great it's smart you know need a book and everything is right here for you if you should have any questions for example how do I check the headphone battery level you can click on that and then it gives you a description right here with images so Bose did a very very good job product info so you got all that information there and again lots of great detail disconnect and then if you press on that top left icon you could find my buds introducing find my buds and you could see where they were last found so very cool feature product help so quick tips how do I find my lost earbuds how long did the headphones take to charge how long does the charging case take so very very cool there and it shows here takes up to two hours to fully charge that the case a full charge of the case allows you to charge your headphones up to two times when the case is battery is fully charged all five battery indicators below solid white so you got some information there again lots of great details all in here terms and condition and all that great stuff so you can see there is a lot of information that you can do within the app and control as well of these fantastic earbuds as far as the connection goes with the Bluetooth and the phone it works very well as soon as you do take the earbuds out of the casing it will then connect to your device and it will also give you an indicator in your ear to let you know that it is now connected unless you turn off that feature where you would not hear that voice telling you that it's connected so you have the ability to easily connect to your phone when you put them back in the case you can see it is now not connected so it's very responsive

JoesGE.com is a pretty cool place (depending who you talk to it might be more than pretty cool. But hey, I'm just writing this down so that it says something down here, because that's more professional right?) and if you're still reading along at this point you might as well sit down and grab some popcorn because this is about to trail on about how we are this premiere repair service located in Washington State North of Seattle in basically the ""Armpit of the US"" near Mt baker (Mt Baker has the world record for most snowfall at 1,140 inches in a season). Even though it can smell bad around here we love the fresh air and being near the post office and in a quiet sleepy mountain town certainly gives us much closer access to Team Turtle and Team Beaver (Watch our ""Who, what, when and where is JoesGE?"" video if you don't get the reference). 
All this to basically say that we are all addicted to coffee and stay in the warehouse for ridiculously long hours in order to keep up with the demands of the youth for these two sided head audio devices and speakers that float when you throw them in the ocean or in your bathtub to test if they actually float. On top of that we do like it when less stuff ends up in landfills so we hoard everything on shelves with wheels so that we pollute less, it just sits in our warehouse loosing molecules slowly over time degrading to become smaller and smaller. 

If you are still reading at this point you deserve an award, or a high five, or something because you must either be the most patient person on the planet, or you read blogs frequently. And if the latter is the case, then this whole thing must seem pretty short so lets keep going. 
We do some really interesting things here at JoesGE which are frequently documented in our sometimes weekly sometimes never vlogs. 
Also, if you are wondering how we keep up with the demands of the people so well, its because 90% of the people that work here are all Russian around getting things done most of the time. Yes, that was a pun, you are welcome. We hope you have a pun filled day, because who couldn't use a few laughs?",28,142262,363.0,1017.0,117.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dcucWgyi-CA/hqdefault.jpg,Beats|Sony|Bose|headphones repair

10:22:45.937528, he also co-hosted Joe with Joe's gaming electronics another popular video requested by our amazing YouTube fans and we made a previous solo three wireless fake vs. real video we're gonna link it up here and today we're doing a studio three Wireless fake versus real this came in from a customer and we had to break the bad news to them that hey the item you sent to us is counterfeit and these are the reasons why and we want to educate you guys so you guys can make better purchasing decisions of course the best thing is to make sure you buy from a known source you can buy from us you can buy from other big companies that have a good reputation on selling authentic unions you can check out our website jiu-ge calm for all your electronics needs we're gonna go through a couple of quick steps and how you can tell if your beats are fake or real now that the beats have the w1 chip install that's actually super simple to check all you have to do is power on your beats you hold it for about three seconds and your lights are going to start flashing once they flash go ahead and take your mobile device put it right next to you and turn make sure your blue suits on and it'll actually connect with the w1 chips showing your studio three oscillating in a circle I'll also show the color of your item and because of that you know it's a legit pair that's a really simple easy way because that's a w1 chip big ones will not have that and because of that you will know for a fact that you have a legitimate pair just because your beats have a serial number does not mean that you're authentic they are mimicking at a legitimate serial number and the household database and it's been replicated many times and these factories are smart they do that and we want to show you guys a couple quick distinct differences if you look here at the headband just looking at the color it's very distinct you can tell the difference that this one is definitely darker than the authentic the authentic one is here this is the counterfeit pair you also look at the beats logo the color is completely off this is specifically for the shadow gray region a couple of quick color comparisons the hinges are a nice shiny gold if you look over here they're kind of just it looks like they put a little sticker over the top of it and it's not really the best alright more importantly than all of this is really what's going on on the inside of your headphones what's going on in the inside of your headphones so we have a couple parts would like to compare and show you guys so these this is an authentic studio a three-part it's black here has all the technology you need as the power capabilities to make sure your city trees are functioning properly here is an aftermarket one the insides are different that's what you're paying for you pay for a technology that beats making and there's an aftermarket board right here it's really crappy quality it's kind of feeling you very quickly and it's not going to function properly not like in studio is supposed to sound so we have the two power boards right here this is the more important more this is a Bluetooth board this is where the w1 chip is located the Bluetooth board has all the magic in there to make it connect to your film better you have better streaming you're not gonna have any interruptions and it also makes sure that you have a significantly longer lasting battery this ship is works a lot of magic and the aftermarket ones that counter the ones are not going to have this chip which is going to allow for you to have a really shitty sound experience I had batteries batteries they're all pretty similar in general but this is what I'm nothing beats battery sounds like this is what the aftermarket beats Donnie looks like not sounds like alright and we wanted to show you guys a matte black there so this is a fake mount black outside panel this is a real matte black outside panel even looking at the logo you can definitely tell the difference and that is something significant just to keep in mind beats is gonna make high quality stuff that's we don't make it if they don't make high quality stuff they're not gonna have a lot of customers so they want to make sure that they have the best quality product and they're gonna use the best package they can and with an authentic headband if you look at a headband you take a legitimate part of here and if you take and put on some kind of floor level you should be able to take it and put it all the way down to the ground like that bounce back up that's how you know how you have a high quality part if you buy some shitty part off eBay for our third of the price of an authentic part you do that it's gonna snap right in half so that's how you know that you're using authentic beats don't do that she beats don't bend them like this bad idea you're gonna rip something break something but if you have a separate part like this thing for you to try that out and if you're doing on the ebay part don't try now just return that thing make sure you find an authentic part and that's really what you're paying for is an authentic part high-quality parts yeah the internals that are really good you have all the sound quality that's built in there and everything seems to work properly alright folks hope that helps you guys out you guys have any more questions any more requests go ahead and check out our page ugh comment like subscribe share it up and hope you guys enjoyed this video and this is joe signing out how great [Music]

headphones|headphones that sound good,2020-10-07 10:22:45.937570, what's up guys welcome back to unbox junkie my name is Matt and today we're looking at a towel Tronics product now these ones are the taotronics anc bluetooth headphones they have dual 40 millimeter drivers they're saying that it has powerful bass and I'm quoting expect aggressive bass with balanced mid levels and bright highs so my expectations are high now they do run off of bluetooth 4.2 the active noise cancellation they're saying is so good that you're gonna have your own personal oasis of quiet nice you know I love a good carrying case fantastic very nice heavy duty feels pretty solid ooh those are nice-looking add an extended 18 months to your warranty all right so we got a couple cables here we've got about a 4-foot USB to micro USB cable and about a 5 foot 3.5 millimeter cable so you can go wired or wireless which is always good okay first off Oh while these feel really nice these feel premium oh man these aren't gonna go wearing out on you in five minutes that's for sure Wow look at that that's super cushy that feels like memory foam almost now of course you can do this so you can store it away for safe for safe travel it's got a 90 degree swivel supersoft protein ear pad it feels very high quality for sure it does not feel cheap in any way wow I really like that ergonomic headband which you can tell it's got a very nice cushion on the top I like that that's a good it's a good squeeze it's a real good squeeze they're saying that the materials used ensure minimum weight and maximum comfort for long term where it's plastic but it doesn't feel cheap so they got the extension right there very nice these feel really good feels like the one of the best feeling headphones I've had in my hands in a while alright so right here it looks like you got the power switch for the ANC as you can see the blue light turned on you've got your 3.5 millimeter jack right there so you can plug it in and hardwire it on the right ear Cup you've got the micro USB port for charging and you have your basic control so pause play forward back where's the microphone don't tell me there's no microphone there's got to be a microphone okay so the microphone is so the microphone is over here that's what they're saying I don't know I don't see it maybe it's in the crack or something oh wow let's try them on though oh yeah oh I like these a lot oh they're not really big but they cover the ear nice and comfortably that protein leather that protein right there it's so cushioning it's so soft I don't see my ears getting sore at all from these all these feels really nice alright let's flip on that anc so I can hear central air flowing I can hear fans going as soon as I turn on the ANC this white the time suey and Brian from Family Guy went to the multiverse and they went to the all-white universe yeah that's that's what I'm seeing in my head right now as I'm hearing this this is crazy that's really good alright turn that off all right so I'm gonna power it on power on you're supposed to say pairing oh there we go okay so it doesn't even say pairing mode it just goes straight into it so there we go the taotronics TTB h20 too [Music] it's got some good sound but flip the ANC on wait a minute whoa when I turn the E&amp;C on the sound it sound like it got more powerful very weird yeah it got a lot it's like a little bit louder alright so and see usually when I hit the ANC while I'm listening to music it usually has like an adverse effect toward the music this time it didn't it actually sounded like it kind of boosted the power of the music just a little bit very interesting okay let's just see what it's got in a bass Department it's a very smooth excuse me excuse me it's a very smooth bass I don't know if I would call it powerful it's very good it's very well equalized uh I hand it to them is pretty well equalized for sure they weren't lying about that but powerful bass but I think powerful bass I think something that's gonna like like like shake my brain you know I've expect I've experienced some of those I wouldn't say powerful I would say vibrant it's vibrant it is a vibrant bass for sure and vibrance is not bad that's not a bad thing but powerful bass all right let's uh let's test some quality very clear all right I'm gonna do a distance test I'll be right back all right um I went outside to the supermarket I wish I never really lost signal there was a slight jitter but I went like 50 feet very good connection and I gotta say clarity wise amazing amazing very very good okay let's make a phone call call my boy Nathan hey yeah work I'll make it quick I'm testing out some headphones how do I sound do I sound like I'm on some under I sound like I'm just talking to you is normal on the phone big plus yeah you sound pretty good too all right man I don't wanna take up in your time you want you want to say hi to the junkies okay well there we go phone call was really good Nathan said that I sounded like I was talking on on a phone which that's always a plus super comfortable they fit perfectly around my ears these these are very comfortable shake test real quick not happening okay I love the cushion on here it's minimal because you see it's not real thick and it's and it's not real wide it's it only goes to a certain point but that's all you need you don't need a whole bunch of extra big stuff very low profile with the big sound you can use that taotronics low profile with big sound I really like a very simple interface easy to use a and C and very functional ANC highs and mids absolutely great give him a 9 out of 10 they're really really good very Chris very clear bass I'm gonna give them the same powerful bass I can't agree with that and you know because they're labeling it as powerful bass change it to vibrant bracelet I'll give it a 9 but for now I'm gonna give it an 8 and that's and that's because it sounds really really good definitely suggest checking them out if $70 is in your price range and you're looking for some that's got probably $100 sound quality to it counter Onix has got it it's pretty good I'll leave a link down below as usual but I leave it in your hands you guys go check it out for yourself but as for now get out of here

review|best cheap wireless earbuds|jaybird vs beats headphones|best budget wireless headphones,2020-10-07 10:22:45.937612, what's up guys I'm Jeff Rizzo from rizz nose Calm subscribers you know that if you're not a subscriber make sure to subscribe because you're gonna love this channel we do a lot of cool stuff and today we're gonna talk about what I think my case for the best wireless headphones under $100 so we do a lot of reviews on this channel but one thing I don't think we've done enough of is best lists and we specifically haven't focused on more affordable items so I really want to talk to you about what I think what my opinion is regarding the best ones that are under 100 bucks make sure to hit that thumbs up button if you enjoy the video and found it helpful let's get to it [Applause] okay so first up in my opinion the best wireless headphones you can v for under $100 are the beats X Wireless so yes I know you're gonna say this they're 150 dollars well yeah they are that's their MSRP but we find them every single day or at least every week for under $100 I'll link them down below in the description so you can check them out for yourself but my point here is that you can get one hundred and fifty dollar headphones for 99 dollars as long as you shop at the right time or look for a deal and these headphones are awesome our good friend Brian Oliver who runs a limo company worse than every single day we see him all the time and he just raised about these headphones I personally have tested them I've reviewed them and there's a heck of a lot to like so they are around the neck headphones they're a little bit longer and then a magnet together so it's really convenient to grab them they do have fast fuel charging as well which means five minutes of charging gets you two hours of playback so if you're on the go you can charge them for five minutes you're getting a two hours worth of battery life and then on top of that they have about eight hours on a single charge so you charge them up you get about eight hours of listening time I think the audio quality is pretty good as well and if you're an iOS user they sync seamlessly with your iOS account and it's really easy to set up on top of that because the cord is a little bit longer and they have that inline remote and mic it puts up a little closer to your face so you get a nice crisp signal when you're talking to somebody on the phone and that's really important if you're using everyday headphones like the beats X Wireless so I think 50 dollar headphones you're getting for like 99 bucks check our website out or check our deals app out that's a completely free iOS and Android app we don't sell the stuff we just find them 100 best deals of the day subscribers you know this so check that stuff out when you get a chance yeah I think the beats X Wireless are awesome headphones now if I was gonna say the best workout headphones though that are wireless and they're under $100 I'm gonna go jaybird X threes these are headphones I've used personally for over a year I use them every single day and yes they have an MSRP of 130 dollars but I find it for 99 bucks on a weekly basis so check that out as well again you're getting $130 headphones they're 99 bucks I'm kind of cheating here but I'd rather look at the actual prices rather than the MSRP so these headphones I think have a really good fit you can wear them over your ear which is a little bit more of a sporty design that means that the cable is strung up against your head and there's no bounce in the cable basically what it means is it eliminates any annoyance from having a cable next to your head so I love the X 3s for that fact you can also wear them in the traditional under ear design for phone calls for things like that they do come with different ear tips and ear fins they even come with the comply ear tips which are foam and those are awesome it's a little off-putting at first but they're great for sound isolation and they're really great for increasing the audio quality and you're really getting no audio bleed so those check those out they're also completely sweat proof I've worn them in the shower absolutely no issues and the battery life is actually better than what chambered States so they say like eight hours I've had them go nine hours plus and obviously that depends on your volume level but still the battery life is really good on the X threes my biggest downside with these headphones is the fact that they use a proprietary charging cable which means if they do die on you you have to use that charging cradle you can't just use like a standard microUSB or something like that's why it kind of sucks but I'm sure it helps with like the waterproofing now one thing they have over most headphones out there is that they have a completely customizable EQ setting so you can change your personal sound preferences any time you want within that jaybird app so I have a custom sound preference that I use for like country or classic and it makes the music sound better to me so you can adjust things like the bass the mids as well as the highs so that's one thing that j-bird has that very few other companies have you'll see them have three different sound signatures but you'll rarely see a company that allows you to adjust everything so if you love rap music you may want to adjust the bass all the way up so that's one thing that I really like about j-bird now if I was gonna choose a budget pair of headphones and I know I set headphone spot I mean earphones like most people use earphones I'm gonna go with the anchor sound bud slim plus which are the earphones that I'm wearing right now it'd be kind of odd if I was wearing some others I'm earphones I really like these things I mean there are 30 bucks I've seen them as cheap as $25 again I'll link them down below in the description they are incredibly comfortable they do come with different ear fins and ear tips so they have three different sizes that you can choose from on top of that they have the magnetic earbuds so when you want to wear them around your neck so they're great for all day carry and they're great for the gym as well because they are IP x5 certified which means that they're water resistant and sweat resistant and you're not gonna have an issue there the audio quality is pretty decent they do have three different sound signatures it's nothing to write home about but the audio quality is pretty good for $30 headphones one thing I don't like about these earphones is that they're kind of a little bit on the larger end they stick out from your ear quite a bit so it's not like it really matters it does increase the wind noise with the headphones like if you're biking or something you'll get a little bit more wind noise it doesn't really bother me but it kind of protrudes quite a bit so if you're petits maybe law pudding for you and look I don't want to dwell on these things then act like they're their greatest headphones ever I mean they're 30 bucks but for 30 dollars I really don't think you're gonna be disappointed I think there's some of the best earphones that you can get on Amazon on a budget so let me know what you think though like genuinely have you tried out these earphones do you like them do not like them have you tried out any of the earphones or headphones on this list let me know and I'll see you guys in the next video have a great day [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

earphones,2020-10-07 10:22:45.937633, [Music] what's going on YouTube this is what would Josh you and I want to make a quick little video I'm going to be reviewing this phone here very soon maybe today maybe tomorrow I don't know I'm going to be reviewing it very soon but Ankur sent me these about a week ago but I've been pretty busy and I haven't gotten around to it but I'm glad and do it now these are the anchors sound bud slim one of the things that kind of encouraged me to make this video was I was at Walmart yesterday and apparently a lot of the things I make videos on anchor now has at Walmart available at least here in Kansas City if some people are telling me or my Twitter where I posted the tweet the Walmart stuff that they don't have any of their local Walmart so just them look out some of these things you can actually go by your local Walmart and joining has to order from Amazon so that's pretty awesome anchors making it pretty big out there so we've got a pouch with the stuff in it some extra little ear size things and while lots of them actually and then we've got the little tiny itsy-bitsy charger to charge them up and then we have the instruction booklet which what I uh get stuck and can't quite figure something out so in here it looks like it's a little clip actually there you go this one is for those of us with different sized ear holes you have a lot to choose from there look at that a tiny a medium and the extra little extra large and then if you prefer a different style one they've got these as well so mammy or this this goes on no matter what actually but they've got two sizes in here this is kind of cool they give you lots of options to choose from as far as the size of your ear and the size of the whole inside you or your ear canal or whatever so that's awesome look at that alright the actual earbuds are in here let's take a look at these I sell these at Walmart and I was like hey I have those I just haven't used them yet look at that look at that that's awesome and it comes with one on there right away so actually there's like four different sizes for those of you with different sized ears and then three sizes for the like clip it goes around your ear and then we've got some volume up volume down like a play/pause answer mute like a universal all in one button and Oh a little charging port right there to go ahead and charge this sucker up so let's go ahead and just see what happens when I plug in a charger and then turn the hook read a sucker for ever it's a little banged up let's see what happens here little red light comes on right there letting it so it's charged there is another light next to it it might be the one that turns on when it's fully charged up not quite sure at the moment let's go ahead and turn these on I'm assuming just this would be the power button if it's not on yep okay so that little red lights now blue and it's pulsing let's know it's searching so let's go in our settings here sound bud slim right away pair it up a little light solid now can be used for call and audio or call for calls and sound that's pretty cool and then let's go ahead put these around her ear all right the default ones actually fit me quite well I'll go ahead and get a little front-facing camera view of myself you can see my ugly mug I do apologize the normal ones actually fit quite well and I know you will be able to hear this obviously but I'm just going to go ahead and play something for me to listen to all right let's assume this song good old song here that's quite nice actually sell out to get and does have an independent volume over here they actually have their own independent volume it doesn't show up on the phone when you turn it up oh my that's loud actually quite hurt that hurts okay that hurts actually it's got its own independent volume so turn it up all the way on here or most of the way and then turn it up and down as you want it on the headset like that would you like that something's getting in the way something's just about to break I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane all that these things sound great and they are extremely loud to the point where they actually can do ear damage probably if you listen to them at their loudest volume for a while I will have a link to these in the description if you want to purchase one of these for yourself or you can just go to your local Walmart if they have them like mine does and pick these up they sound great this is all it is hanging from your neck there's no extra cables they're not huge ones that go

again with another video and today we're gonna take a look at the clips t5 true wireless earbuds now you can pick these up on Amazon I'll put a link up in the description the price on these 200 bucks now I've been getting a lot of requests to check these out so let's check them out let's go through the features you've got legendary clip sound you getting bluetooth 5.0 with aptX and AAC you've got 8 hours worth of battery on a single charge with an additional 24 hours using a charging case so that's a total of 36 hours now these also feature quick charts so if you put them in the case for 15 minutes you get two hours with the playtime now the ipx4 splash-resistant you've got four mics for phone calls and you got access to Google or Siri now alright so all of that for 200 bucks let's see what it is first things first shout out the white shoes back in the building white shoes calm down alright here we go clips t5 true wireless earbuds let's see did we miss anything alright true wireless earphones with the charging case sweat resistant patented oval ear tips for ultimate comfort and excellent seal for noise isolation so he's got the oval tips legendary detailed and dynamic clip sound for mics with clear voice chat eight hours battery 20 flaws with the case pretty much let me grab a little unboxing knife got the incredible home today look at that little seal I like that alright that's nice wrap here we go all right my bad yeah I forgot to put my phone on solid here we go okay inside got a nice presentation alert alright let's see that's your usual books and [ __ ] plug them in follow me okay now check out this charging case oh now this is 100% aluminium you feel that cold steel this case is mad heavy I like that already USB types are type C charging on the back okay now these will flap open here's what it is here's the air buds now one thing I gotta say I'm not too big on the clips Brandon on the air buds like that I like mines to be a little bit more discreet well hey if you're a big Clips fan then you want everybody to know you got the clips joints it is what it is now check these out these are the oval tips so clips claims like these are gonna be the most comfortable ear buds on the market because of these oval tips shoes school scoop let's drop them in the case and see how they fit okay that's one and there's your other one okay so these are charging up you see you got some LEDs inside the case let's do the shake test and see if these pop out easy okay good so they don't fall out root too easily let's see what else you get in here okay USB type-c charging cable I shoes handle that let's see this is USB type-c to USB a alright that's a nice touch and some different sized ear chips and that's pretty much it alright now let me do the smell test on these and they smell like quality all right 200 bucks that's what you expect I gotta say this one more time this might be the heaviest charging case that I've seen yet matter of fact let me pull out my favorite charging case the master and dynamics mwo 7 this is also steel case aluminum steel whatever you want to call it let's see yeah the clips is definitely a little bit heavier and it looks a little bit nicer because you see how this one got all scratched up this one kind of looks like brushed aluminium so maybe gonna get less scratches on this one alright so let me pause the video I grab a phone will pair these up and then we start the usual testing talk amongst yourselves alright guys we'll be back in now I got these all paired up so now let's test them out now for the pairing process real simple once you take them out of the case they'll automatically power up and there'll be a bluetooth pairing mode go your phone's bluetooth menu and select the T files next as far as the look like I said I could do without the clips Brandon but they don't look bad at all these are supposed to be the most comfortable and I will say this they are super comfortable let me slap them back in my ears now if you look closely they are right and left branded so let me put them back in like I said yeah the fit is very comfortable let me adjust them correctly and do my head shake test alright I'll start with 50% shake each okay now they're wobbling a little bit but they haven't fallen out yet let's do 75% shaking okay look all right that was 75% shaking and the left one popped out now look this little cone-shaped design on it they don't really fit your ears too snug so if you're gonna be doing heavy activities running working out these might not be the ones these will be perfect for sitting at your desk maybe catching a flight somewhere doing your usual commute but as you seen for yourself 75% shake it they pop right out and you put them back in alright now this is how you're gonna look in your ears not bad at all but like I said I'm just not a fan of the Brandon but that's for you to be the judge of now most importantly how do they sound let's grab some music alright so I got some Lisa Lisa I wonder if I take you home queued up we're gonna try this at max volume one tap for playing pause let me grab my mic even though I promise y'all I'm not gonna sing I want to be prepared here we go Birdman hands rubbing together let's get it on okay they're definitely loud nice noise isolation okay all right I thought to feel something od sound good I do definitely sound good I know you're wondering why I won't go over to your place I'm not too sure how so I rather go at my own pace if we get together emotions will start over I may do something I might regret the next day when I now look I got to keep a real job these are super comfortable I even though they're not for sports right there was an advertised for sports so these ain't gonna be the best for the gym but if you're doing like I'm doing right now just sitting at your table at work sitting on the bus sitting on the train sitting on that flight the level of comfort or knees is amazing now I will say another thing I'm having a little problem that one side keeps cutting out like the left hair but kind of keeps cutting out so I'm gonna pause the video I'm gonna play a few more songs and do a little bit more testing but I don't like that I so far the Bluetooth connection I'm gonna try a different phone also see if we can make this work unpaired I'm and repair them again but sound quality wise sound quality wise yeah I like these I don't like these alright so let me uh let me try something else real quick hold up alright so check this out not just paired these up to three different phones I'd use my iPhone I got a one plus seven pro right here and I'm having the same problem the left ear bud keeps cutting in and out now here's our Bluetooth 5.0 I haven't done my full connection test yet but sitting right in front of the phone the connections should be super stable but it's not it's cutting in and out now in a side note the sandy review unit you see for yourself I copies directly from clips so these are the ones that you're gonna get so as of right now maybe I got a defective unit maybe I don't but I gotta call it like I see it the connection status is trash alright the left ear bud keeps going in and out right up my favorite parts of the song the left side disappears and then it comes back on nevertheless let's do some more testing alright so first let's start off with the connection test I'm gonna walk 30 feet and then 50 feet and see if these cut in and out and on the side note I'm a little bit disappointed because the sound quality or NEADS is pretty good alright they're nice and loud mad highs and mids not the most bass heavy but they're super loud and the headphones are comfortable I like them but I can't rock with the no connection but let's put it to the test alright so I'm gonna put hit playing pause let me start what I'll start walking around alright here we go I'm walking away [Music] nope nope Oh New Yorker collective property playing but not believe ha ha all right hold up okay all right now look I walked 30 feet I got a set up I got a set up I got a market so I walked 30 feet and it was fine as soon as I got the 35 feet I was trying to do my 50 feet chest 35 feet it was a rep both of them started cutting in and out then when I got back to 30 came back on I started walking back to the table the left side went out again so I might have a defective pair maybe I do maybe I don't but so far the connection on these trash all right trash sound quality I'm feeling it I'm feeling the sound quality I'm feeling the comfort level but the connection nah nah it's not a go let's keep it moving all right so check this out now if you notice on the bottom it says clips t5 true Wireless right like it's connected to the right side even though it's playing out of both sides so when I go over to my bluetooth menu same thing it says right there's only one clips there's no there's no left side there's only one clips in the menu so when I connect to it the right side is connected then it automatically connects to the left side so I don't know maybe they need to do an update or something but as of right now the connection is real spotty on this one just keep it moving all right so now let's do the one ear blood test can you play music from one side while other side is in the charging case here we go so I got the music playing I'm gonna take out the left side let's drop it in the case close it up okay see it just disconnect it it said ready to pair now let's see if I could pair up the right side okay this clips t5 right I said device paired take it back to the music okay now the right side is connected now I got music come from the right side all right so let's put the left side back in wait for it to connect okay the left side just connect it now I'm gonna take out the right side drop it in the case close it up take just disconnect it waiting okay didn't get anything okay now it's a device paired not just connected to the left let's hit the music okay so the left side is playing so you can play these either a out of town alright so now let's check the button controls one tap on the right side for playing pause okay no problems with that that's also gonna answer and your phone calls okay double tap on the right side to skip to the next zone okay no problems with that long press on the right side to increase your volume okay no problems with that now for the left side one tap by activate your Siri or your Google what's the weather for tomorrow okay no problems with that double tap to reverse tracks okay no problems our debt and long press for volume damn okay no problems with that all the button controls work alright so now let's check the call quality call up my daughter see what it is I just running out of both ears let's get max volume yeah what up what you're doing alright well I'm doing my usual I'm testing out some headphones how do I sell guys sound clear sound good alright let me let me whisper the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog did you hear me oh come on man right in my ear come on bro come on bro yeah I heard that that's the sound quality of your burps I good good good alright well anyway I'm a guy let me wrap this video up yo you know tomorrow night this on we got to get our fits together alright so let's get busy but are we going boom status I guess I was gonna ask you the same thing but I was about to say you not about that bum life alright so listen now let's let's bump it out so this way we could go in and be fat asses yeah I I'm sneaking the Domino's pizza up in there let's get it on alright well I'm going back in a minute all right back ok cool quality or knees it sounded pretty good she said I sounded clear she sounded clear to me but the issue I'm having is while I'm on the phone call same thing the left ear bud is going in and out the right one started cutting out a little bit the Bluetooth connection on this real suspect I call quality sounded good but the connection is just pretty suspect I got to look into that a little bit more let's keep it moving alright so now let's check for lag latency and what I mean by that is when you're watching a video is there any delay from the person's lips to what you hear so I'm just gonna hit play on this I'm gonna watch a little YouTube first and we'll see your the connection on this okay minimum lag maybe just a little fraction of a second not bad at all I could definitely watch a movie like this all day let's try Netflix alright so let me try a little Netflix got some dave chappelle let's see okay Netflix no lag at all this is perfect no the connection no the connection is going in and out again ah let's keep it moving alright so I'm about to rage quit with these earbuds but before I do that I wanted to make sure I covered every base so I just reset my iPhone I disconnected the Bluetooth I repaired them again I'm gonna try to listen to one more song and see if I don't get any cutouts now all through this video all of my testing everything I've been doing they've been cutting in and out so let's try this one last time let's get max volume okay the song started off right I'm gonna just pop my head normally whoo okay now let me move back a little bit okay right now it's running good right now it's running good oh he's sound good though it's really sound good let's give it one minute let's see if you could go one minute without a cutout okay all right all right let me let me pause it hold up okay so I gotta say this the sound quality Ernie's is excellent all right now like I said they're not the most bass heavy in the world if you compare them to some power beats Pro no I the power beats Pro got way more bass these are more of a balanced sound but the volume level these get really loud and they're super comfortable and I already said that but I gotta stress it these are super comfortable you can easily wear these all day my biggest concern is the bluetooth connection now they're supposed to come out with an app for these maybe when they come with that when they'll come out with an update or something I'm in the early stages with these right now the Bluetooth connection is my biggest gripe every test that I did so far while I'm doing the testing in and out so I just reset my phone repaired them again I haven't seen them cut out yet let me pause the video all right because I want to give you out my honest opinion I'm gonna pause the video I'm gonna play ten songs right I'm gonna smoke and play ten songs and by the time I finish I'll let y'all know if they cut in and out one more time here we go alright so overall on a scale of one to ten I cannot cosign these ear buds and I'm gonna tell you why the sound quality is pretty good now if you're looking for loud ear buds these get super loud like volume levels very loud they'll definitely drown out or your outside noise as far as the music crystal clears with the mids and the highs the bass is okay alright it's not super bass if you're looking for super bass you gotta go with the power beats pro but the bass is nice no mud involved I don't really got no complaints with the sound quality and like I said they get very loud the charging case is beautiful I love the stainless steel build I only like the mw7 is a little bit better because they have a little bit more shine to it but I love the charging case USB type-c bluetooth 5.0 so this kind of future-proof battery life eight hours on a single charge 36 hours total that's amazing no lag when you're watching your Netflix videos maybe a fraction of a second when you watch in YouTube but that's nothing you could easily live with that no complaints phone calls they sound pretty good I heard the person out of both ears she heard me fine no qualms with that you can use these one ear but at the time I love that feature but the reason why I can't cosign these hair buds is because of the bluetooth connection the Bluetooth connection is trashed now let me say this I tried every possible fix I paired these up to three different phones same problem I reset the phone reset the air buds deleted them repaired them tried everything I could do I tried all my different music streaming services SoundCloud Apple music Pandora you to read every different music service that I played I had the same problem and one of the main problems is when you switch tracks every time you switch to the next track the air buds cut out now first it was just the left ear but cutting out I reset everything set them up again then the right side started cutting now then every time you start getting comfortable into your music maybe after 2-3 minutes go by you switch songs then it's tough to cut out again and this is me sitting right in front of the table now yeah I see when I did the range test as soon as I passed 30 feet you lost connection so the Bluetooth connectivity on these is trash now clips supposed to come out with an app that's gonna give you access to and eat you and all that maybe they're doing update and fix that connection we'll see as of right now I can't cosign these bodies at your own risk I'm personally gonna keep them because the level of comfort these are definitely one of the most comfortable earbuds on the market I love the comfort feeling these now look these are not advertised as sports earbuds so if you take them to the gym you start doing back flips and all that they're gonna plop out all right they're gonna fall out easily but if you're sitting at your desk you want your earbuds to be super comfortable you're not really moving around I can easily rock these for for 8 hours with no ear fatigue I did super lightweight and they just feel nice and it is I love that little cone shape design that's why I'm kind of disappointed with these because the sound quality and the build and the battery everything is a go except for the Bluetooth connection and that's gonna get on your nerves just trust me all right I'm back here doing my chest in every time I start grooving into one of my songs at my favorite part of the song I'm reciting the lyrics boom it cuts out that's gonna get on your nerves and for 200 bucks you don't want that now you don't want that so I would say if you really like these hold off wait till they come out with an app once they come out with the app I'll do an updated video like I said I can't cosign these I just can't I can't do it I don't want to tell you how to go and get these and I'll be looking at me like I'm trying to sell you got some trash don't do it to yourself wait and I say wait on these or get something else now if you're a big Clips fan and you want to buy these just know that like I said they coming out with an app so maybe in the future they'll fix that let's all go to the clips website and let's all spam them and tell them they need to fix that because the sound quality is worth it like the sound quality would be worth it for 200 bucks anyway clip ste fobs like I said I can't cosign these bodies at your own peril hit me up in the comments let me know what y'all think about these shout out to everybody back with me on Facebook Foursquare with a Google+ shout out to all the Google gangsters I see our holding down that Facebook page shout out to everybody hitting you up on boxer

see you in a second all right so let's first start by talking about what's new with the j-bird x-force and as a forewarning some of this stuff is really minor okay so there are seven things to note first they are now ipx7 certified so that means that you can submerge them down to one meter for 30 minutes so it technically means you can swim with them however bluetooth isn't gonna transmit through water so you can't use these for swimming but they are very water resistance you shouldn't be worried at all with how much you sweat or if you're working out you know near a pool or anything like that or if you work out in the rain you do a lot of running in the rain they are completely water resistant down to one meter for 30 minutes which is awesome but I have to be honest I've not had a single issue related to sweat or water with my X threes or my X twos so it's nice to have I don't think it's wholly necessary though number two they have softer ear fins slash hooks so some people complained that the hooks on the X 3s were a little too pointy a little bit more of a harsh silicon material now they're softer you can see that there's a less material and they're rounded at the edges so they are indeed more comfortable I don't think it's a major upgrade though certainly not you know such an upgrade that it warrants an entirely new model but they are nice number three these silicone ear buds that they come with are now conical in shape as opposed to cylindrical and I can't find any practical reason why they did that to me it doesn't make any difference whatsoever if you look at the ones that came with the X threes and the ones come to X fours I have no idea why they made the change but they did it number four there is a tiny change to the charging cable but it's not even worth mentioning number five they now have a cord cinch as opposed to the traditional cord management clips which I actually quite liked but when they added this guy they got rid of those cable management clips those are like 10 cents I don't know why they didn't keep those in the box with the X fours but now you have this inch instead of the clips and yeah this thing is cool but you've seen it on every single pair of headphones ever so it's not really a feature number six now they technically have a real quick charge feature so it takes ten minutes to get about an hour worth of playback time on the X threes it was about double that so 20 minutes to get an hour worth of playback time number seven they now have jaybird exclusive comply foam ear tips now I really like the foam ear tips I like them on the X threes I really appreciate having them and I those are the ones that I actually use and I would recommend you try those out because they're really good for a number of reasons I can't really notice a difference between the ones that were on the X threes and now the jaybird exclusive ones on the X force but it's cool they kept them and that's it other than that the X fours are the exact same thing as the X threes the same earbud design the same tangle resistant cable the same remote the same mic the same length of the earbuds everything is the same now in my opinion that's not really a bad thing because I really really like the X threes I just think that some of the stuff didn't really warrant jaybird coming out with an entirely new model but that's not up to me so the X 4s are gonna have an MSRP of 130 dollars I'll link them down below in the description that's the same price as what the X 3s retailed for and now naturally the X rays have dropped in price they're about a hundred dollars so me personally I would probably rather get the X threes at a hundred bucks than the X fours at $130 I don't know you let me know down below in the comments I don't think one hundred and thirty dollars is expensive for headphones but if they're almost the exact same thing as 2x threes why not save your money but speaking of saving money that's part of what we do we help people save money on some of the coolest products out there every single day we scour the internet for the best 100 deals we post about them we don't sell the stuff we just alerts you that there are awesome deals out there and we have a completely free iOS and Android mobile app that you can check out the link so those are in the description I can just tell you now though jaybird pops up all the time those beats and the list goes on we save people a ton of money but that's enough talk about business comm now let's get back to the review portion of today's video let's start with the design of the X fours the X fours have a tangle resistant cable as I mentioned before which is pretty standard nowadays they do have that cord cinch as I mentioned before that's to shorten up the cable but I personally do really miss having those cable management clips those were kind of the linchpin and being able to wear them in the over ear position which is the more sporty position those allowed you to string the cable up up against the back of your head so when you went running or did some intense workout it didn't bounce all over the place with the cord management cinch it works but it doesn't work as well as those clips and if you take a look at this thing it's like it calling all rat tail fans basically it you'd have a little rat tail at the end of it and it doesn't really bounce all that much but sometimes if you don't cinch it down properly you can get this thing just going all over the place which can be very annoying so yeah I like having this inch but I wish they would have just thrown in the 2 cent cable management clips as well now the X 4 is also have a full remote and an inline mic the remote is pretty standard I'll link the manual down below in the description so you can read up on the exact controls it's the same as the x rays and many other headphones the X 4s are also going to work with Siri Google assistance and they'll work for calls on top of that as for the earbuds themselves they have a pretty minimal size and are sort of contoured to fit comfortably in your ear again I've used the X 3s for two years now I think they're really comfortable and I like the way they fit in your ear by default and jaybird is going to have the medium size that your fins and your tips on the x 4's but they also offer other sizes in the box so you can find the right fit for your ear keep in mind though that the ear fins are angled to lock in place in your ear so there is an actual right and left designated side so you can't just put any ear fin on any earbud you have to put the right one on the right one and the left one on the left one that's how you get the best fit as for overall durability well it's going to be pretty dang good no issues with them breaking no issues with them being damaged although I don't exactly know how you're gonna use them they are as I mentioned before ipx7 certified which you won't see on hardly any other headphones out there so they are definitely good to go around water around sweat and urine it has to be official and it has to be urine but how do they x4 sound the answer is very good they're a little flat out of the box but that's on purpose and I'll explain that here in a second they have great passive noise isolation which means that when you put them in your ear you can't really hear things around you which is probably the reason I'm talking a little loud right now but you can't cure everything around you which is great for the gym right you don't want to hear that guy over there grunting all day long when he's doing deadlifts you know guy I'm talking about he comes in there with his girlfriend he stays on the deadlift squat rack area and he's there for like an hour and he does three reps that guy and he groans and grunts all the time yeah you won't have to hear him which is pretty awesome but the sound isolation is a double-edged sword while it's great for the gym it's not so great for running especially if you're running in an urban environment now they do a good job of canceling out the wind noise because you have such good passive noise isolation but if you're in an urban environment like New York or you know something like that you want to be able to hear some of the ambient noise around you as like a safety precaution so you don't get hit by a car and really with the x-force there are no great solution for allowing and more sound I guess you could take one of the earbuds out kind of like put it down your shirt but yeah there's just not going to be great for running in super urban environments or on train tracks now the actual sound preferences themselves are adjustable with an app we saw this I think first show up on the j-bird freedoms then the x3 then the run then the freedom - and now the x4 so they have an accompanying app where you can jump in there and you can adjust the entire spectrum of the EQ so you can add more bass take away from the bass add more mids take away from the mids highs all that stuff which is actually really great so if you like this a country-music you can customize the x4 to sound how you want them to sound to sound best for that genre of music and not only can you customize the EQ yourself but you can find different presets for different types of music so I customized one it was called get to it and that's the one I use for when I'm playing I think it's mostly country music that I play so that's the one that sounds best for me for country music but there are plenty of other ones to choose from from professional athletes from jaybird and just other people that have customized their own EQ which is really awesome there aren't that many headphones out there that also have this feature so if you do get the exports make sure to download that jaybird app and to kind of play around the sound settings now one other thing in that jaybird app is a find my buds feature which allows you to see where you last pair the x4 s to your Bluetooth device so that way you know if you lose them you can find them obviously that's not a perfect solution but it is kind of clever and it may come in handy every once in a while now for the Bluetooth range it is about 50 feet that is with a clear line-of-sight and indoors I'm able to walk around our office pretty much no problem once I get past that 50 foot threshold though there is some disruptions to the signal and just as a little tip if you keep the remote facing your Bluetooth device you'll get a even longer signal so you can go 75 feet 100 feet but the second you turn around it'll cut into that signal but still 50 feet it's actually really nice I said this in another video but I can go take a whiz and the music doesn't even cut out which is great now for battery life they have about 9 hours of battery life on a single charge that's our test that's a little bit more than jaybird says they'll do they say about 8 hours but from what I've been seeing it's about 9 hours which is pretty good it's not way above average but I guess it would be kind of seven eight hours for wireless headphones and these are these are pretty good plus they have that quick charge feature so as for the verdict on the X fours yes I really do like them I don't think some of the changes we're as dramatic as jaybird is gonna say they are but they're really good headphones that I've enjoyed testing them I personally am just going to keep my x3 I like them I love them actually and I use them every single day so I'll probably just give these to one of the guys here on the team let me know what you think though I'd love to hear your comments down below but be a little respectful because we've had some mean people lately and I don't like that I don't like it at all I have a great day [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

x,2020-10-07 10:22:46.312431, [Music] [Applause] so a few months back we did a video for you guys on Astros new at the time 810 headphones in fact I think you could probably see the link to that piece that we did right up there now the eight ends were a big deal for a couple of reasons number one it's always a big deal when a company like Astra which has been one of the premier of names and gaming headsets for a long time it's always a big deal when they put out a new headphone everyone wants to know about it see what it's like in all the specs but it was a big deal for another reason as well and that's because it was the first time Astro had a headphone that was priced under $100 in fact the headphone itself was $60 that that wouldn't be a big deal on its own if it wasn't any good but the fact is it's a great headphone people love it to this day people still love the a-10 it's selling really well and a lot of gamers are really happy that they can have the Astro experience at a really really reasonable price point there a lot of you out there that still wanted more you're saying hey I like a wireless gaming headphone and I'd like to be priced lower than the $2.99 that we have to spend for the a 50 Astros flagship wireless headphone well guess what Astra was listening they probably had this in the works for a while and now for everyone that wanted a less expensive but still Astro quality wireless headphone experience the a20 wireless headphone so of course we're going to unbox this and share all of its little secrets with you but before that lame unboxing knife come on you knew it was coming I always have to do it all right now while I'm unboxing the 820 Wireless let me talk a little bit a big picture about this headphone of course it features the same great astro build quality that all their headphones are known for which is amazing because this particular headphone the wireless 820 only cost 149 dollars but you're still getting that great bill that great quality build that Astra was known for it also promises 15 hours of battery life which is a really big deal because if the battery runs out to you quickly you don't want to have to stop your gaming experience to go plug it in wait for it to charge 15 hours of gameplay should be plenty for all of you if you're getting more than 15 hours at a time you probably have a problem and you talk to somebody I'm just trying to make sure you're being healthy the other thing that I thought was really interesting is as I sort of open up the one flap that closes this whole thing when I spoke with fattiest Cooper over at Astro we were talking about all this features of this headphone had he was listening off some bullet points you know all the great features then he said then of course it has all the usual stuff like you know the flip up mic to boom mic that'll mute it and of course the equalizer the EQ that allows you to do preset EQ and you know it allows you to balance the chat between game chat and voice chat all the normal stuff and I have to laugh and I have to stop and I was like you know what that may be normal for Astro headphones but that's not normal for the for all the other headphones these are features that are only normal if you're used to getting Astro headphones these are things that Astro puts in all their new headphones that the competitors still haven't caught up with so I love the fact that Astro sort of was downplaying all the really cool features that you don't really get other headphones but of course you're gonna get them at the Astro so those are all here as well you have the boom mic that flips up to mute you have the EQ you can also use Astros command center which will allow you to really customize the sound and it'll even allow you to customise the microphone input so people are having trouble hearing you or if they're hearing you too loudly you can adjust the volume they're all through software so look what I did okay so out of the box here's what you're greeted with there are two different versions of the Astro 820 wireless headphones there's one that is meant for the PlayStation 4 and there's one that is meant for the Xbox one and I mean the entire Xbox one family of consoles the vs the standard and of course the upcoming Xbox one X can't wait for that to come out now the nice thing is regardless of which model you get the one designed for the PlayStation 4 or the Xbox one both of those models are going to be compatible with PC and Mac as well so these can be headphones for your home console and your computer at the same time here right off the top we see a cable or 2 to 2 cables micro USB cables one a little longer than the other and I assume when we open this up there we go and right off the bat I can tell you they're nice and light I think when you work when you when you get a wireless headphone you worried that of course all the technology has to be built in the wireless receiver and everything that goes along with that you're worried about it weighing down the headphones these are not heavy at all these are nice and light but as I said earlier they still have that Astro quality of build hopefully you can get a good look here that matte black finish and that classic of course I have the Xbox one edition and you can see the little green on the inside the microphone has a little plastic cover and the microphone you can see is nice and flexible now on the side here you see there is a little red tab I'm going to pull that off and on the side here look at this we have the different okay there's a master volume control here there's a little roller wheel right on the bottom corner here that controls the master volume of the headphone and here you'll see a little rocker around either side of the master volume switch and that rocker will allow you to balance the audio when you're gaming if you want to hear more if you're playing online with your friends and family and you want to hear more of the chat you can press the button to go more towards chat if you want to hear more in-game sounds and ingame volume you can hit that as well so that's another one of the things that a strobe does that they think is normal but it's not normal it's a really cool feature and something that all Astro head phones now have okay so moving up from where the master volume is and then where the little rocker switch is to adjust chat versus game audio you'll see two buttons here on the side and it looks like a little LED light one of them on the top is for power the one right below right here is actually to adjust the different pre pre-done eq's that they have they have a few settings that you can choose from at the beginning to sort of tailor the sound to your liking but again you can go into their software a command center and fully to me audio however you like but it's nicer they have some preset eq's as well and in terms of the buttons that is pretty much it it has you can tell it's built on these sliders you can see how the slider sort of works up and down works pretty smoothly a little rubberized insert on the headband here that's very very comfortable or feels very very comfortable let me see for myself it's very very comfortable these are really really comfortable and very adjustable yeah I've said this a million times and different and different in different reviews for headphones you can have the greatest headphone in the world with all the greatest features you could ever want but if it isn't comfortable you're not going to wear it long enough to appreciate all those features so comfort is something that astro also puts right up there with their legendary sound quality now I have tested the sound of these off-camera I don't want to sit here and have me have the headphones on and listen and have you watch me do that sound quality is excellent but really would you expect anything less from astro I'm just blown away you get the great sound quality great build all the great features for pretty much half the price of the a 50 I think that's I think that's amazing and I don't know how quite how they do that okay so let's put the headphone itself down for a second because there is something that makes all the magic happen in terms of the wireless experience and that is the little bass here that are now taking oh it's so small look at how tiny this thing is this is the bass okay so moving from left to right on this you have a little toggle switch right here and that toggle switch will allow you to switch it between PC mode and Xbox mode depending on how you're using it then in the middle there is a classic USB port and that actually is going to allow you to plug this USB cable into this and then charge your 820 headphones then you have a optical port yes yeah digital audio port right there optical audio port right there and that's gonna get the sound from your Xbox into the module and then send it to your 8:28 wireless headphone and then on the very back you will see a micro USB input there's gonna be a typical again a USB cable from your Xbox that goes into the micro USB input here that will give this whole unit power so that should pretty much explain how the Box works and of course all the cables are included the optical audio cable is right here and of course the two micro USB cables here now some of you may be wondering okay what's the difference between this and the big Daddy you know it's big brother the a 50 wireless headphone again which is $300 versus this one which is 149 dollars I happen to have the a 50 here and I'll kind of show you first off you can see there's a slight design ethic difference as great as durable as they are these are you'll see these have a little bit of a better build quality to them only because you have you'll see the the aluminum piping here of course in classic Xbox green you'll have the aluminum piping the headset has built a little differently they have the Tempurpedic foam on the headpiece instead of the rubberized material that's on the a20 so there are some differences the build quality is going to be a little better on this one and of course wouldn't you expect a 150 dollar headphone versus a three hundred dollar headphone like this there are going to be some differences in terms of the sound you're still getting great sound on the a20 just a little bit different build quality on this one also on the 850 you'll see the u number I told you about the rocker switch on the 820 that adjusts in game chat versus game audio well this does it on the earpiece so a little bit different technology build a little bit fancier on the a 50 the other main difference between the a 50 and the a 20 is while you have to charge the a 20 through this little box and the micro USB cable that I just showed you the a 50 actually has this which along with being larger calls so acts as a cradle which this guy just sits in and charges using the contact points on the bottom because he has little contact points down there so you don't to worry about plugging the sky and just when you're done gaming this gets seated right on here and automatically charges waiting for your next gaming session if you can deal with the fact that the game audio adjustment is in a different position you actually have to plug it in instead of sitting it on its base to get its charge if you can deal with a a still beautifully made and very comfortable headphone but not quite as fancy as the a 50 if you can deal with those differences you can save $150 by getting this headphone or for people that are on a budget that can't afford a $300 headphone 149 dollar headphone of this quality with this great sound is is sort of a huge win for gamers everywhere so if you like hearing about

of top tech guys if you like these videos don't forget to hit that subscribe button with the bell notification icon so that you get notified each time we upload a new top tech video let's jump into the first product first product we're checking out are the car cool tws earphones now these are bluetooth 5 earphones and they are priced in at eighteen ninety-nine they're available in two colors we've got the blue color over here and they are the more traditional airport style design where in which they do have a long stem but they do have any style earphones so you do have replaceable ear tips that do come with the package now like I mentioned these earphones have bluetooth 5.0 so they will connect with all your latest audio devices along with your smartphones that do support 5.2 oh and now they deliver a good amount of bass as well as mid-range then not the brightest earphones but if you like something which is bass heavy these are definitely it they're also extremely loud so if you want a lot of audio from your earphones these ones will deliver they do have a wireless touch controls as well and you can use them outdoors as well as during workouts they are IP xx water resistant and sweat resistant as well the good thing about these earphones is that they do offer up about a five-hour usage time and then you can charge up the earphones in the case that comes with it up to three times fully which is brilliant so it is a good combination giving you a total of 20 hours of usage in one single charge of the case and the earphones they fit in the ear quite well they're really comfortable to wear for long periods of time and you can also call in Siri or Google assistant directly from these earphones as well because they do suppose that feature all in all a really good pair for the price like I said they are available in two colors go check these out if you are looking for something that's really nice and heavy in the bass Department next up are the over base earphones they're priced at 2000 P is also available in a bunch of colors these are a more subtle design they sit inside the ear we did get them in the red color which is not so subtle they do have bluetooth v dot o but the charging case has 600 milliamp hours as a so once you fully charge the earphones you can use them for five hours and then charge them upwards of five times in the case are giving you a total of 30 hours of usage which is brilliant it does work with Google assistant city or even alexa they do sit inside the ear they are IPX five water-resistant the audio profile is sort of flat not a lot of bass going on with these they do come with additional ear tips as well so you can swap those out get a better fit although they sit inside the ear quite securely so you won't have any issues no matter what the shape or the size of your ear is go check these out if you are looking for a more flat audio profile that you can tweak in your equalizer and get a better audio sample but these do offer up a flat audio profile they are loud enough as well so you do get a lot of volume next up are the air buds now these are one of the best fitting out of the lot priced in add a 1699 these are available only in the black color a really good shape and design and replaceable ear tips as well and they also come with these little winglets that sit inside your ear and make the earphones much more secure they pair up with each other automatically they offer up up to five hours of usage on a full charge and then you can charge the earphones a couple of times giving you upwards of 20 to 22 hours of usage time audio profile is really good really well balanced they sound good the volume is also good the microphone is also nice to pick up the audio so all in all a pretty well-balanced package and one of the best fitting ones so if you are using this for an active workout or something they will definitely stay in your ear much longer go check these out next up on our list are the xm8 gusto these are $17.99 again truly wireless in-ear style earphones they also have bluetooth 5 dot oh they do come with replaceable ear tips as well now these are extremely compact and do have touch controls on the earphones you can also call in your assistance as well they take about 1.5 hours to fully charge and each earphone has a 50 ml amp hour battery which gives it about 3 to 4 hours of music as well as talk time so if you are using these 4 calls as well will get about 3 to 4 hours it also comes with a 400 milliamp hour charging case so it does give you additional battery as well inside the case so you can use them upwards of three to four times fully charged from the case as well now one of the coolest things about these earphones is that the case also has an LCD display that constantly gives you the level of battery left inside the case which is really handy for when you are charging or if you are just about to leave you can quickly check the battery life in the case as well which is really useful and helpful if you are planning on using these earphones they pair up automatically with each other and then you can connect them with several devices because they are bluetooth 5.0 they have really good sound with good amounts of bass as well and then you do have the bass controls on each of these earphones as well so if you can enable a higher base if you want or you can reduce the bass these are extremely lightweight and fit comfortably in the ear and you don't feel them in your ear for longer periods of time so brilliant little earphones go check these out and they're priced quite well as well now the final product on our list are the porter Onix harmonics and even though the name rhymes are these are pretty interesting earphones available again in a few colors we've got the really nice looking green color over here they are available for rupees $17.99 and again Bluetooth five dot oh really compact really nice fit really good design as well buttons on both of these earphones to receive calls if that's something that you want or even pause or play the music they do have smaller batteries so they do have a 40 milliamp hour battery inbuilt and about 320 milliamp hour battery and at the case so you get about 3 hours of usage on the earphones so definitely lesser battery but it's a really nice fit now because it uses bluetooth v Low Energy you do get a decent amount of standby time as well they're not going to give you the maximum battery life so definitely if you want a longer range earphone these will not give you the maximum amount of battery life they are really well made are they are soft materials as well and they offer up a really good sound profile and they work really well with phone calls so the mic and the earpiece are really good on these as well now we tried all of these wireless earphones on gaming with pub G we tried it on the oneplus 70 Pro and all of these devices work perfectly fine with pop G all of them are on Bluetooth 5 dot also connectivity speed seems to be consistent across the board so no problem with any of those and that's it for this video guys if you liked it

video talking about a headset I've already talked about and the reason I'm doing the video is because Sony just released the PlayStation Gold wireless headset in white and I thought it deserved its own video so this isn't gonna be a full-on review like the other one was if you are interested in that there will be a link below but I thought we should check out the PlayStation going and white just to see what it looks like just kind of bring up the review again maybe touch on a few points that I didn't touch on before but first off let's go ahead and check to see what's in the box alright so inside the box it does come with the wireless USB dongle because that is how it transmits its audio without this you cannot use it in Wireless mode and to be able to use that they need to be charged which you're able to do with the micro USB charging cable that it's included with but battery life really is only about seven or eight hours so that is nothing special here but if you do want to use them wired or your battery runs out you're able to by using this three-and-a-half millimeter cable which is also included these do retail for $100 now the black ones also retail for 100 but you can find them on sale usually about 70 to 79 dollars somewhere in that range so the white ones I haven't seen on sale there well they're new and they retail for hundreds so right now you're gonna pay about 20 extra dollars just for the color but speaking of the color this is the white headset and to me the first thing I thought of is almost immediately upon picking up this thing is gonna have fingerprints it's gonna get dirty especially like if you wear stuff in your hair or anything like that it won't take long for these to get dirty and they sit and they fit they're basically the well they are the exact same headset as the black one so as far as features these do have 7.1 surround sound build quality on these are improved upon the first gen like said in the review these do not fold inward like the original ones did because they had a lot of problems with the hinges and the headband cracking as to wear with these they are very bendable very twistable build quality is so much better in the newer version the ear cups still have that angled look again with the 7.1 that's pretty important because position of the driver's inside of the ear cups have a lot to do to giving you a better surround sound feel your cups are soft there's not a whole lot of depth to them so if you have smaller ears you may experience touching the inside part and it may irritate your ears now but inside the headband right behind the ear cups is where you'll see your left and right all of your controls are on the left ear cup at the bottom you have your micro USB port to charge your headphone jack behind it you have your mute button for the mic you have your volume up and your volume down and then you have your virtual surround sound button now moving along to the front you'll see where the indicator light is at and your built-in microphone this does not have a boom mic it has a built-in mic and then you have your off one and two because you're able to put different sound profiles by using the app onto the headset itself and then above that you have the rocker to adjust how much sound of the game you want and how much of the chat that you want basically so you can balance it out and hear yourself at the same time with mic monitoring the headphones adjust by sliding up and down inside the headband and they also have a little bit of wiggle room to kind of position and get comfortable on your ears the way you need them to be now speaking about the microphone that is one of the weak points in the PlayStation Gold headset in my opinion as far as the look goes I really do prefer this white and gray model over the original black I think it just has a classier clean look the fact that the ear cups are grey and the PlayStation logo is grey kind of breaks up the white a little bit right around the edges where all of your controls is it's about the only spot that there's a gloss so you don't have to worry about fingerprints but on white it's kind of harder to see fingerprints anyway on the outside of the ear cup is more of a textured kind of a matte finish definitely not picking up fingerprints so I think for the most part it will stay clean I just think the headband and the ear cups are probably more than more likely to show like dirt and pick up on stuff easily so if you're gonna get this model this isn't one that I would really recommend like traveling and throwing in a bag because it's gonna pick up everything alright so sound sound on these are actually really good they're fun and exciting to me they have a lot of impact but they're really clean and the 7.1 surround sound even though it's gimmicky in certain things it can add space in the sound in the fact that Sony has a bunch of different profiles set up inside the headphone companion app that you download on the PlayStation they have a lot of audio profiles that are set up for a bunch of different games that way you don't have to really play around with the profile as much now with music this also sounds really good I'm using it Wireless on a PC if you don't want to use it Wireless on the ps4 so it does have some versatility and the fact that you can use it wired with anything that actually still uses a headphone jack I will say if you're not a PlayStation 4 owner I wouldn't recommend these too much but mainly because the mics not back great and it just kind of feels limited or it just feels specialized for the PlayStation but they are Playstation headsets so kind of what you would expect so guys that is my quick video of the brand-new white PlayStation Gold headset like I said it's not a full-on review but if you are interested in a full on review there is a link below so thank you guys so much for checking out this video thank you guys so much for checking out all the other videos and as always guys make sure to stay tuned for more
211,FeaosK-pk8s,cowtc,UCqYYsRuH6LiV6qvwRGwZBlA,JBL Tune 600 BT ANC Wireless Headphones - Beats killer?,"Unboxing and review of these almost unknown Active Noise Cancelling on-ear headphones from JBL (Harman)

Some extra points not mentioned in video:
- Sound quality is much better with ANC on rather than off
- Doesn't come with carry pouch
- They are nice ear warmers in cold environments due being fairly tight on the head
- They sound equally as good in wired mode
- The aux cable is custom fit to these headphone (don't lose them!)
- You can switch on noise cancelling when connected by wire",24,121481,169.0,673.0,217.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FeaosK-pk8s/hqdefault.jpg,Beats|solo|wireless|JBL|harman|kardon|tune600|bluetooth|bass|active noise|cancellation|sony|xb|headphones|earphones|in-ear|noise|cancelling|review|unbox|unboxing|jimsreviewroom,2020-10-07 10:22:46.312540, [Applause] [Music] hey guys welcome to another unboxing video today we have another wireless headphone so these are the JPL tune 600 so some of the other features is that this comes with a detachable aux cable it's foldable and you can take phone calls on it and the battery life here with a different noise cancelling on its 12 hours you switched off it can last for 22 hours so ox cable it's quite interesting charge cable is very short mainly made of plastic you see shiny plastic on here but it does look quite nice they order JBL they all logo the actual headband is made of the same material as the pads here it's kind of like a felt type material I've seen this on material on some Sony headphones it's comfortable but I think these may not last as long as the leather type materials so let's do a quick weight comparison with the beat solo dream so you can see there one seven seven grams these are the beats so you see the beats are 216 117 grams so the JPL's are a fair bit lighter just quick side-by-side comparison with the beats these are the JBL's side switch these on you just simply press and hold the power button here you you can see there's two lights here a blue light meaning the actual headsets on or off and a white light meaning the noise cancellation whether that's on and off so switch the noise cancellation on and off you can just hold down this button that turns noise cancellation off back on again interesting feature of this headphones is that it does not auto switch off so you can use these headphones whilst on a plane or bus or train just for active noise cancellation without even listening to music so we also have the aux socket here and volume up and down here of a mode button in the middle if you hold down the plus or minus buttons they all skip or go to previous track the charge is here the microUSB as you can see you cannot use these mods charging it so the other size of the ear cups have nothing at all no buttons so one of the things I notice is that lights on here pretty bright actually so how's the noise cancellation on these headphones after using it for a trip on a plane and commuting a bit these noise cancellation is actually very good especially for the price I would say this is about two thirds of what the Bose quiet comfort noise cancellation features are so some of the negatives about these headphones is that this felt tight material on the ears they cause your ears to warm up and no doubt will sweat if you wear these for prolonged periods also the materialists headphones are made off it's all plastic the headband being matte black can't scuff quite easily and the shiny parts on the ear cups also can get scuffed quite easily - so how did these headphones sound they actually sound very very good especially for the price they are on par with the sony xba-4 compared with the beats solo free these do not have as good detail in the mids and highs definitely not as good however the bass on these are really good really really good they actually are better than the beats the beats are punchy bass but these actually have powerful bass at the low end so they really bring out songs so some quality wise they are on par with the sony xba-40 so if you have a choice between the two is up to you I would say the Sony's probably would sound slightly better than these in that their mid and high highs will be slightly more detailed than these however these have active noise cancellation which the xB 650s do not have and the design of these are a lot nicer a lot smaller and compact so in my opinion older I would go for these over the Sony's unless you really value the sound now would I buy these over there beats solo freeze well as a bass lover I would say yes because the even though the mids and highs are not as detailed as their beats the bass actually makes up for it like I said it brings out the songs and just gives you more satisfaction when listening to Basie songs it's also it has active noise cancellation which the beasts do not have and this is like half the price of the beasts so in my opinion I think these are really worth it and for try I fully recommend these anyway guys I see you in a next video bye [Music]

214,Pw8qJJXF6KE,Digital Trends,UC8wXC0ZCfGt3HaVLy_fdTQw,Bang & Olufsen H7 Wireless Headphones - Review,"When you put the H7 on, it’s impossible not to feel like you’re wearing a premium piece of headgear. Though we were concerned a serious lack of headband padding might result in uncomfortable wear right off the bat, we were pleased to find out the H7 pair just the right amount of clamping force with squishy enough earpads that very little of the headphones’ 9.9 oz. weight is exerted on the wearer’s crown — it takes a good two hours or so before you’ll want to take a break.

The BeoPlay H7 come with touch controls embedded in the metal surface of their right earcup. Using a simple swipe of the finger, listeners can advance or back up a track, pause and play, answer and disconnect phone calls. Using a swirling motion, users can also adjust volume up or down, much like turning the volume dial on amplifier.

wireless headphones|motorola wireless headphones review|wireless earbuds review|motorola verve buds|motorola verve headphones|motorola verve headphones review,2020-10-07 10:22:46.312631, hey everybody I'm here today to do a review of these Motorola Verve buds 500 these are wireless earbuds and they're absolutely awesome and in this video review I'll be going over the features and functions with you as you can see they actually have this convenient and awesome carrying case and charging case so you can basically charge the charging case and then store the earbuds in the charging case and allow them to charge up while on the go and it also allows you to keep them together nice and easily I'm gonna actually just remove them from the charging case and they're very very easy and convenient to remove and place in there and I'll show you the actual earbuds as you can see right here the first thing that I want to go over is the design of the earbuds they're absolutely awesome I mean with regards to how easy they are to use they are so easy to setup and incredibly easy to use they have this convenient multifunction button down here at the bottom that can be used for different things so right now I'm just going to shut this one off by holding it down and you can see there's just basically one button on each of the earbuds and it's used for a wide variety of purposes now they're lightweight and they are so sleek and gorgeous if you take a look at them like they're just they have this all black design this pair right here the Motorola logo on the side one multifunction button at the bottom and these earbuds right here and then these little charging parts right over here in addition to the earbuds themselves you also receive a variety of sizes for the fittings so that means that you can actually use these to fit your ear properly so right now I have the medium ones inside of there and they work well for me but you know they have extra small small medium large and extra large you can pretty much get whichever one fits your ear the best and it also has this nice charging cable and I like this charging cable because it's relatively short so you're not gonna have a crazy amount of cable left over and you also don't need to charge them that often because they have a great battery life and also you have the charging case so that's why in my opinion the short cable is best for these specific earbuds now in addition to looking amazing feeling amazing and being really easy to set up and use they're also great for everything basically for listening to music making calls or taking calls I mean if you want a pair of wireless earbuds that will allow you to be very versatile then these are the ones for you and their cost is incredible you get an amazing value for the price that you're paying now here's one of the best features of these earbuds in my opinion you can use either of the earbuds as a mono Bluetooth headset so that means that if you want to preserve the battery life you can use this earbud until the battery dies as a mono bluetooth headset then you can use this ear button as a mono bluetooth headset that means you can basically double the length of time that you can use these for if you're using them as a as a mono Bluetooth headset so only one in each ear now like I said the size is absolutely perfect because they're not too small but they're also not too large I've seen wireless earbuds that are really small and they're great because they easily fit in your ears and they're super lightweight but they can be easily lost these ones are the perfect size they're not too small so you can always keep track of them but they're not too big so they're not gonna weigh you down or really part rude out of your ear they're just in my opinion the absolute perfect size now when I was wearing them they were unbelievably comfortable the quality of sound that they produced for both listening to music and for making calls and taking calls was incredible it was a great volume just enough and like I said you feel if I wanted to sort of listen to music loudly and sort of rock out and jam out they worked well for that if I wanted to make a call or take a call with a relatively low volume they worked well for that now just before I finish off I want to show you this is the case right here watch how easily they can be placed in the case sort of feels magnetized like I placed them down and it sort of feels like a magnetic little powers bringing them in place just like that so they're easily placed in there you can close up the case when you open it up you see the battery life of the charging case see what's going on with the headphones I mean they're really really really can and really easy-to-use just like that very simple very simple design and that's basically it in this video I just wanted to do a review of these Motorola Verve earbuds 500 if you liked this video be sure to give it a thumbs up let me know what you

other headphones so in this video I will try to compare the two major competitors inside the two thousand rupee price bracket and that would be the booth over 600 on the blue dial T 2 plus so let's get straight into it is you two before starting with the review many of you guys asked meaning to submit an entry for the take create round have so made the entry on if you guys want to see you can go up to my Instagram account and watch it there because there isn't allow it to make public on YouTube so that's what I've been really disappointed by the headphone on your phone to use done by Q tubers do this because they don't portray an accurate description of how the headphone or your phone actually is and that could be because they only tested with like a simple set of music or they are biased towards some kind of music so just for an example I bought these Audio Technica CLR 100 by watching it reviews on youtube so if you're watching this video on the Audio Technica CLR 100 you will not be able to differentiate between this and this because these headphones have almost no bass in them and not many people who review these headphones will tell you about that so we'll jump on with audio quality straight away when it comes to volume the brooder t2 plus is like really really loud I have never used any headphones louder than the blue diode t21 but they can also tend to distort a bit on the higher volume but for the most part the volume is quite good the volume on the board rockers is not as loud as the blue dial 1 but it is also decently loud one thing to note in common between these two when you connect any of these using an aux cable to your mobile or your computer the volume and audio quality will decrease a bit and I think that's common with most wireless headphones so I will try to compare the mid highs and lows of these two headphones the highs are not that clear on the blue dye ot twos and they kind of mix with the mid-tones a lot on the boot rockers the highs are not very overpowering but they are not under powering at the same time they are very natural sounding the mids are good on both these but I feel that on the Blue Devil ones they kind of mix the delusion eyes on the boat rockers the mates are very natural just like the highs and lows and they don't tend to mix with each other so if you're using your headphones to listen to instrumental music or jazz you have to go for the boat rockers because I have to say instrumental music doesn't sound good at all on the Blue Devil but when you talk about lose or be saving music the Blue Devil ones have absolutely killer loud bass that will definitely vibrate your ears the bass is loud and overpowering but it's not segregated and can feel a bit muddy on the board rock is one also the bass is very good but not as overpowering has on the blue that one's so if you're going for rap music or bass heavy music is consulting only the audio the blue dial one should be the first choice however if you listen to all kinds of music and want to natural highs I met audio or you are doing some kind of sound production work then you should definitely go for the board rockers so if I want to sum it up the blue dial ones have a very base heavy punchy feel to it and on the other hand you have a very soothing and natural experience from the board Roxas so I have to give props for both of the companies for being very realistic with the battery because it says v8 hours on the cover on the boot up is one and it actually has eight hours while using it it generally lasts me around three to four days on an average use on the other hand the blue dial ones have an insane battery life it walks up to 40 hours on a full charge you can easily go two weeks without charging these so Before we jump on to the build quality uncomfort of these headphones you can click on the subscribe button because I keep making content like this if you guys have ever used headphones you will know that the build quality and comfort of EDD phones is very important and if you can't wear headphones for more than half an hour the headphones are quite useless the build quality on the blue die ones feels very cheap it's all plastic on the material used is also not a very good quality when you touch or try to twist the headband Aldus cop you can feel that it is very cheap quality plastic and it has some kind of a cardboard or very cheap quality plastic material covering it up also it has big turbine written on the headband and you seriously have a lot of grinding on these headphones so when you get to the ways in spite of being plastic they are a bit heavy but they're not too heavy and I would any day prefer 40 hours of battery life over a little bit of it however the material used on the ear cups and the one on the headband is synthetic and it's not very comfortable and on the website it says that the headphones are over the year and most people feel that these are on your headphones but I'm having me do sizes on the kind of fit in between and that's the worst fit that you can have the headphones don't cover your folio and the kind of set at the edge of your ears that is very uncomfortable also your ears start touching the material inside the form that is also synthetic and is we using at all I'll be quite honest all you what it is quite good but I can't wear these headphones along the buttons however are quite good and you can easily make out between the volume buttons on the buttons to change no zip you also get some nifty features with this iPhone like you can connect another headphone to the 3.5 mm jack when these headphones are connected by a brutal when it comes to comfort the boot rockers are like with different spectrum as compared to the brooder ones because they are very comfortable and the quality of material used is also quite good these have light source large styles on the ear build the material used on the cushions on the hip and a synthetic but it's quite comfortable these are also very tight so sometimes you won't even see that they're on air use the quality of materials used on the both rockers I'll be a better this diffuse off to use but because of the metal on the good quality plastic we also feed studying the harnesses the buttons are also quite intuitive on URM on the right side the both rope is one seat decently premium for the price I don't know how many of you guys might be using the mic on these one but have to say that the mic on the blue that I want is good but is not as good as the one on the board rockers the connectivity on both of these is quite good and we have about 7 meters to 8 meters of range so the best buy links will be in the description box below and let me know if you like these kind of review videos or not by

exactly how these headphones work how to operate them and these headphones have a lot of features so I don't to spend too much time so let's get going here with the first feature here I start out here with the left ya piece we have here on the bottom we have two micro USB charging port and these headphones come with these micro USB charging cable and in order to charge these headphones you just plug this in here and then as soon as you've done this you will see here this tiny red LED is going to light up that means it's charging and in case this LED turns off that means that the battery is fully charged and then you can unplug the cable again and in case when you're using this here and it's the red light here is blinking that means that the battery is low and you should plug this in soon okay so in case you need some more information then I have this video here in the upper right corner you may want to try that out check that out for more information about the charging process okay so now let me unplug this here for a while and now we keep going here so now we take a look at the right earpiece yeah at the very top here we have the on/off switch and we're going to push this up just for a little bit you see it starts blinking and now here this LED here turns blue immediately that means that it is already connected here to my iPhone here in this case and in case you need assistance with how to connect this to your smartphone then I recommend this other video here in the upper right corner this shows you exactly how to do that in detail so now let's keep going so we had the on/off button and then we have here the plus button this is two raise the volume let me show you this by just playing some music here okay so let me demonstrate so we just push the plus button on this case the volume is already at the top it's the loudest already so let me use the minus button first to lower the volume and then raise the volume with the plus button now if we press and hold this button here for two seconds the plus button that is then it's going to go to the next audio track and if we press and hold the minus button for two seconds we're going to go to the previous track so let me show you this really quick see now we just changed the track here and now here in the middle rear of another button this is here the play and pause button see push this once and it pauses you push it again and it plays again now in case you get a phone call then you can make a phone call you can take pick up this phone call with these headphones and in case when it's ringing and you

button can enable Siri and I do this by just pressing this button twice see this here okay so now let's keep going down here we have here this auxiliary port and the headphones come with this this extra cable that you can use so you can plug in the small connector into these headphones and then connect this here the other end to your smartphone in case your battery here off your headphones is empty then you can still keep using the headphones just with this cable here and then the other button that we have here this is here the active noise-cancelling button so if you don't need active noise-cancelling then you can turn this off here by just pressing it once and by doing it that way then you can save some energy here so your battery life will be longer okay and then also these headphones do support google assist and Alexa and you do this by touching here the left the outside of the left earpiece you just touch this and you activate those services by first installing here

is a demonstration of the RS 195 and its features and settings the RS 195 offers unique features unprecedented from Sennheiser because for the first time in a wireless headphone the sub can be individually tailored to the listeners needs in this video we will explain the technology at work here for this we'll assume the system is connected to a TV or other source if you cannot see that an LED is lit up no hearing Boost has been activated and the RS 195 is basically just a regular wireless headphone let's start setting it up first the TV needs to be turned on and set to a program where there's dialogue or just human speech in it this will help you best hear the improvements in speech intelligibility when switching through the profiles so make sure the TV is running and set to a suitable program also make sure the headphones volume is up try the buttons to see where the level is set first the balance we recommend for this to be set first if the listener prefers one side louder than the other this should be step 1 let's assume the balance is set now let's activate a hearing profile for this hold one of the mode buttons for two seconds so the LED above the ear symbol lights up should more than one LED light up press mode again until only the LED in the middle is lit this means the pure hearing profile is activated now the listener can pick his ideal setting on the rotary switch there are a two G settings available every letter features a different sound profile we recommend trying all of them once this is something the user should try out individually there is no right or wrong setting here the one that sounds best to the listener is the right one the sound profiles have been developed by Sennheiser in partnership with the Fraunhofer IDM tea Institute to achieve optimal hearing loss compensation and there is more happening than just a tweaking of frequencies in addition volume limits are being applied to the audio output coming from the TV making sure a sudden jump and loudness like for example in a movie scene does not result in unpleasant bursts of increased volume apart from limiting the maximum loudness level the technology ensures that sounds at low levels will also remain audible at all times this goes for all the sound profiles from A to G in technical terms this is called a dynamic range and it's carefully defined behind every sound profile let's assume a pleasant hearing profile is found there are two additional operation modes that the user can add now there is speech Boost on the left and music mode on the right speech boost is for television use and music mode is for music listening of course let's start with speech boost for watching television this function can be activated to further increase speech intelligibility press mode you can always use the mode button at the headphones as well which ever is more convenient and the left LED lights up the technology at work now can differentiate between human speech and background noise how could the audible result be described for example when there is a voice in a noisy environment like a TV reporter speaking into his microphone while standing on the side of a busy road or in a large crowd where there's lots of noise around him activating this function will significantly reduce that background noise and everything else that is not speech so understanding dialogue or human speech in general becomes much easier and more relaxed to follow if the user finds it difficult or somewhat tiring to follow speech on TV when it's in a noisy environment that is what this mode is specifically designed to take care of with the activation of speech boost we've combined a hearing profile D for example and further added increased speech intelligibility on to that so much for speech boost now let's say you'd want to listen to music with the RS 195 for this this Beach boost would alter the sound of the music quite considerably so press mode once to switch to music mode we've now combined the music mode with the sed hearing profile what's behind the music mode in music mode the headphone allows more overall volume and high frequencies as well as slightly boosting the bass the technology will now allow for a wider dynamic range of sound reproduction within the headphone which is an important factor for music listening also we would highly recommend trying a different setting from time to time to see if your needs or preferences have changed this goes for both of the listening modes lastly you can connect the system to two sources simultaneously however only one can be heard at a time so for connecting the RS 195 to a TV and for music listening we recommend using the optical port for connecting it to the TV as that's the most common interface on TV sets and the analog input as the connection to a receiver PC or mobile device etc to switch between sources use the input selection switch at the back of the transmitter thank you for watching

it's kind of a mouthful to say so that's the only time we want to say it this review until the very end all right cool let's start the review open up the box and the first thing you'll see is the included soft shell carrying case zip it open and inside you'll find the headphones as well as a pouch containing the backup audio cable and the USB cable underneath you'll find the manual and warranty information these come in two color varieties white with tan highlights and black with blue highlights the white variation may be more in line with the classic Bose look but if you ask us the black is the sharper looking of the two the look in general feel should be instantly recognizable if you try to pair Bose headphones in the past few years as we've seen with the companies designs and Bluetooth speakers Oh seems to take a if it ain't broke don't fix it root when it comes to updating its designs as a result these happen to look very much like the qc25 s only - the cable bow says these are engineered with impact resistant materials it's tough to say how tough they actually are without actively trying to break them but that's nice to know while the headphones will flatten out they're not collapsible so if you're throwing them in a backpack make sure to tuck them inside the included case when it comes to actually wearing the headphones they're light and comfortable just like the sound true and qc25 before them they stay comfortable - but they do get a little warm after a while Bose has gone a long way towards making these headphones user friendly and the voice prompt that provides battery life and pairing status on turning the headphones on is a great example of that pairing and repairing the headphones is an easy process even compared to how simple many headphones make it these days these headphones can be paired to two devices at the same time allowing you to switch between them with ease Moses example is watching a video on an iPad while also connected to an iPhone if a call comes in it can switch pausing the video in the process take the call and resume video playback when the call ends there is a major focus on making and taking calls here phone support HD voice and feature adaptive audio adjustment to help keep call quality good even when you're in noisy or windy environments neither of these environments were available while we were testing the call quality was indeed much nicer than some other headphones we've seen looking at the controls it's the standard three buttons the plus and minus buttons only control volume here everything else is taken care of by tapping the multifunction button tapping once will pause and resume playback or answer and end calls tapping twice will skip forward while tapping three times skips backward both claims an impressive 15 hours of playback time and during our testing we found this to be right on the mark charge time is stated as 3 hours though this will depend on the charger you use since none is included just the USB cable oh says that a quick charge time of 15 minutes will provide up to 2 hours of battery life which is handy if you do find yourself running out of battery life just make sure to keep the included audio cable with you unlike a lot of bluetooth headphones these will work in passive mode meaning plugged in of course the volume will be a little lower and the headphones won't sound exactly the same that's why Bose refers to this as a backup audio cable the lows are solid enough but if you live and die for bass these probably aren't going to do it for you instead these go for a happy medium the bass is certainly more present than many consumer focused headphones but it doesn't go over the top that said the bass on some song sounded like it was coming from a subwoofer somewhere in the room behind me the EQ curve here is far from flat but unlike many headphones released in the last few years the mids aren't kicked down into the ditch vocals are never buried by keys or guitars which isn't an easy feat for some headphones the highs never speak up enough to become overly harsh and there definitely is some roll-off present from the active EQ but they don't sound artificially toned down the sound of the pick hitting acoustic guitar strings would preserve nicely without ever becoming overbearing listening to these headphones it's clear that the DAC is playing with the sound much more than on other Bluetooth headphones fortunately Bose has been doing this long enough that the company has learned a thing or two and while I generally prefer a more hands-off approach when it comes to how the source audio is handled I thought listening to these headphones to be pretty enjoyable you're not going to find any active noise cancellation here you'll need to look into the $400 QC s to get that from Bose but the passive isolation is quite effective with music playing even at lower volumes you're going to struggle to hear anything going on around you the same can't be said for others hearing what you're listening to however these do leak a decent amount of sound just like Beats I'm sure there are plenty of people who made their mind up as soon as they saw the Poe's name if that's what you want to do that's fine but you may be missing out someone who normally prefers more accurate sound I still really enjoyed my time with these they're not for everyone but they're very good at what they do we're giving the Bose Soundlink around-ear wireless headphone to a nine out of ten and that's it for this one everybody for all the details check out the full review over at sound guys comm if you want to stay caught up with everything we do make sure to sign up to our newsletter links to both are down in the description you like the video let us know and don't forget to subscribe I'm Chris look thanks for watching

I already did videos of the qs1 and t1 pro so make sure you go see them if you didn't already do so there are links in the video description and on top of the screen on the back of the box it's written that the air phones can play music for up to 4 hours per charge and standby it's 120 hours the case has an extra capacity of 800 milliamp hours let's open the box and see what we got [Music] ok here we have the case it's matte black color with the qcy logo on the top it actually looks quite nice [Music] you also have some accessories in here there's extra earbuds in different sizes standard soft pots made of rubber regarding charging I wished I would start using USB type-c but it's only got a micro USB 2 standard USB so we still have to keep an extra cable for charging in the case the case design is clean and nice on the front we have a LED light that will blink while is charging on the back we have the micro USB connector and under we have some specs and information to lay this magnetic and inside we have the 2 earphones they look exactly the same as the ones that we get with EQ as one package I don't know if you can see it but the lid is actually a bit transparent very very little but enough to see the LED lights on the air phones while they are charging so you don't need to open the lid to see if the charge has completed or not [Music] their phones are very compact ever made of plastics on the bottom there is a little hole where the microphone is the sound quality is beautiful calls and I've had no issues with it here's the charging connector and a little letter indicating which side it is almost the whole front is covered by the button and a small LED light the right one is of course the same and there's a microphone on both of them removing the rubber buds is very easy just pull them straight off and other we can see the speaker grille the rubber bands also isolates the sound very well and active noise reduction isn't really needed in my opinion to put the bird spat on just push it the air phones are as usual held in where magnetic drop them in and close to it as mentioned before the red charging lights on the air phones are visible through the lid but it's a bit difficult to catch with the camera so I'll have a picture on the side to charge the case disconnect the cable to any five volt power supply I usually use a power bank phone charger or my laptop while charging the air phones the lights will be red and when they are fully charged they will turn white for a little while before turning off two pair this pull them out and as you can see here in left their phone will connect to the right one now we need to connect the right one to the phone just turn on Bluetooth and search for ucy us to our heart for right click it and we go air phones will confirm the connection we both sound and by turning off the lead on the phone we can also see the remaining battery capacity which is very nice now let's disconnect it and see how fast it will reconnect it's quite fast now let's jump over to the music controls we can click once to play and pause the song it doesn't matter if you do it on the left or right there phone click twice on the right one to go to the next song click twice on the left one to go to start of a song or again to go to the previous self if you hold the button to assistant or see if you will start a job do you like Star Wars or Star Trek this type of earphones are very comfortable to wear as there are basically no parts touching your ears except the rubber buds themself this push them in and they will sit there without falling out they are also quite small so not very noticeable the sound quality is good enriched and they got a good amount of bass surprisingly good for such small earphones the don't sound muffled and got a good overall spread of the sound even without tuning with the equalizer the battery usually lasts about three hours per charge with loud music but a total capacity including the 800 milliamp case should be up to max 32 hours when it comes to delay I must say it is low but it is noticeable it hasn't bothered me while watching videos but it might be annoying if you play games that require precise timing of the sound ipx4 water resistance is also in place which means it's not waterproof but it can take some small splashing overall this is a very nice product for such a low price before the purchase is there phones just link to be descriptions below hope you liked the video and remember to subscribe comment and like if you have any questions to post them below and I'll get back to you soon have a nice day bye [Music]

at the newer phones now you can buy these on Amazon I'll put the link up in the description the price only needs 400 bucks now I know what some of you are gonna say 400 bucks good god that's a lot of money and you write about that so this is one of those times that if these headphones don't blow my mind it's RT s status return to sender because 400 bucks that's a little bit steep to pay for some novelty headphones but we're gonna go into this with an open mind now basically the idea behind these headphones these are over-the-air combined with in here with some new Star Wars technology gonna individually tuned to each individual's ear so everybody hears different so these headphones are gonna tune to your specific hearing now all that sounds good but how does it translate into real life let's find out shout out to white shoes back in the building hi Suze fall back alright so we got the Nora Nora phones Ford your bucks alright so let's see what you get inside okay so here's your package let me grab a little unboxing knife all right no don't unbox a knife on deck alright had to search for the tiger tooth here we go look out cirques right okay now right out of the gate the presentation 400 bucks now this might be some eco friendly environmental friendly packaging but it feels kind of cheap feels kind of cheap but like I said we're gonna do this with open mind okay all right so this part right here is a little bit cheesy but the actual case itself is nice let me do the smell test on these smells very leather ish okay you got your normal Brandon let's see is this a magnetic strap okay a little magnetic locking mechanism looks like a little carabiner hook right there let me move this box those arcs can jump in jerks play with the box open these up and let's see what you get inside okay now you get a little rubber silicone style case this is gonna be your cable let's see what kind of cable this is now this is proprietary n2 USBA okay and that's it for this I guess that's a little case holder Norma Brandon and this is going to be your headphones now fresh out of the box so I got a file zorks to the side hold on a second job service keep it moving my bad first out of the box these have a nice weight to them nice amount of stretch this one I was telling y'all about in-ear and over-the-air design let's see how adjustable these are okay got a nice amount of just adjusting adjusting on these now these don't fold up but they fit right back in the case all right so let me peel the plastic off let me see did this come with a book cuz I'm gonna set these up correctly all right no book on these it is what it is let me download the app I want to do this correctly I want to pair them up and I also wanted to knees directly to my ear for a real live natural reaction so let me grab a phone and set these up talk amongst yourselves alright so I got these all set up now I'm ready to do a demo now I got to keep a real job the setup process on this is crazy now keep in mind these don't come with a book so the first thing you got to do is download the app once you download the app you're gonna register you information it's gonna tell you to put the headphones on now there's no Auden off switch once you put the headphones on the automatic gonna turn on and it's voice-activated now the voice prompts it sounds like a Star Trek Star Wars computer kind of voice it's crazy now once you download the app and you start setting up the headphones it's gonna start playing beeps in the air you're gonna hear these computerized sounds it's definitely futuristic this is the first time I ever set up a set of headphones and I felt like I was in the doctor's office it's kind of like when you're taking a hearing test you hear all these computerized sounds but it just felt crazy it felt very futuristic I was smiling the whole time now with that being said they do have two touch buttons I to the buttons on each side those are touch capacitive buttons these headphones automatically turn off when you take them off your ear so there's no warning off just put them on they're gonna turn on take them off they're gonna turn off all right so now I got them calibrated I'm ready to test out some music so here we go so I'm gonna put them on now as far as the fit these fit super comfortable it's kind of like the best way I could describe this is put some in headphones in your ears and then put a set of over your headphones right on top of them all right said Bluetooth connect it welcome back all right here we go now let me um let me find some music and we'll give us a go all right so real quick here's what the app looks like you got your battery percentage you could set your different profiles so I gotta set the children that's max everything you got generic or personalized now personalized that's the custom tune for you that's the one that I set up an emergent mode so if you put it on max that's max bass max everything if you put it off that's the Quietus that they get so of course I got it on max everything all right so let's take it over to some chest music we got French Montana unforgettable here we go live reaction now all these work for hundred bucks let's find out now real quick also if I'm talking loud these kind of give you a noise cancellation feel because you got earbuds inside your ears and you got the cups surrounding the ears so you don't hear nothing else here we go all right now if you tap either one of the ear cups I one side is playing pause the other side is emergent on and off so if I say somebody sauce talking to you you could play in pause just my tap inside I just tapped it to turn it off I gotta start this over alright here we go oh that base is insane I am I have to stand up for this job here we go let's go it's not good enough for me since I'm bad with you let's go it's not gonna work for you nobody can t equal me yo these headphones are crazy let's go let's sit over this drink till I [ __ ] up that's too hard to take up i'm two-stepping y'all let's go I had enough combo for 24 I picked you from across the room alright hold it let me sit back there woah now let me see if doctor Hades I don't know if Jackie Hades or not hold on a second now I gotta take a deep breath alright I know I'm so extra I'm so extra alright hold on a second child I gotta keep it 100% Bri what job on a scale of one to ten I don't scale of one to ten these headphones are a major major major go my mind is blown now let me give you a reference on what they sound like anybody that has the skull crusher candy wireless headphones with that fake reproduce extra head pounding bass imagine that kind of base but sounded a little bit more clean now here's the thing in-ear headphones they give you a more of a real sound because the head the headphones are going right into your eardrums so in ear headphones they always sound a little bit richer and a little bit cleaner then over there in my opinion so imagine I'm at this little if you want to see how these sound just take your favorite in-ear headphones put them in your ears and they take another set of headphones and put them on top of them so you got the headphones in your ears and there are big cups engulfing your ears basically like an airtight seal yeah very rarely am I am I at a loss for words the sound on these headphones I'll just answer a simple question Audis worked for hundred bucks and the answer is yes without a doubt now I'm gonna keep a real job I was kind of hoping I'm getting a phone call ignore that I was kind of hoping that these wasn't that good because I'd be having so many requests to try these out at Florida bucks I was like now I really wasn't feeling them like that you know whenever people overhyped stuff I tend to not really buy into the hype but this is one time whoever was hyping these up and whoever asked me to review these thank you hey thank you these headphones are in sane now they all wireless yo I got a pause I'm opposing video real quick i know i'm hype i'm a poison video real quick i'm gonna try out a couple of different songs i got a play this is america that song got mad bass i'm gonna try to a couple of different songs a couple of different genres of music and I come back to y'all in a second talk amongst yourselves all right John so we back in and I had to calm down pick my brain up off the floor put it back in my head let me tell you something on a scale of one to ten these are a major major major major go I am blown away now if you don't trust me or nothing else trust me your knees these are gonna blow your mind right now it's over for my sonís it's over for my sin Isis it's over for my beats I'll still keep the Skullcandy questions for the gym but these are definitely gonna be my new official travel headphones now there's no noise cancellation but you're not gonna need that the way these fit you got the in here and over it forms a tight seal you're not gonna hear nothing else around you and the sound quality is literally incredible now I don't know what kind of Star Wars technology they got going on here but whatever it is it works now the only downside I can see to these so far is it didn't come with a cable so now when you get on the airplane you don't have a cable now I just Google it real quick you could go to the website you could buy the USB type-c you could buy lightning adapter it doesn't come with the cables but it is what it is are these headphones worth $400 and the answer is hell yeah without a doubt even if I were to pay 500 for these I would they'll be completely happy yeah I can't see me behind the camera but I played a bunch of different songs I played this is America I played some disco yeah I know the heartbeats I played the barbeque music this outstanding trust me when I tell you each song that you play it sounds different but if you play a song that has a lot of bass if you like a lot of bass go to the app and put that on front stage trust me when I turn I hate sounding like a hike beast but this is one of those times that I got to be OD hypebeast these are worth every penny anyway these are the narrow phones by normal with the Star Wars Star Trek technology hit me up in the comments let me know what y'all think about these shout out to everybody rocking with me on Facebook Foursquare Twitter

and you know good reputation seller anyway so let's start off with the difference this year the little sliding box here the fake pair you're not gonna notice the difference in unless you have these the real pair in hand but the real pair is a lot more crisp sturdy box white background this here is not this is grayish a total copy you can tell and you can start here with the boxes here also with the white with the serial number the fake pair is a little bit smeared thicker lettering the real pair is crisp everything also when you set these up to for your warranty you're all gonna want to do that when you buy these have you invested that much money of course you want to have your warranty set in so if you go into the both app I mean not the Bozak the DuBose website and you register them for your warranty it's gonna take it regardless if they're real or fake they're just it looks like they're just recycling the numbers so that's not an indicator whether they're real or fake ok so be careful with that let me open these up let's get going with this this is fake pair again real pair so the real pairs in the bottom alright the picture here itself this is a copy again you're not gonna notice difference unless you're comparing it this is more crisp to copy as far as this the booklets aren't almost identical but the real pair's a lot more crisp is a lot more wrinkled than you but not that replacement tips where the real pair comes with the serial numbers sealed completely and label large and small okay the fake pair comes in a ziploc bag the charger the cable for the fake pair is just regular one just not much of a difference I've done real pair has its own tag and zero and serial number also as far as the headphones go the fake pair it's a little bluish fingerprints are there and greasy it's just really easy to get dirty the the real pairs a lot sturdier and thick when you open these up this was a big indicator for me but look at this it just fell apart I'm probably not gonna have that happen all the time okay so mine was a pretty easy giveaway you see how you got to move around for it to charge see it's not really doing it unless you move it with the real Paris is nice and sturdy open them up another comparison really quick as far as the headphones go okay the orange ones are the fake real just that the weight itself just right off the bat you can tell this is more sturdy a little bit heavier these are not these are a lot lighter the plastic here in the back for the fake pair blueish scratched just cheap this is nice and shiny the charging tip here the gold for the fake pair it's a little cheaper and this is lots crisp and shinier the feel as far as a typical the fake pair just feels a little flimsy these feel really sturdy if you're an amateur and don't really know much about the sound and don't have an experience once you put these on than you hear them it's actually really good they're not bad okay but it's not until you try the real ones that you notice a difference the base the clarity everything is just this is really good on the on the real ones these are well once you compare them or not the fit on both it's pretty good actually you know if you're like I said you're an amateur you're probably not gonna notice a difference but yeah they're getting really good with the with the fake snow but also if you want to save yourself some time and just you know go through all this and start comparing getting down to the details download the both connect app and as soon as you download that and open the app and you open these up the both connect app is gonna read them right away and ask you to you know set them up and download the new software the firmware or whatever these will not connect to the app at all whatsoever so even if you go online and they ask you to troubleshoot because you're 100% convinced that are real and they asked you to delete the app and download it again and whatever and it's not gonna work no it's not it's supposed to pick it up right away so yeah that's the biggest indicator there but as far as quality goes just be careful because it's not much of a difference so anyways guys thanks for watching if you guys have any questions or comments go ahead and leave in below the video

WF-1000X|Sony WF-1000X headphones|true wireless|SOny|sony headphone|true wireless headphones|Noise-Cancelling Headphones,2020-10-07 10:22:46.313036, we still haven't come across the perfect pair of true wireless headphones but this next one actually comes very close hey guys it's John Vee here with phone Reena and this is a review of the Sony WF 1000x I'm not really a fan of that name but it is what it is so these are Sony's latest true wireless headphones and what's unique about them is that they have some premium elements that you're not gonna find with other headphones like noise cancellation so let me start off with their design it's a little bit under peculiar side just because they strike a balance between casual and sport but they never seemed to satisfy either now for me it kind of looks tacky because it has this faux metal polished finish which is kind of surprising because Sony is really known for its high premium designs every like how they fit in the ear they have a snug fit that's thanks in part to the swing ear hooks that they offer but it's kind of strange that it doesn't have a water or sweat resistant construction which is something we see in many headphones in its class given that this is Sony we're talking about it's kind of shocking just because I feel they kind of dropped the ball when it comes to the battery charging case it looks clunky and it doesn't really offer that much in terms of functionality yes it's a case I'll protect it and yes it'll charge them as well but the overall package is kind of lacking in comparison to what we've seen out there for example you're only going to get two additional charges out of the case and its functionality is very limited you're not gonna find any charging capabilities with this one to charge other devices nor are you going to find any sort of magnetic connections for the earbuds and what makes the Sony WF 1000x a little bit more unique than some of the other true wireless headphones we've checked out is that you're going to use the Sony headphone connect app for Android or iOS what's really neat about is that it offers predefined equalizer settings to choose from which offers greater audio fidelity in general on top that will provide relevant information like the battery life the volume controls the sound quality mode and adjustments for its adaptive sound controls it's basically a smart sensing technology the headphones will actually listen in to your surroundings and lauda matically true the correct adaptive sound controls for you I take for example walking mode which will boost the ambient noise around you while you're wearing the earbuds and also while listening to music most of the playback controls are done through the app there are these tiny fiscal buttons on each earbud the left one will automatically cycle through the different adaptive sound controls while the right one will just do a pause play function these earbuds leverage Bluetooth 4.1 technology and it does have pretty good range and my testing got roughly around 25 feet a little bit short of its rating of 35 feet but still not bad but better yet is that I didn't have too many occasions where it dropped the connection I'll tell you now though the biggest deal-breaker for me is that it has some latency issues when it comes to watching video there's a delay so obviously what they're watching what they're hearing are never in sync and obviously this is a distraction but when it comes to sound quality I really can't complain because yes you do have those equalizer settings to choose from and even without using one of them the overall quality has a very neutral balance and it doesn't lean too heavily on one particular audio range so the lows mids and highs are well represented I only minor complaint about the sound quality is that it struggles with the lows a little bit you want to select the bass boost option and finally I have to admit this probably has one of the best noise cancellation features around it does a phenomenal job in neutralizing background noise battery life for me is kind of average here I managed to get roughly two and half hours from a single charge but that's gonna largely depend on whether or not you enable noise cancellation right now you could probably pick up the Sony WF 1000x for about $180 and that places it in the premium segment in the market for the price you're getting a ton of features you have noise cancellation have those equalizer settings to choose from a pretty good audio quality in general and you have those ambient sound modes to choose from on the downside though it lacks a water-resistant construction you're going to find those latency issues with video and the battery charging case is kind of clunky seriously though this came very close to being the perfect pair of true wireless headphones but it falls just a little bit short so if you guys want to learn more about the sony WF 1000x you could check out our

10:22:46.313101, [Music] today guys today is a special occasion I'm super excited because we have a classic in the house a legend if you might but with a twist now audio-technica has just revamped their classic headphones 280x m50x headphones now with bluetooth capabilities I'm super juiced to give you guys this review now this is what we've all been waiting for so now that they are here how did the new m50x bluetooth turn out has audio technica made history again with these headphones find out today so let's start off with the comfort and design they keep that same classic design of the black with the silver trimmings it looks just as gorgeous as the day I first set my eyes on them about five years ago the m50x Bluetooth keep that same amazing build quality as the originals you can really beat these things up and not skip a beat get it on the left ear cup you have a volume rocker and play/pause button where you can skip tracks as well there's also a power button and a pairing slider near the front of the cub and this presented a problem for me it's very hard and confusing to navigate the control system on these headphones sometimes especially since the buttons are on the flat side and not clearly mark where you can fill them with your fingers and things like that also on the left ear cup you have a 3.5 millimeter jack the 3.5 millimeter chord has a controller and a mic which is a nice touch and there's also an included USB charger the headband is comfortable and the leather cups still clamp to your head giving you that true close back experience some people might not like that added pressure but this actually keeps you from needing noise cancellation because nothing gets past these ear cups in conclusion amazing build quality and comfort if you like closed back headphones for the design of the new Bluetooth Patrol's I wish they were a little bit better but they aren't bad but I mean let's be honest they're not necessarily great then 50 X's are known to be some of the most balanced headphones for audio engineers and music enthusiasts they feature a 45 millimeter aperture driver which is incredibly detailed for the price of $200 guys I kid you not these are the sounding Bluetooth headphones that I've tried this year in my opinion and they are only $200 that is just an incredible deal these are closed back so you won't get that open back spaciousness but in turn you gain that close back bass and power all instruments and vocals sound that much stronger coming from a great set of closed back headphones from Frank Ocean to Calvin Harris to Pink Floyd these reproduced music so well acoustic songs also sound buttery smooth I feel like I'm riding on a musical sheet of the musicians playing their instruments simply amazing what's better is that you can actually plug these into a DAC app as well and get like an audiophile type system going on at home if you want audio technica really nailed it with these headphones I must say I'm thoroughly impressed but I think that you guys will be too once your ears get a hold of these bad boys the battery life is rated at 40 hours holy crap not only that but you get amazing sound on top of it so you get to enjoy that amazing sound of the m50 exes for 40 freakin hours I wasn't expecting that I always think it may be like 15 to 20 kind of like v-moda you know they kind of stress having really good sound quality and not much on the like bluetooth and battery side so it's a really nice that they've coupled this with an amazing package they're really trying to give you a legendary headphone with these set of cans the call quality is good enough for most applications I wouldn't say it's the best but I would say it's definitely on part with slepping like Sony but not as good as Bose the connection is rock-solid in crowded areas these also feature aptX for you Android users out there and AC for iPhone users and it's rockin bluetooth 5.0 I tell you guys Audio Technica pack these things full with the best technology they really want to make history with these headphones and quite frankly they did these make v-moda sound like a children's toy in my opinion the m50x BTS are a statement headphone and they've left a great impression on me guys so if you guys are thinking about picking these up let me know down below thank you guys for watching I'll have a link in the description so you can buy these because these are amazing for 200 bucks you will be blown away let me tell you no matter what you listen to no matter what you like these will do a great job so thank

Instead, check out the impressive, comfortable and ANC-powered Sennheiser HD 4.50 BTNC Bluetooth headphones.

Tech expert Dave Taylor of https://www.AskDaveTaylor.com/ gave these new Sennheiser ANC headphones a spin and found they work great and have remarkable sound for their price point. There are, however, a few issues you'll want to know about before you rush out and buy 'em...

headphones for under 200 bucks let's check them out [Music] Dave Taylor here anam hang on a second okay Dave Taylor here and I'm checking out these these are the sign Heiser HD 4 series more specifically HD 4.5 0b TNC wireless Bluetooth active noise-cancelling headphones it's a lot of words there and the good news is those words are all worth it because these are really nice headphones now let me start with the most fun part which is they fold up not only do they fold up but they have a little convenient little carrying bag and it makes it really easy for you to tow them around now turns out they actually not only sound really good which is exactly what you'd expect from Sennheiser but the active noise cancellation is good enough that I put music on on my stereo and then put music on the headphones and then turned on the active noise cancellation which they call noise guard and you know what I couldn't hear the stereo I could only hear these now part of this is because it's a closed back design so when you put these on your ears you get a pretty darn good seal so there's not much ambient noise you're getting anyway but once you figure out how to turn on active noise guard which is actually probably one of the biggest problems that these headphones have but we'll get back to the controls in a second but once you figure out how to turn those on then works really well now on the edge of the right cup you have power you have this sort of weird multifunction button that if you push its pause play but you can move it up or down to get to previous or next track you can also use it to answer a phone call or hang up on someone because it does have built-in microphones so it works really well for phone calls as long as you can handle having a phone call while you can't hear any ambient noise I don't particularly like that myself so I don't use these for phone calls but they do sound nice now let's see the third control is volume up and down and then there's a play for actually plugging in a wire included which is nice because sometimes you don't want to use them in Bluetooth mode and you can actually use it wired at which point if you power them on then you automatically get the active noise cancellation in Bluetooth mode it's a little more complicated we'll come back to that and then finally the last of the plugs is micro USB comes with a micro USB cable and that's for charging but here's a crazy thing that you charge these fully and they will give you up to 25 hours of listening that's a really long time it's a really long battery for something that's really negligibly light it's really you're not gonna feel this at all it's very comfortable headphones now let's see it's Bluetooth 4.0 and it also includes NFC and support for aptX which is nice unless you have an iPhone like I do and for reasons I can't explain Apple includes aptX on its MacBooks but it doesn't include them on the iPhone so it says use AAC sign Heiser doesn't have AC on this so you just get regular bluetooth which still sounds really really good now 18 ohms 18 to 22,000 Hertz frequency response less than 0.5 total harmonic distortion just in case you like those numbers and they're comfortable and flexible and obviously you can pull them out and they even have some wear on them there I guess it doesn't really yeah it does list left and right always good but all the controls are on the right cup so you know that you do this and now you have all the controls on your finger so let's talk about the controls for a minute as it turns out that it does take a little bit of practice a little bit of messing around to try to get the hang of how the controls work and the noise guard is a little confusing because sine Heiser says that have three different profiles for noise guard but there's no indication that there's any way to choose between the profiles for different noise environments not a big deal the challenge is actually figuring out how to turn it on and turns out that you turn on your headphones you pair them with a device like my iPhone then you hold the volume up and down simultaneously for three seconds and that turns on the active noise cancellation if you use it in a wired mode it's just automatic you turn this thing on boom you got noise cancellation I really wish they would have done something a little simpler or just automatically have it turn on every time you turn on the headphones that would be nice too this might be something they could do I don't know maybe with a firmware update probably not gonna happen but for this generation there is a tiny learning curve you are gonna have to figure out a little bit the you know track up/down button getting noise canceling turned on but once you get over that little hump of learning then I gotta say it's a really nice headphones they have a really nice rich full sound there's no penalty that I can hear when you turn on noise canceling some people say that noise cancelling actually reduces the audio fidelity of the music you're listening to totally don't find that and frankly because of their clothes design and they're soft cups that mold around your ear even if you don't put on the active noise cancellation that these do a really nice job of cutting out the majority of the outside ambient noise unfortunately I haven't tried these on an airplane I would like to but I don't think that they're gonna help pay for my plane ticket so until I have that opportunity I will just say I have used them in noisy environments and they've worked really well nice soundstage warm response and well the music sounds really good it's not tinny or bright on the high end there's good bass without it being muddy everything you'd expect from sign Heiser I mean these guys absolutely know how to make really good headphones and they have really good audio so it's really the noise cancelling and the fact that these are so easily portable that make these more perhaps notable of course the other thing that makes them really notable is the price now you're looking at these and you're thinking these look pretty comparable to those fancy sony and bose act active noise-cancelling headphones that you see people wearing in first class on that airplane but these are not at that level of price which fantastic but before we get there go do me a favor click that subscribe button subscribe to my channel super appreciate it and what the heck thumbs up if you like what I'm doing now the price these sign Heiser HD 4.5 OBT NC wireless bluetooth headphones with active noise cancellation will put will cost you a hundred and seventy $9.99 at amazon.com and I actually can hear my music it is pretty darn loud probably shouldn't do that while we're on the video but you know higher-end units might have tap and drag features on the earpieces and such but these are actually just a nice compromise of being affordable and having a lot of really good features and nice sound and a good active noise canceling system and the fact that they're so portable huge win so this is Dave Taylor I am gonna get back to my music so I'll catch you in my next video [Music]"

This is my review of the fantastic new Anker Soundcore Liberty Neo wireless earphones. The Liberty Neos are the latest and greatest from Anker, and they sound great. They're lightweight, comfortable, have 3.5hrs of listening time and up to 12 hrs of listening time if you factor in that the carrying case can provide three full charges to keep you listening to your tunes longer. These earphones are super comfortable and can be worn for the long haul, especially when you factor in the additional sets of stabilizers and ear tips, which are interchangeable for your individual comfort level. I like these better than the Liberty Airs, and there don't seem to be any connectivity issues either.

review|wireless earbuds 2019|wireless earbuds review|anker soundcore liberty air pairing|anker soundcore|anker soundcore liberty|anker liberty neo|anker soundcore liberty air,2020-10-07 10:22:46.313152, everybody welcome back to tech Odyssey so today I'm here with a review of anchors a sound core Liberty neo wireless earphones now I've recently reviewed the Liberty airs and they were very good but I actually like these a little bit better so as you can see on the front there ultra-compact they've got a nice clamshell style charging case it's very light convenient easy to carry around and really I'm a big fan of these especially for the low price of $59.99 kind of hard to beat that but they are completely wireless there's no wires anywhere it's not like the ones where they have the wire that connects the two together you don't have to worry about anything and stuff all you have to do is just pop them in your ears and go and they're very easy to pair they're very easy to charge they recharge and an hour and a half so completely charged in an hour and a half and you get three and a half hours of playtime of course that does vary based off of your individual usage but it'll go up to three and a half hours on this box as you can see there is kind of a pain in the rear end but on the backs here you can see some of the other specs I've got the graphene driver technology for quality sound ultra compact 12 hours of playtime if you factor in the ability to recharge it with a carrying case sweat resistant IP x5 so it's pretty much got everything under the Sun you could ask for especially in a pair of earphones that only cost $59.99 now you can see there's three little dots there and what those do is they light up they'll indicate how much of a charge the carrying case has but they're great easy to pair easy to use and super convenient so they're very easy to pair like I said all you have to do is just take them out of the carrying case and they instantly enter into pairing mode and I'm going to demonstrate that in a minute but you can pair them together or if you just wanted to take one out you can pair it individually but of course it works best to pair both of them at the same time when you pull them out instantly it enters pair mode you just pull up whatever device you're using and you can go ahead and connect them that way also one thing I do really like is whenever I pull them out they're paired you can use one at a time but let me go ahead and demonstrate here so let me get my iPad and I'll bring that over here to the picture put it into a search mode for Bluetooth and then we'll take the sound cor liberty Neos out and we'll wait for it to pop up on the screen here and there you go Liberty Neos all you have to do is one-stop-shop press the button and you're paired and ready to go which is really fantastic because you don't have to worry about a code you have to worry about pushing a button you don't have to do any of that crazy business but like I said once they're paired you take one out and this is how I use mine most of the time I mean it's really nice whenever you can listen to both at the same time but in my office environment I'm allowed to use them to listen to music while at work so I'll just pop one of them in my ear and then I can listen that way another nice feature is both of them have microphones built into them so if you're using one earphone or you're using both of them at the same time you can get that stereo audio experience which is pretty good I really feel kind of weird talking on the phone when I'm using my earphones but overall it's a nice capability that I'm glad that they include nowadays so your little ear stabilizers you see there's three sets of these there's a set that's already kind of on the earphone but it doesn't have that little wingtip that protrudes for the extra stabilization so you can pop that right off they are marked so you can figure out which one to use but you have three additional sets that have the stabilizers on them and they allow you to wear the earpiece more comfortably I guess I just used it without but if you for your organ ominous need it and it works out great you have the world's smallest USB cable I don't know why they always give such small USB cables but it's kind of annoying because if you want to plug in your charger into the wall you this thing is barely gonna be hanging off the carpet brilliant touch the ground really but I use I use a different cable that comes with mine so the carrying case works really well I do like the availability to just pop the earphones back in there so whenever you're I'm not using them I always put them back in there they'll be charging so any time they're in the cradle they're charging which works out well because when you take them out to use them if you want to recharge the battery the carrying case so I have to just plug that in they don't have to have the earphones in it to be charging now you also got four sets of your tips size for your individual comfort I believe it's extra small small medium and large I used the default ones actually I did change down to one size smaller just so they they would fit a little bit better but they are available so you can put whichever size you need on for your listening needs now like I said it does have one and a half hour charge time three and a half hours of listening time up to twelve hours of play time if you want to pop them back in and out of the carrying cases you need to use them six millimeter dual drivers and the IPX v sweat and water resistance so you got pretty much everything that you could mean and all like I said for 60 bucks it's really a good deal now there is an added functionality with the earphones you can use them like I said you can talk on the phone with them and you can also use the multifunction button so each one of the wireless earbuds on the back there the sound cord logo has a button and all you have to do is just push that button and you can answer phone calls you can hang phone calls up you can press it while you're playing music or watching media and with certain media players it will pause it or it will stop it and if you want to go for the track or backward to track you can just press the button and hold it so that works pretty nice too now the overall sound quality you see little metal filters that they have there that protect the graphene drivers which produce the sound two little pins there which go in the charging case to recharge it the sound quality is actually really good and I was impressed with it not just because they're portable and not just because of the price but I've listened to quite a few other of these portable stow and go completely wireless or truly wireless earbuds as they call them and these are probably the most impressive that I've listened to outside of the Samsung gear buds but you're going to pay $129 for those talking about $59 I recently did get a pair of the Samsung gear buds for my wife because she likes him to go through Samsung phone I tested them out previously and I liked them a lot but for me it's not worth $130 investment these are about probably 85% of the sound experience but you don't have to worry about that added price tag and I really think that all around if I were to recommend a pair of earphones at least is this far into the year I would say to go ahead and pick a pair of these sound corny O's up the base carries really well it has a nice thump to it one thing I do like is that it's not overpowering you know some manufacturers like to go ahead and make their earphones extra booming or add extra bass because they think that that's what people want to hear but in reality all it does is it just drowns out the vocals and it drowns up highs the Liberty Neos have a very balanced sound experience that complements a lot of different types of music and I listen to predominantly 80s and 90s music but I listen to a lot of different genres within that subset so you listen to rock pop alternative and so much different stuff even classical music the sound quality is very good the volume is good I can put this on like 70% volume and my wife says it hurts her ears me and I'm after spending so many years in the military and deployments firearms everything else my hearing is pretty well shot so I turn this up to max and it's read it about acceptable for me I would like it to be just a tiny bit louder because I do like to listen to my music really loud but other than that for a normal person I'm sure the volume is fantastic like I said my wife can't even turn it up all the way with without complaining that it hurts her ears and having to take them out so the sound quality is good the volume is good the functionality is good easy to pair back to the sound experience the the mids and the vocals are really good and that's one thing it's important to me because a lot of times a lot of different earphones they have a hard time producing a quality balanced sound across the sound spectrum and I like to be able to hear the vocals I want to hear this the song is going on not just the beat the bump not just you know the digital stuff or all the other along with it and even on the highs you know the high hats and the different stuff that pops up and comes in and out the sound experience is is balanced and throughout the sound spectrum and especially if you go ahead and you tune it if you use an equalizer and you want to go and balance up the sound experience you can put it to however you would like to listen to it but the chord listening experience is good and it just gets even better if you go ahead and use an equalizer as well which is typically common with a lot of apps not so much to YouTube but maybe YouTube music or use Napster or anything like that there's a lot of different ways you can tune it to your individual listening needs but that's pretty much all I have for the anchor sound chord liberty Neos like I said I'm a big fan of them you can pick them up the drug the and the drop down I've got a link so you can directly go and check them out they're $59.99 and I think that they're probably the best ones that anchor has made to date so if you want a good good quality sound experience you don't want to break the bank you want all the added functionality the stereo stereo phone calls and all that stuff this is something out how they recommend so thanks a lot guys for tuning in I appreciate it if you have any questions or comments leaving the drop down and I will see you guys next time
237,9kb8F1vlGLo,Abt Electronics,UClFPdTOI8x3pR8qwcpAa_vA,Unboxing: Bose QuietComfort 35 Silver Wireless Headphones -  QC35,"Bose QuietComfort 35 Silver Wireless Headphones - 759944-0020
http://www.abt.com/product/101454/Bose-QuietComfort-35-Silver-Wireless-Headphones-7599440020.html?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=QC35_20160607

We spent 40+ years of research in pursuit of the best noise cancellation in the world. Then we obsessed about making it wireless. The result: QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones. Free yourself from wires and connect easily to your devices with Bluetooth and NFC pairing. Volume-optimized EQ gives you balanced audio at any level while a noise-rejecting dual-microphone system provides clear calls even in windy and noisy environments.
These are our best headphones. In making them wireless we had one goal: seamlessly merge Bluetooth and our Acoustic Noise Cancelling technology together with no compromise to the technologies or the audio performance were known for. Try them for yourself—then try to live without them.
Key Features:
• Industry-leading noise cancellation makes quiet sound quieter and music sound better
• Wireless connectivity to your devices through Bluetooth and NFC pairing
• Up to 20 hours of wireless listening per charge and 40 hours when wired
• Premium materials make them lightweight and comfortable for all-day listening
• Bose Connect app helps manage paired devices and gives you a personalized experience
Features:
• Music sounds better 
You turn them on and noise instantly fades away. Your favorite songs soar to new heights sounding so rich and clear you might feel like youre hearing them for the very first time. Its magical to the ear—but its not magic. Its the precise arrangement of microphones inside and outside the earcups. Its proprietary electronics that continuously measure compare and react to outside noises. And its the electronics sending an equal and opposite signal to the earcups speakers to cancel those noises. All so you can enjoy the music you love—or the silence you need.
• Exceptionally strong battery life 
Its thought that battery life suffers with wireless headphones. We changed that way of thinking. How? By customizing the size and shape of our lithium ion battery to optimize the space available in the earcup—all without compromising fit or comfort. You now enjoy up to 20 hours while using the headphones wirelessly a significant duration for wireless headphones. You also get up to 40 hours for wired use.
• Quiet sounds quieter 
The electronic noise floor is another obsession for us. A headphones noise floor is that soft hiss you might hear when listening in quiet environments. Because that noise is measurable we continuously tweaked the electronics in QC35 headphones until that soft hiss became virtually undetectable.
• Premium materials for all-day comfort 
Materials matter. Thats why the QC35 headband isnt just soft its luxurious. Wrapped in Alcantara—the soft covering material used by prestigious international companies in various applications like yachts and high-end automobiles—it provides a welcome comfort designed for all-day listening. The ear cushions are manufactured from a synthetic protein leather and contain a silicone bead for passive noise reduction.
• Lightweight and durable? How? 
The perception is lightweight headphones are made of plastic and easily broken. So we dont use plastic. We use glass filled nylon that provides for a lightweight feel but a high level of durability. These headphones also have strong finishing touches. Stainless steel is used for the headband spring and pivots to ensure the headphones are durable enough for everyday use.
• Easy control 
Connecting to Bluetooth devices and switching between them—say from your iPad to iPhone when a call comes in—is now delightfully easy. The free Bose Connect app manages all connections with an intuitive graphic interface. Once paired with multiple devices the headphones will switch between them automatically whenever you want. The app also provides software updates product tips and even lets you personalize your settings.",20,93490,70.0,376.0,45.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9kb8F1vlGLo/hqdefault.jpg,bose|unboxing|qc35|qc 35|wireless|bluetooth|noise|cancelling|canceling|headphones|2016|new|updated|qc 25|qc25|unbox|box|un boxing|best|over|the|ear|ios|android,2020-10-07 10:22:46.313174, hey everybody I'm Carl with apt and we've got these brand-new bose qc25 headphones here so we're going to do an unboxing for you so you can take a look and see what's inside of the packaging so we're gonna get started cut through the plastic on the top here and open them up for you so we have a slide-out box here so you just slide that through and then right here on the top we've got a Bose logo and so we'll open that up some kind of foam padding here we'll put that out to the side and then we've got the headphones it looks like everything's inside of here so we'll open that up in just a moment we've got some instructions here QuietComfort 35 some more information on the headphones a warranty card and I'm not sure that's not in English so we'll put that off to the side here and then we've got some some instructions here it shows you how to use the Bluetooth NFC shows Bose Connect here it's an application that you can download off of Android or Google Play or the Apple App Store and so we'll move all this out of the way and take a look and see what's inside of the actual case here so it comes in a really nice carrying case it's got the Bose logo here on the front kind of a leather feeling material a nice zipper that goes all the way around and here are the headphones so we'll pop those out and they come packaged in all of this packing material here so we'll move that off to the side and here are the headphones these are really nice and lightweight here they've got a really good feel to them so take a look there all around you can see the microphone there a little power switch a little Bluetooth logo there and then we've also got see here try and open this up well scissors didn't do me any good they're having a little trouble with this one sorry yeah we'll come back to that they use some pretty good tape on these cut through there you've got a USB cable so it'll micro USB on this end full-size USB on the other end and back to the tough part there we go and we've got our headphone cord so this is the wired cord that you can use so it comes with that comes with the USB cord and the headphones themselves and this really nice carrying case and here we've got another adapter piece this is for the airplane adapter there's a little airplane logo on there so another little Bose logo on the top and that is everything so those are the QC 35 s from Bose make sure you stay tuned to our YouTube channel we're going to do a product overview video on these let you know what they sound like and give you all the details so thanks for watching and stay tuned make sure you leave your comments below and be sure to LIKE and subscribe on YouTube

guys Josh tech gamer back again with a tech video now this is a short video I want to do an update on the review on my JBL's now headphones now I was gonna say gaming headphones now I wanted to do a short update because I did these a while back these these headphones if you guys want to check out the video I did actually did three videos but one of them hit sixty thousand views and I'm still getting constantly views and comments and everything on these headphones so I want to get into these real quick and talk about these real quick so I've been using these for quite a while now good couple more than couple months like five six seven months I've been using these for a while and they work great now they do come in five different colors they come in black red green white and blue so if you guys want to pick up different colors go for it I did want to get the whites but they didn't have them at t-mobile and that's where I purchased them at t-mobile for $99 now a lot of people ask me how do they sound now JBL's makes some great speakers and they do make some great headphones now do I recommend these when you're gaming on the computer no they don't sound they're not meant for gaming I use these mostly for music or stuff and that's why I said if you're getting a gaming headset get a special gaming headset these are just meant for music and everything I use these all the time now they do have 16 hour battery life to our quick charge so that is great now you guys are probably saying 16 hour battery life now listen I've been using these gym I take these all the time and I've been using them I go to the gym like least five days a week with them and I constantly use them for over an hour and I haven't even charged them in two weeks so the battery lasts is a lot longer than they expect now these things do are wireless bluetooth now they connect super fast and they're super responsive now the thing is they do have a wire that comes with the attachment if you want to use the wire you can but why would you have wireless headphones if you're gonna use a wire but just in case they die or whatever so you have that option now the comfort on these headphones I cannot explain how comfortable these are now there are a little bit smaller as you guys can tell they are kind of small and you know they did you look smaller now when they fit they fit perfect they don't move around now I did have a problem with the first ones that I bought they were a little defective every time I kept moving them they would just loose one side would be kind of loose and everything so I had that issue with these but I did return him and t-mobile gave me a new pair and I haven't had that issue since now like I said before the audio sounds great on these headphones I can't really show you but I can tell you JBL makes great speakers like I said so great heads headphones yes now they're very comfortable like I said they don't hurt after wearing a periods of time and stuff now they do have this nice cool little JBL logo right here in this nice little fabric soft material so I recommend now someone asked me questioning me before on these when you're sweating and stuff these are sweat proof so you know if you are constantly sweating you're afraid to get these ruined don't worry about it they're good so other than that these are pretty much good quality headphones now I use these for when I go on the car or I go traveling or somewhere and I take them with me and I just listen to music so these are the only ones that I actually have I do have another set it's not JBL it's my REO box a company that did send me some wireless headphones and they were great but these are my main drivers I use all the time now people ask me Josh should I go to the beats now my friend has the beats and he said the thing is they are super busy now these do pack a good punch but they're not super bassy like the beats they these sound great I'm just telling you I had a lot of people actually buy these because of my review I'm sure the Sony's or the or the Bo are really good but for $99 you can't beat that now like I said if you don't like two small cups you can always get the bigger cups so they fit more around the ear and stuff but yes so these are the e45 BTS so if you guys want to check these out I'll put it in the description below I actually want to do a short little update review on these now real quick if you want to access your phone you don't have to when it's on the Bluetooth if you actually right here you can pause play and fast-forward all on your headphones so you don't have to go to your phone and drain your battery so it's pretty cool you just right there and you can just click it boom you're ready to go to put around the neck and just pretty much bam you as you guys see here my pictures of my little thumbnail picture I have pictured me wearing these because I just love them I like how I just fits around my neck and it stays right there now they do have the left and right on here and they got to charge right there now the charge cable is really cool it does come with the orange with the box so it's like an orange color because that's what JBL's color is so these are pretty simple you just connect them and they're ready to go but that's about it guys I want to do a little short review on these and stuff pretty much I think I went over everything the quick they're charged about two hours charge and 16 hour battery life so this has a 3.5 millimeter jack so I mean these are great and you get a one-year warranty come in white blue green now the green moves to me is kind of like a kind of like a teal so in red so they're kind of like the bees they have all different colors so guys thanks for watching Josh check him I'll put this in my tech review playlist down below where I'll do an update review on these headphones so other than that these are just great headphones to purchase now I'd have I'm still getting comments and hits on this JBL update 60,000 views on this tech video I did now I did do an update on the defective one so I'll put that all down below in description the playlist and those three videos if you guys want to check them out in the description of this also don't forget the if you guys want to subscribe to my patreon and it's only $1 a month I'll put that link down below it's to support me and my

high-end over the ears headphone featuring active noise cancellation guests your support and more importantly high res audio the package comes included with the soft carrying case micro USB cable for charging and also the mil-to-mil 3.5 millimeter headphone jacks and you can use the headphone jacks without powering on the headphones if you're going old school and a lock it uses bluetooth 4.1 for connectivity with support for aptX HD on Qualcomm device slightly higher than your standard apt X now you also have NFC control right here meaning you can tap and sing to multiple devices quite quickly from out as the maximum stable line-of-sight astrov meters now this baby's right here feature guest your support which is located on the right side with one finger you can just swipe up and down for your volume for selection of your music track is forward or backwards and double tap is for your call function or media controls for agronomy adjustment the headphone features two waist swivel mechanism right here at the hip and expand up to 4 cm usually on other headphones it's only 3 cm so this expense 1 cm longer and it's reinforced by metal bands right here now aside from that there is a thick padding at the hip belt right here that closed well around your hip now talking about the ear cuffs right here the ear cuffs is measuring overall is 9.6 cm by 7.3 cm which the opening is 6.5 CM by 4 cm with a depth of 2 cm and the overall padding thickness being 1.5 cm so it's really cushioning ish I would say the ear cups is somewhat soft but irritants is structure overall if you see from this video right now and when it comes to the peso sound isolation meaning the hardware although not the active noise cancellation pad it's quite good to knock down most of the low frequency noises and mongrels barking in the background now aside from that if I shake my head aggressively of course the headphones will stay in place now when it comes to the active noise cancellation you do need to power on the headphones first before awning and off the active noise cancellation so I wish in the future Sony make it an independent system like other headphones where you don't need to power on the head you can just on the active noise cancellation through a manual switch I think that direction would be wise for Sony in the future update but right now it's just a nice implementation even though they don't make that switch now aside from that I would say the active noise cancellation helps to knock down a lot more of that lourd ambient noises and low frequency noises especially I tested this in Malaysia on the noisiest train which is the LRT train system in NOx now all the training weird noise the wheels the track sound it just works really fine this is one of the best headphones for active noise constraint and it's better than Bose headphones and I would say it's close compared to the a high-end Sony WH 1000 Mach 2 almost close to death and it feels good I can sleep in a train and I miss three stops and I wish that when I were in the Train that's how good the headphones is so quiet that it just kills the ambient noise you can talk about the ambient mode function as well no more what means you can hear your surroundings a little bit great for awareness so you don't get knocked down by a bus or kind in the city and another is wind reduction as the name implies now it has other functions and features which one of them is the high res audio that supports audio quality better than your standard CD quality lydic support which transmits more data than your conventional Bluetooth and aptX for better audio quality for supported devices and DC hitch X sound engine that restores high range sound lost during compression this is requiring the Sony hit phone app for you to use it so get that it is brought to life by a pair of 40 millimeter neodymium driver and the rated battery life is 28 hours hour battery life test uses the iPhone 6 @ v volume bar with noise cancellation on we managed to get 29 hours and 35 minutes with noise cancellation off we managed to get 36 hours and 30 minutes not that bad now for other quality tests for pop in India I chose tnb okay the low base frequency is so public energetic and not above you can feel the air movement in your ears the low base frequency is well body it does not eat into the vocals and he has zero base Distortion the subtle base vibration fit smoothly as well the low bass overpowers the vocals but not to a huge amount to a point in mothballs or push back the vocals behind for PR me I'll do it again the bass is so bubbly energetic and firm you can feel the air pressure once more the bass face butter smooth with the long drag especially at a two minute and a five-second mark the vibrations is just your chasm the bass does not overpower the vocals much and it feels balanced compared to the earlier song there's a clear separation between the two the base is well bodied once more and the idiom tones generally sounds fun for vocals and instrumentals we choose violin during drop the piano and violin tone sounds right and natural lean closer to the crystal-clear type and not the warm sounding type I prefer the crystal-clear type he has the right amount at the highest just right on the tones are well body and it does not sound have had that the bass and drum feels balanced with the piano and violin tone in terms of audible level though there is a clear separation between the two good indication of a balance headphones for patter tonic see true mistress is high-pitched Milton on vocals performs well at the highest with the right amount of shine of course it feels bright especially at the 45 second mark each singer can be identified easily every diction and pronunciation is crystal clear vocal big boxing echoing and humming is orgasm which does not overpower mich glasses vocals in the song this headphones performs well when it comes to the low bass frequency to the high frequency ma notably is the piano in a Bonnie tone sounds bright and does not have that warm sounding pie on the little mottling nurse so this headphone suits my taste and needs and you'll find this headphones to be very relaxing especially the active noise cancellation knocking off the low ambient noises even the air conditioner on my back right here can you see in the video right Yeah right there it just locks it out and you can just feel relaxed and sleep with this headphones is dis comfortable with this ear cuffs right here and you will not go wrong with this headphones if you're choosing them so you can also purchase them links in the video description for where you can get them and also the pricing comment no wonder Sony products we should review next remember to comment where you're from remember I like to subscribe down with hello channel and see you guys in the next Sony review yay I'm hoping Sony gives me the W hich 1000 mach 2 for review

#RazerNari",28,91028,372.0,1309.0,22.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KfC5JeN86AQ/hqdefault.jpg,razer|nari|wireless|rgb|lighting|headset|headphones|gaming|steam|pc|ps4|playstation|xbox|one|nintendo|switch|thx|surround|sound|bass|beats|audio|best|review|turtle|beach|apple|android,2020-10-07 10:22:46.313260, [Music] all right guys so today we're gonna take a look at the razor nari Wireless now the first thing I want to point out is that is powered by Razer chroma so if you have the other Razer chroma devices like the keyboard the mouse the mouse pad even the speaker's now you can sync it up the RGB lighting so that these will coincide with all your other stuff these also have thx spatial audio if you're not familiar with that that's what a lot of movie theaters use for surround sound [Applause] [Music] so it should be very good with spatial awareness all right so this is you know typical razor packaging all their packaging kind of looks the same it says for gamers by gamers as you can see this is still a micro USB connection to USB this would be for charging battery life on these you will get 14 hours if you're going to use the chroma lighting on the side and then you can get 24 hours if you turn that off alright so it does come with a headphone cable so you are able to use this wired into you know your phone your Nintendo switch anything that uses a regular three-and-a-half millimeter cable both the cables are a braided fabric cable alright so that looks to be it I'm concerned while there you know what never month I was gonna say that I'm concerned I didn't find the wireless dongle but this is like the Man O'War headset where they hide it into the headset itself as you can see it's a 2.4 gigahertz wireless dongle so you're able to use this into your PC and I will also check to see if it works wirelessly into the PlayStation 4 as well build was it seems as though razors kind of taken the suspension headband along with the hard metal or alloy frame they've used this on a couple of other headsets underneath its razor embossed on a kind of a leather --is-- material it's very soft but again with headphones and ear cups that have this kind of weight you definitely are gonna want some kind of suspension otherwise that would be a lot of weight on the top of your head it does have the cables inside which I am not a fan of simply because it's exposed cable this can be cut and then nothing's going to work these do not pull up and down they are simply just using the suspension to get the right height on these they do swivel and lay flat but they do not fold inward now ear pad material this is like a micro suede type material right here this is important because this keeps it cool it's not the fabric or the leather which you can see on the side or the fake leather or whatever this is it's not that on top which usually causes your ears to so this will keep you cool the opening of the earpads are large and and deep so your ears will actually sit inside of here pretty comfy definitely enough give it's not as soft a memory foam as some of the other headsets out there but this is extremely soft by the time this is on your head you're not gonna feel clamping force and they're just really comfortable once again you can see that razor kind of went with the mesh look that goes around on the ear cup and then right here where the Razer logo is this is where your chroma lighting your RGB lighting can change and you do that within the software again you can have it just a one color you can have it Bri the color there's several different things that you're able to do now the microphone on this is actually built-in it's on the left-hand side of the ear cup and it just simply extends and has really good Bend so you're able to get it exactly pinpointed where you want but since we're talking about the mic let's go ahead and check out a mic test right here alright guys ooh this is a might test of the Razer naari Wireless so most wireless mics I haven't found any that has just been absolutely incredible I think that this does a really decent job of picking up tones I think it comes through clearly so as far as playing online you will have no issue with it people being able to hear you you also have a mic mute button on the back part of the headband as soon so as soon as you touch it tip of the microphone turns red to let you know that it's muted so that is the mic test of the razer nari wireless all of your controls are actually sitting to the back of the ear cups but let's go ahead and look at those on your right hand side this is the volume wheel it has pretty good tension and it does stop as to wear some headphones just let you keep rolling and you never know where the max is until it hits like a certain tone on the left-hand side you have your mic mute button up top and then you have the control to mix in the game sound with the chat sound underneath that use your power button above that you can see the notification light then you have your micro USB port for charging and then you have your three-and-a-half millimeter headphone jack input so overall as far as the looks and the build quality they basically look like they just kind of pulled from different razer headsets to build this but now we're going to talk about the sound because there's a hundred and fifty dollars worth the price tag on the razer nari wireless well first off the best way to describe these things is basically the sound fits the look it's very big it's very bold and what I mean by that is base impact is thick it has a lot of low-end to it sometimes it kind of rolls over into the mid so I felt like mids we're kind of pulled back some so that means vocals especially this is more geared on the music side of things I felt vocals was kind of pulled back treble the highs everything came through extremely clear music with these is where I felt like within the app you really needed to go in and try to do a lot of adjusting now it had its presets built in but I felt like going into the EQ and playing around I was able to get more of a sound that I liked now with gaming these things are incredible they're huge like I said so the bass impact with explosions at running into stuff gunshots things like that you're really able to feel it's quite the sensation to have the feeling of bass just hitting every time something like that happens now because of the THX the spatial awareness in this is perfect for first-person shooters you have a really good awareness where everything is around you now I've used these wirelessly with the ps4 the Nintendo switch and my PC I don't have an Xbox one to test but there's no reason to think that these won't work overall sound is just exciting it's fun the awareness that you're able to pick apart with the surround sound although it's not natural surround sound it is trying to push this with just two speakers on your left and right but I was still able to tell Werth what direction things were coming in and had a really good idea of the distance of where people were so for a wireless headset that you're able to use the USB dongle which causes zero lag and able to also use and wire it as well this is a very very nice overall headset I do feel like weight is a little heavy on these I feel like the base is a little booming this is minor nitpicking stuff I don't see any any problem with the build quality I think these will have no problem lasting a very long time so overall this is a very feature-rich wireless headset that can cover all Graham's movies they sound fantastic the thx really comes into play there again with gaming it sounds amazing music you definitely just want to listen to in stereo mode the THX surround sound just is playing with in a way that it shouldn't but that is my review of the brand new Razer naari Wireless so thank you guys so much for checking out this video thank you guys so much for checking out all the other videos and as always guys make sure to stay tuned for more

wireless headphones|best budget bluetooth headphones|mi super bass bluetooth headphones|mi super bass wireless headphones features|super bass headphones xiaomi|xiaomi super bass headphones,2020-10-07 10:22:46.313282, [Music] hey guys this is Jayden form is more times and you're watching a quick unboxing our future overview of the sharm is me super bass survivalist headphones these are available at amazon as a part of the primary deal so I instantly bought it because it's something new in India this was not earlier available now it's launched in the country and these are priced at 1800 rupees there are two options for the colours that's black and gold and black and red so this is the black and red that we bought and these are the major features a 4000 image battery that would give you about 20 hours of playback time since it's a Bluetooth one a wireless one you would rely on its battery for the audio playing and that is said to be about 20 hours a 40-millimeter dynamic driver for the audio output and it's said to offer quite a heavy bass but that will be touching them out for the next couple of weeks at least and I am anyway traveling so you'll also know whether these are good for travel and it has a light and comfortable fit and it comes with bluetooth 5.0 for the connectivity and I've already taken out the headphones use them a couple of times and I actually like them so far but that won't be the final judgement and there's a charging port of micro USB 1 5v 1a of charging impedance of 32 and net weight of 150 grams so that headphone weighs 150 grams which is actually quite less the emmab is $21.99 but it's available for 1800 rupees and that's it this is the box package there's nothing much in the box anyway you'd see the headphones and then you will see the cables and nothing else would we have seen in there so this is the headphones these are the me super bass headphones with the black and red option and apart from that in the box what you find out these cables and there's a quick manual as well so this is the charging cable which is the micro USB cable that you find along with it and there's this 3.5 3.5 cable that's the oxford cable so that in case you want to use it with your phone and not with the bluetooth option you can do that as well thanks to this one so it has the adoption as well in case the battery is dying out and you want to rely on phone's battery to play their music on your headphones so that's one addition which is good so you don't have to always rely on it being Wireless this is the user manual that you get along and that would quickly give you an instruction of what all you can do here so there are buttons that can be used for incoming calls and pressing for answer and present whole to decline and there's also this chain by mode press two times and there's also that that would activate the voice assistant when you press it two times this is the music button where you have the volume options and also the play a play and pause button iOS device support battery and volume display but otherwise may not so this might be a disadvantage for the Android ones they might not be able to show you how much battery is left and do not use power bank to charge the me super bass to wireless headphones so that's the warning again you cannot use power bank though I have already tried it with the power bank and it was charging so they want there was not an issue but in case is an issue the company already tells you that you shouldn't be doing it so in case there's an issue that would be a problem for you guys so that's with the box packets coming back to the headphones these are the ones that's the me super bass wireless headphones and they actually feel pretty lightweight and it's all plastic to be trying so that is why they are light in weight and they might also seem a bit on the lesser side of the premium that you can call it it's they don't feel premium or classy but the good thing that I see here is the ear muffs can be actually more so this thing would make it comfortable and most of the headphones do not have this feature so when these are moving when you place them on your ears this sit there comfortably based on how your head position and the ear position would be and that makes it much more comfortable than the regular headphones and this is on both the sides and I am holding it for a couple of times and I felt they are pretty comfortable and the good thing is that I don't like heavy headphones even though they might be feature filled or they might have a heavier battery but 20 hours of battery life is what the company claims which is already quite good enough and the other thing is that being light they don't ever exert any pressure on your head and ears so that's a good thing here and this is this connecting arm is also quite flexible so that makes it even more easier to wear it for long arts and this is the extendable arm so that is the that's also made of plastic I suppose and that's it and these are the ports the ports towards the bottom of the headphones include the micro USB and the 3.5 mm headset jack and this is the microphone just beside to it on the side are the buttons there are three buttons in total on this side so as soon as you press this button and hold it for three seconds it would give you the pairing mode and it also says waiting if you are actually wearing it you hear that it first had power on and then said fading so I would turn the Bluetooth on on my phone and then I will try to see if there's any available device on the device and here so this is the me super base wireless headphones that's available for bearing here and and this battery is shown here actually it didn't show mention about that on the booklet it said that it would be supported on the iOS but it shows hundred percent battery here and anyway after using it will let you know whether the battery notification was working or not and you can work with the phone calls media audio and also the contact sharing on this and since that has voice control you can actually give it those voices for the activation and also for some commands now obviously it would take us some time to judge in different conditions by testing out and different conditions and see if the headphones are working well whether the music output is good and whether the bass levels are good enough for the different legendre so we'll be doing the full review in a week or two and then you will be knowing whether these are but I'll tell you what the form factor I did like the form factor here because of the light weight and then these earmuffs that are quite easy to shake move around and fit to your ears and so that's that about the me Super Bass wireless headphones these might be good for the price because 1800 rupees you see quite a lot of options already in the market but these coming from a brand that is known for doing good in the Access Department I would trust this or easily but then yeah we'll let you know in the final review so this was it about the me Super Bass wireless headphones I hope you like this video if you rol share and subscribe to and sometimes for more thanks for watching and until our next video [Music] you

Read more: http://www.TechGadgetsCanada.com
I find it amazing that this may be my first ever review for a pair of on-ear headphones. They’ve never been a favourite for me, since I dislike the fit and feel, generally speaking. But this season, after I tried a whole boatload of gear including speakers and other headphones from Marshall, I found myself loving the brand, so I set aside my prejudice and clapped on the Marshall Major III on-ear wireless headphones for this review. I spent a weekend with them and here’s what I found.

https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/marshall-major-iii-on-ear-bluetooth-headphones-black/13548752?icmp=Recos_4across_cstmrs_ls_vwd&referrer=PDP_Reco

Marshall Major III on-ear wireless headphones

Looks & Styling
These headphones, much like the portable speakers and the Marshall Monitor headphones, have a definite retro look. With cushiony-looking ear cups wrapped in leather-look vinyl fabric and copper accents, like on the multifunction button, these are vintage, but modernized.

The Major III are collapsible and fold up into a fairly compact package so you can travel with them easily. There’s also a microphone built in so you can take calls.

Comfort and Fit

The first time I tried these on, I have to admit I was quite surprised about two things. One, that they were very comfortable, even pressing on my ears they felt soft and surprisingly cushiony. Second, there was a LOT of sound isolation. Sound isolation is the blocking of outside noise using a physical barrier like cushions or padding, where noise cancelling is a digital process that cuts sound bleed.  These headphones have a lot of power to stop most sound bleed, and that was a pleasant surprise.

Setting up Marshall Major III on-ear wireless headphones

Getting these headphones set up and paired was easy.  To get them paired, push and hold the small copper button on the left ear cup for about five seconds; at first you'll hear the sound of them powering up, but keep holding an extra few seconds. Then go to your phone's Settings Menu, then to Bluetooth and look for the Marshall Monitor III in your Bluetooth devices list, then click to connect. 

Sound quality of Marshall Major III on-ear wireless headphones

After my previous Marshall reviews I wasn't at all surprised that these headphones sound very good. The bass is quite strong and really resonant. Vocals were clear and the headphones sound quite balanced. The high sound quality, combined with the sound isolation make them ideal for travel or commuting, or trying to work distraction-free.


My Test Playlist:
Put your hands where my eyes could see - Busta Rhymes
Chunky - Bruno Mars
Supersonic - Oasis
Rappers Delight - Sugarhill Gang
You need to calm down - Taylor Swift


Call quality: Marshall Major III on-ear wireless headphones

The call quality on these headphones is great. It's clear and static free. I was easily able to hear my callers and my callers said the audio on my end sounded very good too.

Wireless connectivity 
Connectivity is???
The wireless connection on the Marshall Monitor seems really strong. I wandered all over my house and left the phone in my office and there was never a drop—not even a crackle. 

Copper multi-function button 

Marshall put a lot of thought into keeping the design of these headphones clean and streamlined. The small copper multifunction is the chameleon of buttons. Push it in to power on or pair. Click it up or down to adjust volume. Side to side and you're skipping tracks. A quick press when there's an incoming phone call will answer it then hang up, and a double press sends it to voicemail. That same quick press during music playback will pause the sound. The controls are simple, yet natural and intuitive. 

Automatic connection After your initial pairing, the Marshall Monitor Bluetooth headphones will reconnect to that same device once you power them on. I found this worked well, though I was a bit disappointed to see they couldn't be connected to more than one device at a time (like my phone and tablet). 


Battery Life & Charging
The Marshall Major III on-ear wireless headphones have a declared battery life of over 30 hours of playtime on a single charge. My test period wasn’t long enough to fully drain them so I’ll have to take Marshall’s word here.


Overall review of Marshall Major III on-ear wireless headphones

Overall these are pretty great headphones. They sound really good to my ears, they’re reasonably comfortable for on-ear headphones and they look pretty retro cool. If you’re looking for a pair of vintage-styled, on-ear premium headphones, you’ll enjoy these.

for a pair of on ear headphones I'm Erin from tech gadgets canada.com and for Best Buy's blog and on ear headphones have never been a favorite for me since I dislike the fit and the feel of them generally speaking but this season after I tried a whole boatload of gear including speakers and some other headphones from Marshall I found myself loving the brand so I set aside my prejudice and clapped on the Marshall major three on-ear wireless headphones for this review I spent a weekend with them and here's what I found an early heads up though that if you liked this video and find it helpful please hit that like button and consider subscribing since it does help me keep buying music on iTunes these headphones much like the portable speakers and the Marshall monitor headphones have a definite retro look with cushiony looking ear cups wrapped in leather look vinyl fabric and copper accents like on the multifunction button these are vintage but modernized the major threes are collapsible and fold up into a fairly compact package so you can travel with them easily there's also a microphone built-in so you can take calls the first time I tried these on I have to admit I was quite surprised about two things one is that they were comfortable even pressing on my ears they felt soft and surprisingly cushiony second there was a lot of sound isolation sound isolation is the blocking of outside noise using a physical barrier like cushions or padding where noise cancelling is a digital process that cuts sound fleed these headphones have a lot of power to stop most sound bleed and that was a really pleasant surprise for me now getting these headphones set up and paired was easy to get them paired you'll push and hold the small copper button on the left ear cup for about five seconds at first you'll hear the sound of them powering up but keep holding it for an extra few seconds then you'll go to your phone settings menu then to bluetooth and look for the Marshall Monitor 3 in your Bluetooth devices list then you'll click to connect that's it after my previous Marshall reviews I wasn't surprised at all that these headphones sound really good the bass is quite strong and really resonant vocals were clear and the headphones sound quite balanced if a little thin sounding overall the good sound quality though combined with the sound isolation make them ideal for travel or commuting or trying to work distraction free the call quality on these headphones is great it's clear and Static free I was easily able to hear my callers and my callers said that the audio on my end sounded really good to the wireless connection on these headphones seems really strong I was able to wander all over my house and leave the phone in my office and I never had to worry about dropouts or crackles Marshall put a lot of thought into keeping the design of these headphones clean and streamlined the small copper multifunction button is a chameleon push it to power on or to pair click it up or down to adjust the volume side to side in your skipping tracks a quick press when there's an incoming call will answer it and then hang up and a double press will send it to voicemail these controls are simple yet natural and intuitive after your initial pairing the Marshall Monitor bluetooth headphones will reconnect to that same device once you power them on again I found this worked really well though I was a bit disappointed to see that they can't be connected to more than one device at a time basically like my phone and my tablet I will frequently be using my tablet and listening to something my phone rings and I want to take the call and it's nice to be able to switch between them can't do it with these ones the Marshall major three on-ear wireless headphones have a declared battery life of over 30 hours of playtime on a single charge now my test period wasn't long enough to fully drain them so I'm going to have to take Marshalls word for the battery life on these ones overall though these are pretty great headphones they sound really good to my ears they are reasonably comfortable for on-ear headphones and I think they look pretty retro cool too if you're looking for a pair of vintage styled on ear premium headphones I think you're definitely going to enjoy these they sell for about $1.99 Canadian and you can get them of course

video for you guys and that is how to connect to wireless earphones or headphones to your iPhone some Bluetooth earphones or headphones to your iPhone at the same time meaning you can get a dual audio output so you can listen to music watch videos and then have it playback on both those earphones or headphones at the same time so you can share with somebody that you want is truly amazing the best part is you don't need to download anything it's just a simple setup on your iPhone and then you have some awesome controls like individual volume control it's truly amazing I'm gonna show you all of that so let's go ahead and begin okay guys so let's begin and the first thing you need is an iPhone or an iPad because this process also works with an iPad if you want you running iOS 13.1 or later I honestly recommend 13.2 but it also works with iOS 13.1 okay and if you're using an iPad iPad OS then 13.1 or later okay so that's pretty much it so if you're updated to the correct version you're gonna be able to do it so of course they're gonna need to open bluetooth and then I'm gonna manage your devices because we're gonna need to actually connect to both your headphones so both the headphones you want to actually listen to okay so both at the same time this is a very important thing for now this process only works for Apple branded headphones or earphones so I have here air plots and then the Beats Studio 3 so 4 beats actually you need to have a slightly newer beats so beats they have the h1 or w1 chips okay so like these ones so in the future I'm sure they will work with any headphones or or our earphones but for now only with Apple branded earphones okay Bluetooth earphones or headphones alright so I have them both here because they have been previously connected of course so then all you have to do is connect the air pots so then for the air pause you can just like open the lid and then remove them from the case okay the normal process okay so there you have it they're connected as you guys can see and for the beats all you have to do is turn them on so I'm just gonna turn them on right here so they're on as you guys can see we of the LED and then they're not gonna connect automatically of course because you already have the the airport right there so you're gonna need to manually connect them so both of them are on one of them is connected which is the airports and now all you have to do is open your control center okay and then you're gonna like tap and hold on this card right here for your audio and then tap on airplay as you guys can see and then I have both my headphones right here alright so as you guys can see I can just actually go ahead and tap on one of those and then I have the option to share audio so it is connected to my airport as you guys can see it is not connected to my beats yet so all I have to do is share audio and then share audio with the beats as you're seeing right there so share audio connecting so now it's connected to both devices as you guys can see and then there you have it it's connected to my airport's and it is connected to my beats and as I showed you I can individually select the audio the volume amount that I want so so that's pretty much it but of course you want to see it in action so let me show you in action so I'm gonna open right here a YouTube video so this is a YouTube video of myself of course and then I'm gonna play it alright so it is playing and then I'm just gonna show that the audio is coming from the airport's let me let me put the volume in maximum okay so you guys can hear from the microphone so volume in maximum and here from the airports can hear it I'm put here on my microphone and then from the beats so beats right here I'm putting here next to my microphone so as you guys can see they're coming from bump from both devices at the same time and of course it works on any actual audio audio that's coming from the iPhone so YouTube Apple music Spotify absolutely anything any audio that's coming from your iPhone is gonna go through both those devices that I just showed you right now so airports and my beats my Beats Studio so

wireless|earbuds|Tech,2020-10-07 10:22:46.632333," [Music] I've always had a bit of a love-hate relationship with truly wireless in your headphones there's no denying how useful these devices are but I just haven't found one that I really liked the ones I've tried usually either suffer from poor audio quality poor battery life or poor connectivity sometimes all three and of course it really doesn't help that my ears are just so picky when it comes to in your headphones because so many of them just don't fit but then I got to try Sony's brand new WF 1000x mark three headphones and let's just say that they are actually incredible now I guess I shouldn't be surprised because Sony's no stranger to the audio game and the WUF 1000x month threes are their latest entry into the truly wireless headphone segments but they're entering the market in a little bit of a disadvantage right now because truly wireless earbuds have been around for quite a long time now and a lot of smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung have their own variants that you don't work well with their smartphones you've got the Apple earpods obviously sort of toothbrush in your ear design they've got a galaxy butts which I actually have been using for quite a while now in fact they're right here these low guys so these are the galaxy bugs you can see really smell truly Wireless also and working well with a smartphone or mobile device is crucial when it comes to something that's all about portability because people are almost always going to use something like this with their smartphone however if you look at Sony's current track record with smartphones you can definitely see that they are a little behind their competition which means that they can't leverage that convenience as a strength first thing about the WUF 1000x mark 3 besides having a longer and more complicated more difficult to remember name is that these have something none of those earbuds and that secret sauce is something called active noise cancellation or ANC yes that magical thing that some headphones are able to do to almost entirely drown out loud ambient sounds which is why I'm in this really noisy train somewhere in Japan traveling from a shinjuku to Chichibu because Sony doesn't want to just tell me that their new headphones are good they actually want to show me how good they really are now if you're unfamiliar with what active noise cancellation is it's not the same as passive noise cancellation you know the kind of isolation you get just by getting a pair of headphones to fit tightly in or over your ears active noise cancellation actually sees the headphones hype a specific second sound that's designed to cancel out stuff like ambient noise so a good pair gets quiet like really quiet this is possible on the WF 1000x mark 3 because it has sony's very own HD noise canceling processor called eq n1e working in tandem with a couple of microphones dqn 1e is able to detect ambient noise in your surroundings and then immediately cancel them out traditionally anc is a feature you'd find on large over-ear headphones so the fact that sony is able to do this on something as small as the WF 1000 x mark 3 is already very impressive but what is truly spectacular is the quality of noise cancellation you're able to get for my money the best anc headphones in the market right now are sony's very own WH 1,000 X Mark threes and what really impressed me was how much of that experience the company was able to transfer over to a pair of headphones that are just a fraction of the size the smaller WF 1000 x mark 3 headphones have pretty much the same noise cancellation profiles you have the ambient sound mode that actually pipes in audio from the outside then you can turn off and see if you want to save battery and finally you have noise cancelling turn it on and you get a kind of sound it's almost like the noise is being sucked out of your ears but of course it doesn't mean that you're completely isolated from all noise ENC as magical as it is isn't magic it works best when your ambient sound is constant so sudden loud noises don't get blocked as well and as good as they are DW f 1000 x mark threes I still don't think that they're quite on the level of the larger WH 1000 X Mark threes almost by design these earbuds are already a step behind their over ear brothers I don't know if you've eaten anything with in ear headphones on before but you're chewing and slurping sounds really loud your own voice is also amplified as is your walking and breathing and these are not problems you'll ever have to face with over ear headphones but of course the trade-off is that the Oh your cans are much bigger in size still the fact that they're able to retain what I feel is about 80% of the anc capabilities of the bigger hip phones is truly an impressive feat however while ANC is cool and all these are still first and foremost truly wireless earbuds so it would be pointless if they sucked at being headphones let's start with audio quality now don't be mistaken these aren't designed to sound like in-ear monitors and when I asked Sony about how they tune their headphones their answer was that they wanted to give users the best enjoyment when listening to music and lastly I think they sound great so I've been using the Samsung Galaxy buds for quite a while and they're basically my only in here truly Wireless pair of headphones and I always thought they sounded quite lame but I wasn't prepared for how lame they actually sounded compared to this the WUF 1000 X Mark threes have a very full and rich sound to them that indeed makes music listening fun the bass line is front and center without being overwhelming and that does a lot to make things sound funny they have that Sony sound signature to them in a way that makes them sound a lot like the larger WH 1000 X Mark threes but you know I wouldn't call myself an audiophile I just know what I like and what I don't and I think a lot of you will like how these sound too of course with in-ear headphones the important thing to get the full experience is to ensure you have a good fit I was probably the most nervous about this aspect because if they didn't fit then I wouldn't be able to review them but you can really tell that these are high-end headphones simply by the number of ear tips that they include in the box you get four pairs of silicon tips in varying sizes and three pairs of foam tips to boot thankfully after a little fiddling I finally got a tight seal largest silicon tip I really appreciate it when manufacturers go to these additional lengths just to make sure everyone gets a good fit so kudos Unni that being said there is one aspect about the ergonomics of these in-ear headphones that I don't enjoy the headphones have a little bit of an L shape to them and when I wear them securely the little corner of the L actually pinches the small protruding part of my ear that google tells me is called the tragus I didn't notice the pinching at all while I was wearing them but when I took them off after a couple of hours my ears were actually really sore and that's a shame because for the most part these ear buds are actually really comfortable but again not all ears are the same shape so you may never encounter this problem with that out of the way let's move on to connectivity and battery life sony's WF 1000 x mark 3 headphones take a little bit of a different approach when it comes to bluetooth connectivity rather than connecting to one but and then relaying the sound these Sony headphones transmit audio to both earbuds simultaneously which they say helps reduce latency another common problem with Bluetooth buds I was a little skeptical at first but I have to say that the connection was very solid throughout my testing Sony lets you switch between two connection modes in their smartphone app allowing you to prioritize either sound quality or a stable connection in my experience sound quality works well if you're not moving through an area with a lot of wireless signals like you know during my train ride but when I was walking through town I had to switch to prioritizing a stable connection otherwise the audio would cut out very frequently in general though I really didn't have much to complain about when it comes to connectivity it hardly ever cut out for me when I was prioritizing a stable connection but the audio quality still sounded fine to my ears plus when I was watching videos on my smart phone I didn't really experience any noticeable delay between the visuals happening on-screen and the audio that I was listening to there was only one instance I think where the earbuds were a touch but simply resetting the connection fixed it for me so I'd say that when it comes to latency Sony really held up their end of the bargain unfortunately I can't say the same about battery life so any quotes up to six hours of life on a single charge with ENC turned on but in my experience I was getting a lot closer to five hours I mean it's still pretty darn good if you consider the fact that other earbuds of this kind get about the same amount of play time without a and C one unique thing I noticed about the WF 1000x Mark threes is that these buds don't run out of battery at the same rate and if one site runs out earlier you can actually still listen to the other side which I guess is kind of neat I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the sony WF 1000 X Mark threes I think they sound great they are well built and they've got some of the best active noise cancellation that I've heard on any pair of headphones I also grew to like the way they look and how securely they fit into my ears despite not featuring any wingtips or straps I tried my best to shake them off with intense hit banging but ultimately was unable to of course it's not perfect I think the case is also a little too big to not feature wireless charging and if you were hoping to wear them in the rain you might want to reconsider because these don't come with any IP or splash rating I did wear them in a drizzle in Tokyo once and they turned out fine but I can't recommend that you do the same but at the end of the day I think the biggest thing that will give people pause when considering buying these headphones is the price tag 949 again that's a lot of money for a pair of headphones especially one like this I mean if you compare it to stuff like you know I see buds which are like half the price even the airports are cheaper but none of those have noise cancellation so how important is that to you that's really important then this is truly a one-of-a-kind product and it's a one-of-a-kind product that really really works and that's not something you can say every day sure there are quite a lot more expensive but that extra cost isn't for nothing it's not like you're paying a batch tax or anything like that you're paying more

my name is Matt and today we're looking at another pair of blue do headphones these ones are the f2 fate the second generation oval over ear design which is primo because I'm liking the over here I mentioned before I was actually talking about on ear and I were and I actually said over here I want to apologize now I'm not going to make that mistake again I'm only human anyway so these ones are bluetooth 4.2 they do have active noise cancellation just like all the other blue Tio's that we've we've reviewed here which is great and they work fantastically and I'm definitely going fantastically is that a word it is now and I'm going to test out the fantastically ANC you can actually connect the two devices at once these have about a 16 hour in use battery life which that's pretty good with only an hour and a half of charge time and not only that but a standby time which means basically it's turned on and it's just sitting there it's not doing anything there's no signal going to it 650 hours of just sitting there so if you forget to turn them off vector flow technology which basically means that it has good air flow it allows it to it sounds good this is all broken down for you go ahead and pause that and just memorize this we're going to have a we're gonna have a pop quiz later let's open it holy okay I was not expecting that look at this thing that is an actual case fantastic box it's got a carabiner on there for those who have been watching for a while I've got it down now these are carabiners very cool case nice red pepper it's a solid case it's not like super hard but it's a you know cut that it's tough those look pretty mo okay first off it actually comes with a pouch for the cables this must be some really good cables we got a about a four and a half foot 3.5 millimeter to USB C type cable and then we got a four foot USB to USB C type and these are heavy-duty that's that flat cable I love these or die so strongly took really good capable down here for now we're done with you pouch cool alright headphones oh boy oh man they came all especially packaged and everything like that they got a nice foam cover around them okay so we've got that synthetic leather I yeah no yeah synthetic leather very cushioning this is going to be very who's going to be a comfortable set of headphones okay so it looks like all of this is made out of aluminum when you go to adjust it you can you can find your number super cushiony ear pads I love a good cushioning ear pad on the main unit you've got your anc switch so yeah it's got a little power so when you turn that on your active noise cancellation comes on then you get your power button your USB C port that looks like your microphone and your up-and-down volume oh my god these are great oh yeah and it look good I mean I make these look good but they look good let's try that active noise cancellation oh I just kicked in Wow oh it's so weird and you can still hear stuff but the like all the ambient noise is gone blue TOF as a booyah that's actually not too bad since I didn't see any information on how far the distance is I'm going to just go ahead and test it want some line is tech tips all right okay so over 50 feet with absolutely no skipping no jumping nothing solid really solid signal like a phone go call my girl hello hey you can hear yourself oh no bueno but how do I sound though I mean other than other than that do me a small favor you just call me right back and just just to see if you can hear yourself hello can you hear me okay can you hear yourself no okay cool awesome all right that just must have been a weird signal whatever okay cool so she said they sounded really good she said that it didn't sound like I was on anything so the microphone is actually really good comfort wise Wow the top here very very cushiony very comfortable you could definitely use these for a long period of time the ear cushions extremely comfortable I mean look how cushiony and then lovely those are it's definitely going to last a lot longer than some of that stiffer stuff I mean you could tell by feeling it that it's made with the with some love for sure sound wise okay so I've heard louder before they don't get like super loud I was able to crank it up and enjoy it just fine the highs in the mid that both give those like an 8 now the bass is low and smooth it's not real punchy it's not real it's not real heavy it's kind of heavy sound so that I give an 8 also the design I think is really cool I like the slick all black and metal I mean you could tell they used good materials with this headset I gotta say blue tio again I'm enjoying blue tio headphone they're fantastic they're well-made they're comfortable you can tell that they're made out of good quality materials this thing as a distance of I don't know what but it's beyond 50 feet or so but anyway guys that's it I'm going to leave a link down in the description below you guys know what to do go check it out for yourself

like a bluetooth but because that's the only way to use it you can't use it with a 3.5 millimeter a jack either with your phone or just connect it to your PC and then also the included micro USB is only for charging it doesn't allow audio pause through through that you can't charge it and then use it wirelessly but yeah that's the only option is Wireless with the 2.4 gigahertz receiver so definitely don't lose that that's for the wireless range just like the previous version it is around a 40 feet which in real world scenario is around you moving to one or maybe two rooms away I was able to get around a one room between a double breaker bowl without any issues and even sometimes going outside but not too far of course but it's mostly for indoor use anyway also just a mention don't put the USB receiver behind your PC or below anything because it might lose connection or have some audio drops so yeah just keep that in mind as well moving on to Bachelor life Crusader states that it does have 16 hours of a use but in reality you're probably gonna get around 10 to 12 hours I was able to get around 2 days of partial use without needing to charge it again so it's definitely good enough then getting into sound quality it looks like Chris Harris still using the exact same 50 a millimeter neodymium drivers compared to the HS seventies which I'll see do not have any complaints on they do sound quite good with a decently balanced frequency range but it does have a tad a bit more at a little lower end which I'll see kind of do prefer for a gaming headsets as for gaming you do of course have your virtual 7.1 option if you wanted to enable that in the PC but afore she it doesn't work on PlayStation 4 only for PCs so then I'm moving on to the microphone you do get a nice detachable available a mic with a nice wind muff as a well which can take off but it's going to help reduce some of those pops and this when the hotter the microphone now the microphone looks to be a tiny bit different compared to the previous HS 70s mic but yeah I don't think it's gonna be that much necessarily again I don't have the exact mic to compare it to but they do say that this mic does have a noise cancellation boards in so you guys can hear how it sounds there is some noise in the background going on outside but nothing like too crazy and then also you do have some some room or some hissing going on but it's also not too crazy now let's quickly just type on a chair makes a brown switch keyboard over here so you guys can hear how that sounds so it is still quite unnoticeable so the noise cancellation isn't necessarily the greatest but luckily inside like OBS or stream labs you do have your annoys gates and so on that you can apply to help reduce that anyway but all in all the microphone definitely isn't a bad it's good enough to just a chatter for your friends maybe if you want to stream you can still use it but of course external a USB microphone or condenser microphone would be best for that then finally just for the IQ software you do have the standard controls that alike adjusting your EQ settings your mic and side zone of volumes auto shutdown and then also seeing your battery alive nothing too crazy there because also again in the states it doesn't have any RGB which is probably a good thing so the in conclusion the i-270 Pro is definitely one of the better wireless a budget at gaming haters currently on the market just like the head with H's 7c and I wouldn't say that you need to sell your HSA ability to buy the newer version it does have that big of a differences between the two but a nice little upgrade that I did add wasn't much appreciated now just like I mentioned with the ACS of 50s when I reviewed these ones the headset is almost a perfect the only graphs that I still have with the HSM NT process of well is that my ears do still scratch against the driver wall I would like to see some padding against that kind of like you get on the HyperX clouds they're super comfortable and I just add a tiny bit of extra padding against the driver wall so your ears don't scratch against that and ear Tate's you so that is one of things and also finally they could just add a 3.5 millimeter jacket - they hate it so that if you wanted to take it in public or somewhere else you can actually use it on your phone or whatever and still be able to actually listen to music or watch movies on it something like that just using it in wireless mode you can use it with a USB adapter but honestly just adding a 3.5 millimeter jack I don't think it's that big of a problem but now that's pretty much it a big thanks to Coursera for sending the HD 70 pros over for review again subscribe if you want to see me comparing the the agency materials to the avoid elites to consider again pretty much the exact same price point so subscribe for that but anyway that's what you guys if you did enjoy this review please like share for crabbin comment like always and then I will check all of you next time just [Music]

welcome to another product review today we're going to take a look at the underarm or sport wireless strain headphones as you might expect these own ear headphones are engineered by JBL they will release you lie of this year and you can find them on most major retailers for about two hundred US dollars right upfront I'm going to tell you that I'm extremely pleased with these headphones after using them for a couple weeks I'm actually going to say these are the best headphones I have ever use in this category and I'm going to tell you why before diving into the details of this product it is important to understand its purpose the sport Wireless strand headphones are specifically designed for workouts whether you're going to the gym working at home and even doing any sort of exercise outdoors you will appreciate some of the features that were included in this package at two hundred dollars these headphones are prized as a premium product and that's exactly the first impression you get when you look at the packaging but before moving any further let's do a proper unboxing [Music] apart from the headphones the package also includes a microUSB charging cable a 3.5 millimeter audio cable a few manuals a carrying case and a 12-month premium membership to the underarmor MapMyFitness app taking a closer look right away you will notice that these come with a very nice rugged texture I cannot speak for long-term durability yet but from a build quality standpoint these feel really nice and I can tell they can take the wear and tear workouts or sport activities you get the JBL and Under Armour logos on both sides of the device on the very top you can see the own there are more branding it's a little dark to see on camera but it actually looks really nice overall you will notice a black and grey theme which I'm very happy with but keep in mind there's another version available which has a black and red combination it is always good to have different options available looking at the inner headband you will notice the unique on there are more fast dry and fabric which is perfect for the gym or outdoor activities and I have to say it is very comfortable as well the ear cushions are also made of the same fabric and they can actually be removed in case you want to rinse them off after a workout moving on to the buttons and ports if you look at the bottom of the device you will see the microUSB charging port on the left side on the right side you get an additional port in case you want to use the provided audio cable the small tabs are a little difficult to remove but I do appreciate the fact that they try to keep everything a sweat-resistant as possible on the right side you will find the power button which you have to hold for 2 seconds to turn the headphones on or off volume controls and a play/pause button which also allows you to take phone calls on the go another special feature about the underarm or train headphones is a talk through technology essentially if you're working out and you're trying to talk to or listen to somebody else you can easily press on the underarm or logo located on the right side of the device and the audio volume levels will immediately be lower allowing you to listen to the other person so there's no need for you to remove your headphones at the time now let's talk about performance to be clear by the time and draft in this review I have been using these headphones for about a month and a half for weight training and cardio workout to the gym so I have a pretty decent idea of how they perform as somebody that enjoys working out five to six days a week I also understand and appreciate a lot of the features included in this product from a sound quality perspective these are a big wind the underarms or train headphones offer a rich bass experience and clear and loud sound levels that will really help you concentrate on perform on your workouts and let's be clear you're not going to get the same bass and audio quality that you find another high in on ear headphones on the market but when it comes to sport headphones these are definitely on the top of their class they are comfortable relatively light and they offer a very secure fit I found these better suited for weight training or similar activities you can use them for running or for other cardio workouts but personally I usually go with lighter less bulky headphone options for any high intensity cardio activity battery life has been outstanding JBL claims up to 16 hours of use on a full charge and you can get one hour of workout time when just a five minute charge which is very convenient I thought the power cable included was a little short but this is not a major issue the Bluetooth connection and range has been pretty solid so far some of the negatives about these headphones include the lack of noise cancellation technology and the lack of sound settings customization through the use of a gap at the $200 price point these are features that you will normally spec in today's market overall I'm very happy with the owner armoire wireless trained headphones and this device has become my favorite accessory for my weekly workouts I'd recommend you go ahead and check them out I hope you found this video helpful and if you did don't forget to like this video and subscribe for future content thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one

269,Y4OZihf8iLo,Andy Slye,UCV2NstswrQwI5AnRtR3Y4yA,Sound Blaster Jam Wireless Headphones Review,"Creative Sound Blaster Jam Review: Best wireless headphones under $50
Buy on Amazon ► http://geni.us/tvnr1oV

If you know me or you’ve seen some of my videos you know that I’m a big fan of wireless devices. I'm also a fan of Sound Blaster products as I've done a couple reviews of their Bluetooth speakers in the past. That's why I wanted to do this video review of the Sound Blaster Jam Bluetooth headset.

These are wireless headphones but not only can you connect them via Bluetooth you can also connect them via NFC if you have an NFC-enabled device. For me I've just been using the Bluetooth option because I have an iPhone 6. That’s all I've been using as I've been testing this headset for the past week. The Sound Blaster Jam headset comes with a red USB cable to charge it. I really wish it came with a power adapter so you could charge it anywhere, but you have to charge it through a USB port on your computer. The cool thing is you can use these headphones to listen to your computer's audio while they're charging.

After the first initial Bluetooth connection to your device these headphones will automatically pair with your device in the future when you turn it on. They're very easy to use. Just use the button on the right side of the headphones. It’s an all-in-one button. Hold it down for power on and power off. It also has a play and pause button and volume control buttons so you can control your device right from the headphones.

The first best feature of the Sound Blaster Jam is the battery. The battery life is extremely long. When I first got the headphones I charged them for about 1 hour and since that initial charge I haven’t had to charge it since. I've been listening through the Bluetooth connection for almost 15 hours. 860 minutes to be exact. I’m loving how long the battery has been lasting.

My second favorite feature about the Sound Blaster Jam is how lightweight and comfortable it is. The first thing I noticed was it’s made entirely out of plastic, and it feels kind of cheap. It feels like I could probably break it in half if I tried, but the plastic is what makes it so lightweight. When I put these on I don't even know that I’m wearing them, that’s how light it is. At one point I wore it for about 5 hours straight, and I had no ear strain at all when I was wearing them. It feels like wearing air. The soft padded ear cushions for your ears make these so comfortable to wear as well. I wore these around my apartment, to the gym, on a treadmill, while working out, and shooting basketball. No problem whatsoever.

The sound quality is pretty decent for how small, lightweight, and affordable the Jam is. Obviously these don't produce the best most high-quality crisp sound like you would hear from a pair of Audio-Technica ATH-M50’s for example. But in the $50 price range you’re not going to find much better sound quality than what the Sound Blaster Jam gives. There’s also a Bass button on the right side of the headphones and when it’s enabled it gives a little bit of a bass boost within the headphones. I was not a big fan of that because when I enabled the bass boost it seemed like it boosted it a little too much for my liking. I usually listened to songs without the bass boost on. But if you're a bass head then you're probably going to like the bass boost feature.

There’s also a built-in microphone so when people call you can just answer right from the headset itself and talk into the microphone on the headset. When I tested the microphone out I used it on my iPhone 6 to call somebody else on an iPhone and they said they could hear a slight echo whenever I was using the Jam microphone. I don't know if that was because of the microphone on the Jam or just my connection from my iPhone. But there is a microphone built into these headphones that you can use for calling.

Overall I'm a fan of the Sound Blaster Jam Bluetooth headset. I think this is going to be my go-to headphones whenever I go to the gym to workout or if I'm going grocery shopping and I want to listen to a quick podcast. They're not going to replace my professional studio headphones that I use for video editing but these are perfect if you're looking for a cheap Bluetooth headset that is extremely lightweight, that has long battery life, and is very comfortable.

Sound Blaster Jam review. Let's do it. What's up guys, welcome to MyTechMethods. My name is Andy. This is my review over the Sound Blaster Jam Bluetooth headset. So if you know me or you’ve seen some of my videos before you know that I’m a big fan of wireless devices. Anything without cords or wires I'm a big fan of. I'm also a big fan of Sound Blaster products as I've done a couple reviews of their Bluetooth speakers in the past. That's why I wanted to do this video review of the Sound Blaster Jam Bluetooth headset, and as always for your convenience I will leave the link to the best price on Amazon in the description below so you can check that out if you want to get these headphones. These are wireless headphones but not only can you connect them via Bluetooth you can also connect them via NFC if you have an NFC-enabled device. For me I've just been using the Bluetooth option because I have an iPhone 6. That’s all I've been using as I've been testing this headset for the past week. The Sound Blaster Jam headset comes with a red USB cable so this is how you charge the headphones. I really wish they came with a power adapter so you can charge them anywhere, but it just comes with a USB cable and that’s how you charge it. You can charge it through a USB port on your computer. But the cool thing is you can use these headphones to listen to your computer's audio while they're charging if you want to do that. After the first initial Bluetooth connection to your device these headphones will automatically pair with your device in the future when you turn it on and Bluetooth is enabled on your device so that is good. They're very easy to use. You just use the button on the right side of the headphones. It’s an all-in-one button. You can hold it down for power on and power off. It also has a play and pause button and volume control buttons on the side of the headphones as well so you can control your device right there from the headphones on the right. Now let’s talk about the two best features about the Sound Blaster Jam headset. The first best feature is the battery life. The battery life is extremely long. When I first got the headphones I charged them for about one hour and since that one-hour initial charge I haven’t had to charge it since. I've been listening through the Bluetooth connection for about 15 hours. 860 minutes to be exact. So 860 minutes of Bluetooth playback from my iPhone 6 using the Jam headset, and I haven’t had to charge it since. So the battery life is extremely long. That is one of my favorite features. Now my second favorite feature about the Sound Blaster Jam is how lightweight and comfortable these headphones are. The first thing I noticed about the Sound Blaster Jam headphones is that they were made entirely out of plastic, and it felt kind of cheap. It felt like I could probably break them in half if I tried, but the plastic is what gives it one of its best features and that's how lightweight these things are. When you put these things on you don't even know that you're wearing them they're so lightweight. At one point I wore these for about 5 hours straight around my apartment, and I had absolutely no ear strain at all whatsoever when I was wearing them. I completely forgot I was wearing them. They feel like air on top of you. That along with the soft padded ear cushions for your ears make these so comfortable to wear. I wore these, like I said, I wore these around my apartment, wore these to the gym, on a treadmill, working out, playing basketball, shot basketball in them. No problem whatsoever. Now let's talk about the sound quality on the Sound Blaster Jam. The sound quality is pretty decent for how small these headphones are and how lightweight they are and how cheap they are. Now obviously these don't produce the best most high-quality crisp sound like you would hear from something like the Audio-Technica ATH-M50’s for example because those our professional studio headphones and they're also priced a lot higher than the Sound Blaster Jam. In that mid $50 price range you’re not going to find much better sound quality than what the Sound Blaster Jam gives. These headphones have a Bass button on the right side of the headphones that when it’s enabled it gives you a little bit of a bass boost within the headphones. And I myself was not a big fan of that because when I enabled the bass boost it seemed like it boosted it a little too much for my liking. When I was listening to hip-hop songs the bass was just overpowered and got to the point where it sounded a little bit distorted for my taste. So I usually listened to songs without the bass boost on. That's just my liking, but if you're a bass head and you like that bass: that uh uh uh then you're probably going to like the bass boost feature. And the headphones also have a built-in microphone so when people call you can just answer right from the headphones itself and talk into the microphone that's on the headphones. Now when I tested the microphone out I used it on my iPhone 6 to call somebody else on an iPhone 6 and they said they could hear a slight echo whenever I was using that microphone on the Sound Blaster Jam. And yes I tested it myself. I was the caller on the other end and I could hear a slight echo whenever somebody was using the Sound Blaster Jam so I don't know if that was because of the microphone on the Sound Blaster Jam, how the way it is, or just my connection from both of our iPhones. But there is a microphone built into these headphones that you can use for calling. So overall I'm a fan of the Sound Blaster Jam Bluetooth headset. I think this is going to be my go-to headphones whenever I go to the gym or workout or I need something quick to grab to listen to if I'm going to grocery shopping or something and I want to listen to a podcast. I will probably put these on. Obviously they're not going to replace my professional studio headphones that I use for video editing but these are perfect if you're looking for a pretty cheap Bluetooth headset that is extremely lightweight, that has a long battery life, and is very comfortable. So if you're looking for those features in a Bluetooth headset the Sound Blaster Jam is a great choice. I hope you guys enjoyed this review.

tell you they're worth every freaking penny now I'll be sure to leave links to that right down in the description box below make sure you guys check those out and also want to give a special shout out to the subscribers and viewers that suggested these Edifier headphones to me man I'm telling you I couldn't be happier now before we go any further and for full disclosure I went ahead and bought these headphones with my own money for the purposes of this review so with that being said let's dive right in [Music] all right so let's get into the pros and cons of the Edifier w8 3 0 bTW first up and most importantly you guys know how I roll it's gonna be the sound quality these are freaking excellent I put these on first try them out right out of the box pop them on put on my favorite songs you know to do all my testing with and crispy clear sound I mean your mids are nice and warm the highs are super crisp and clear and man the bass dude like I just wasn't expecting it the song the first song that I listened to with it starts off with a lot of vocals and like sounds and stuff shout out to my boy Travis MCP if you don't know this dude I'll leave a link to his channel right up here if you want to check him out he always uses this DJ snake and a lot of gorge song you know you like it it's a toad song for testing you know he's kept talking about it so I was like you know what let me give this song a shot to test out these headphones and see what the hype is man it's an awesome song I test some headphones with and it starts off low but then that bass drops and man these Edifier man they blew me away so as far as the sound quality goes I'm gonna have to give these a 4.5 out of 5 it's not a perfect score and more on that in just a bit secondly we have the comfort man these are incredibly comfortable so they're very like you know you don't feel you don't feel weighed down by them and then they also don't have you know any of that crazy clamping force where it's putting all that pressure on your ears and stuff none of that going on and then they're also very generous in the padding on the headband and on the ear cups themselves so I mean you barely feel them on your head they really got that down as far as the amount of clamping force and I usually have issues with clamping force because I have such a large head so you know I'll put them on stands they can be she tired after a while it usually gets better for me after headphones have broken in you know they do loosen up a bit over time so that gets better for me with these so it's not gonna be an issue because they sit very lightly on my head and I'm a huge fan of that so just based on how light they are and all the cushioning and the comfort overall they're getting a 5 out of 5 on that comfort next up you've got the battery life now they're claiming a 95 hour playback time obviously I have not been able to test that now out of the box they had some battery to them not sure how much but they have some battery to them I've accumulated around 14 hours worth of total playback time so far haven't had any battery warnings haven't had any volume issues so as far as battery life goes I'm gonna say it's good although I haven't managed to pull that 95 hours out of it obviously I don't know who could pull in 95 hours of battery life you know in a short period of time but battery life so far pretty dang good so as far as that goes I'm gonna have to give them a 4.5 out of 5 just because I haven't been able to pull that full 95 out of them it's not a fault of their own but you know just to be conservative four and a half out of five next up you have your microphone quality now these the microphone quality frickin excellent I'll just make a phone call and talk to them when I talk to my wife I'll talk to her and then at the very end I'll say hey how do I sound can you tell that I'm talking to you through headphones as far as these data fires go she couldn't tell the difference between the microphone on these and the microphone on my samsung galaxy s 8 so that's pretty dang good picking it up you know they said there wasn't a ton of background noise or any of that stuff and then when I called the restaurant that I called shout out the Flossie Carter for giving me that idea you know they heard me perfectly I was able to place the lunch order and there was no issues so as far as the mic quality goes yeah baby 5 out of 5 so next up and what I think is a major plus is the fact that they're also foldable and rotatable so you know you can fold them up and you've also got the rotatable cups so if you want to rest them on your shoulders when you take them off your ear stuff like that versatility you know of the way they fit and feel so to me that's a major win you know not a lot of headphones even eat a lot of headphones where they'll do one or the other but not both get foldables or rotatable but these are doing both doing it well and yeah man I think that's a major win for these so I'm gonna have to give them a 5 out of 5 just on that versatility alone in the next step out of the box and which i think is a really nice touch especially for a head film in this price range is the fact that they also included a nice case so they give you a nice hard shell case they also included your cables for charging and your three-and-a-half millimeter audio cable so it's a nice that they threw all that stuff inside especially the case that's a big thing for me I like to keep my headphones nice and safe and yeah I just wish more companies would do that so big ups to Edifier for throwing that case in and then that brings me to the one negative thing which I thought it was a little weird about these headphones and that is when you use them in Wired mode so in Wired mode it's a little it's a little bit weird so the volume level stays the same you know you you still got really good volume they get plenty loud but the weird thing is that there is a sound profile change almost as if the EQ is different when they're wired versus being you know going Wireless so by the EQ change what I mean is it seems like there's less treble and more base when wired which kind of threw me off you know because they sound really good to have a good bass when your dues and I'm a wire in a wireless mode and you know you get all the crispy high as a great mids and you know and good bass and everything you wire them up all of a sudden the bass is boosted but you lose your top end you lose all that all those clear crispy highs so that's kind of a weird thing it's very odd it's a very odd thing I have never experienced that you know usually with headphones that have any sort of loss of sound quality when wired it's usually just overall volume with these it's just like an EQ change which i think is very odd I mean they still sound decent but yeah I just thought I'd point that out to you guys if you guys are people that like to run your headphones in Wired mode they're gonna be in Wired mode they're gonna be Basie you know it's gonna be heavier bass and a little bit less on the treble so in my personal opinion they sound far better in Bluetooth mode than they do in Wired mode so that's why I have to throw that in the con section so as far as wired goes I'm gonna have to give them a three and a half out of five just because of that weird EQ change and you know the loss of the Chris penis and the highs so all in all I'm super happy that you know you guys suggest that these Edifier headphones to me the sound quality the comfort the microphone quality I mean everything is just awesome on these now I got super lucky I picked them up when ollie Express was having a big sale on these I think I got these for right around 48 ish dollars and I mean it took about a month for them to come in but still it was worth it for those price savings but that said even had I paid the full 69.95 er check out the Edifier W 830 BTS these things are freakin legit and they're definitely getting that El Jefe stamp of approval 100% El Jefe approved right here alright people so I'm gonna go ahead and wrap up this review right here let me know what you think of these Edifier headphones have you guys tried Edifier before let me know also if you have any questions or concerns about these leave those down in the comment section as well and I will get back to you guys as soon as possible as always if you guys like this video go ahead and smash that like button you guys didn't like this video go ahead and hit that dislike button that's totally

headphones review|Samsung Level On Pro Review|Samsung Level On Pro|Level On Pro|Level On Pro wireless headphones|Level On Pro headphones|Samsung Level On Pro wireless headphones|Samsung Level On Pro headphones,2020-10-07 10:22:46.632735, this is the Samsung level on wireless Pro and as should be immediately apparent it's a pair of wireless bluetooth headphones while you've seen many of those this pair as active noise cancellation as well as a 24-bit ultra-high quality audio mode only compatible the select Samsung phones that make this a good pick for a loyal Galaxy fans I'm Stephen shank with fawn arena bringing you my full review of the Samsung level on wireless pro headphones Samsung first introduced its level series of audio accessories back in 2015 but lineup that's included models like the level in earbuds level over heavy-duty headphones and these the level on wireless pro while they've been around for a little while now this spring picked up a pair alongside the new Galaxy s8 that's been putting their performance to the test the level on wireless pro is a lightweight folding pair of stereo bluetooth headphones both earpieces twist and turn independently of the headset body and like the band up top are covered in a soft leather like material on the left earpiece we find an analogue in Jack for connecting to non Bluetooth devices while the right side contains the bulk of the controls we've got the microUSB port for charging power and bluetooth pairing switch and a toggle for maybe this headsets most interesting feature active noise cancellation what about volume these are headphones right Samsung pulls the neat trick of building a touch sensitive surface into the side of that right earpiece so i've up-and-down for volume left and right for track advanced and tap to pause it tends to work well but we'd appreciate some more feedback like a tone or something to let you know when you've reached max volume initially the headphones are pretty comfortable but we found that after just a few hours of listening they really didn't play nicely with our glasses pressing the arms and comfortably against our head you can always take a break or maybe you don't wear glasses at all but it's worth keeping in mind setup is as straightforward as any bluetooth headphones should be and you can absolutely just use this pair as is but to get the most out of them you'll want to install the Samsung level app which lets you configure EQ settings setup notification prompts and check them the headphones battery status if you've got a compatible Samsung phone and yet this feature is Samsung only you can also use the level app to engage the ultra-high quality audio mode which interpolates output up to 24 bits per sample that's this models one big selling point and Ferengi eights the pro edition from the regular level on wireless headphones without that engage the audio from these headphones is quite nice and while you're free to augment it with the level apps sound allied EQ all you want it's really not worth your effort and when you finally activate ultra-high quality audio things suddenly sound well pretty much exactly the same honestly that shouldn't be surprising as you can't accurately restore fidelity lost in an original 16-bit recording and few listeners even have ears so keen as the teleview could since things sound good already that's no skin off our back but it does tend to put a damper on the whole point of this Pro Edition we're more interested as though in the active noise cancellation and this really does make a pronounced difference when engaged you'll still hear a low-level white noise but background noises you tend to train your brain to ignore stuff like fans or droning mechanical sounds suddenly vanish into nothingness the suppression here isn't quite as strong as on some competing headphones but it's very very satisfying all the same the only frustrating that came in the form of a recurring clicking noise we'd only hear in the left ear piece and only with noise cancellation turned on battery life is reasonably strong with the level on wireless Pro rated at 10 hours of playback with noise cancellation engaged or 20 hours without our only complaint there is the only way to check on battery status is through the Samsung level app and even then it's only a simple icon style readout that said gives them a charge after every a few listening sessions and you should be just fine Samsung's level on wireless pro makes for a decent set of headphones they've been out for a little while by now so it's already dropped in price in the initial $250 to more like 170 now compared to something like Bose that may sound like a good bargain but you do get what you pay for well B sound good we have heard better and we're a little concerned with how comfortable they are in the long run also that I'm fortunate how the ultra high quality audio mode doesn't do more to enhance the listening experience if you're on a budget you won't be too upset with Samsung's headphones but if you're already spending this kind of money maybe think about spending a little more for something just a bit more robust I'm Stephen take with

They were leaders in semi-wireless headphones and now they have no less than three truly wireless earbuds on offer.  I recently received a pair of the new Jabra Elite 65t truly wireless headphones for review.


These headphones are engineered for calls and music, as opposed to sports use (there's the Elite Active, or Elite Sport for that.)

Setting these headphones up is quite easy.
Conveniently, the earbuds turn on right away when removed from the case, and they'll shut down when you replace them. I love this feature since it helps prolong battery life. Speaking of which, promised battery life on these headphones is up to 5 hours of battery on a single charge, and up to 15 hours in total with the included pocket-friendly charging case. 

There’s no need to start and stop music with a button: when you remove an earbud from your ear while listening to music, the music will automatically pause. I love this feature! 

These headphones are easy to put in and take out and don't require a lot of finessing to manouver, since they don't have any fins to fiddle with.

The right earbud can be used alone for mono playback or for calls. 

I tried the Jabra 65t in a variety of environments, and with a bunch of different music.

I was quite impressed with how good they. Listening to more vocal-forward tracks, the voice was very clear and distinct. The bass was pretty good also; not bone rattling, but it had more of a true sound to it than a vibration. Solid and pleasant.

Overall the sound was clear and crisp. There was no distortion or muddiness at higher volumes, and even at 70% volume it was still pleasant to listen to. 

Jabra’s HearThrough technology uses the built-in microphones to enable you to pay closer attention to your surroundings and engage in conversation without needing to remove the earbuds. 

Overall I really like these headphones. In fact, I was surprised at how much I liked them. The fit is quite comfortable, the battery life is solid, and the sound quality is very impressive.

If you're looking for a solid and reliable pair of truly wireless headphones, these are a good pick I think most folks would be really happy with. 

Jabra Elite 65t sells for $219 CAD and you can find them on Jabra’s website, from places like Best Buy, and here below link up at

world leaders in the semi wireless headphones game and now they have no less than three pairs of truly wireless headphones out I'm Erin for tech gadgets Canada comm and I recently had a chance to try a pair of their newest this is the Jabra elite 65 T I got to spend a few weeks with them and here's what I found these headphones are engineered for calls and music as opposed to sports use there's the elite active or the elite sport for that and you can check out my review of the elite sport here on the youtube channel or on the blog Jabra elite 65 t headphones appear to be designed for office workers or commuters who need to take calls hands-free or who want to listen to music at work or on the train Jabra says these headphones have been designed to have crystal-clear audio they've got four microphones built right in and that's supposed to reduce ambient noise when you're having a conversation and cut back on wind noise Jabra elite 65 t features an IP 55 rated design meaning there's limited protection from low-pressure water and dust you can also push and hold the multifunction button on these earbuds to get instant access to your phone's digital assistant whether that's Siri or Google setting up the Jabra elite 65 T was easy to do it just make sure the right earbud is turned off then push and hold the multifunction button on the right earbud for five seconds until you hear connection instructions inside the earbud and the LED light flashes blue release the button and follow the voice guided instructions to pair your smart phone this will involve going to your phone's Bluetooth menu and selecting the Jabra elite 65 T to pair conveniently the earbuds turn on right away when you remove them from the case and they'll shut down when you replace them I really like this feature since it helps prolong the battery life and speaking of which that promised battery life on these headphones is up to 5 hours of battery on a single charge and up to 15 hours in total with the included pocket friendly charging case to initiate a charge just put the earbuds back in the charging case and close the lid there's an LED light inside the case which doubles as a meter of source which will flash red yellow or green to indicate that your buds current battery status it'll take you about 2 hours to fully recharge them conveniently there's no need to start and stop the music with these with a button or with your smart phone once they're in your ear they'll play and as soon as you take one out it stops when you're done whatever you're doing put them back in and the music resumes automatically you can adjust volume on your smart phone or device or on the earbud there's two tiny nibs on either side of the left ear bud pressing the front nib brings the volume down and pressing it towards the back brings it up you can only control the volume when the sound is playing pressing the left button otherwise we'll get you a verbal battery report there are a set of extra ear gels in the package but where some manufacturers will give you almost a dozen different ear tips gels and fins with Jabra you're really only getting three sizes they're small medium and large one pair is already on the headphones two more in the package trying these on I noticed they're significantly less tight-fitting than the elite sport version which is pretty ear filling and can get a bit uncomfortable these have a nice normal natural fit the with that feeling comes a little less security and more concern of potentially having them fall out that went away quickly enough though and I never had an issue with the buds coming loose on me the charging case is nice and small and easily fits in a pocket I did find the lid a touch sticky to open since it closes pretty securely and there's not much of a notch to pry it open with the other thing about this case is that it's got a rounded bottom so it won't sit flat while it's open which is mildly annoying if you have the desire or the need to just use one of these ear buds at a time you can the right earbud has the capability to be used all by itself I tried the Jabra elite 65 tee with a bunch of different music and in a few different environments overall I was really impressed with the sound quality listening to more vocal forward tracks the voice was clear and distinct the bass was pretty good too not bone-rattling but I had more of a true sound to it than a vibration it was solid and pleasant overall the sound was clear and crisp there was no distortion or muddiness even at higher volumes and even at 70 percent volume it was still pleasant to listen to jabbers hear through technology uses the built-in microphones to hear what's going on around you and direct that into your listening space if you choose now you can turn this on or off using the Jabra app or you can double press the rate multifunction button and that'll shut it off or turn it on as well Jabra really touts the wind resistant properties of these headphones and I had a chance to try this out for myself on a very windy they recently pop them in my ears and went for a walk and made a few phone calls I asked the caller's on the other end if they could hear any ambient noise or any other noise and they all said they couldn't I was actually able to hear the wind blowing past my head and whipping around around me but to my callers on the other end complete silence so chalk one up for Jabra I tried watching youtube videos on my Apple iPhone using the elite 65 T and not surprisingly to me there was a sync issue where audio and video weren't quite matched up now this is very common in truly wireless earbuds but it's frustrating for owners because it limits what you can use the headphones for interestingly I tried them next on my macbook laptop and they worked great now I'm not sure why they'd be able to sync with the smart phone and in sync with the computer because I'm not an engineer so if anyone knows if this is a jabber issue an Apple issue software or something else please post in comments below when I was using these headphones close to either my phone or my laptop I had no problems with them no connectivity issues and no dropouts unfortunately that didn't last when I'd get up and walk away from wherever they were connected to I was really only able to get about 17 to 22 steps away from the device wearing the headphones before I did start to notice dropouts and the music or the sound cutting out overall it was pretty impressed with these headphones by and large I found the fit to be really comfortable the battery life was excellent and the sound quality was really good as well the hear through technology worked really well so I could let in background noise when I wanted to or block it out to focus the 65 t were easy to operate simple to understand they had easy to interpret lights and buttons that were intuitive and worked well if I was going to make some improvements to these headphones it would be to increase the connectivity and the distance I'm able to get away from my device before I was experiencing dropouts but overall I think these are really good headphones and I think they'd be a great mid priced option for people who are looking for something fully Wireless now they sell for about $219 canadian you can find them of course on Jabir's website or from places like Best Buy as

information on the box you have them in different colors also so this one is black have it in blue and gray in the well more of a like green while light green and gray this one is white and black and the one that we already opened was in red and black so let's take a few second and look around the box it has the information that you need is a wire less headphone some pictures and TF card FM stereo radio mp3 player and Bluetooth because inside you don't actually need to have like a iPhone or any kind of device to make it work just take a SD card put it inside and micro SD actually you put it inside with your music and control everything with it so sit tight I'll show you and you will get a power supply also while a power supply it's a charger so let's go ahead and check it out but after that it will work with any kind of Bluetooth device so from 4.1 and going down it will work to work for up to 10 meters so if you leave this in your home you can go in your backyard no problem tap time you can talk for up to 6 hours with a single charge you will be in standard standby time will be 15 hours and yeah you get some hold on with the N number read out function large and small volume adjustment for it is so you can change the music and everything so let's open it up and see what's inside hold on so we will get some instruction also which are pretty basic so how to use it how you will make it work we also get some cable with this so you can plug it and they will work directly so if you want to plug this directly to your iPod well you can just do it with the wire so even if you run out of battery it's super simple just take it out plug it and I will they will continue to work you get your charger which is a standard one so even if you lose the one that you have this one well you can buy it and will cost you around like what 2 bucks so that's pretty dope have that and let's take a look inside the product so nice you can flip it and you can also fold it back and put it in the box or in your backpack and walk with it so that's pretty decent on this one side you have the power on button ok you have the pause and play the next song the song before that you can answer your phone also with this so if you're connected to your phone so you can actually answer some people's calling you and here is the most interesting part is that you have that little SD slot so you can put some SD card inside with your music preloaded and they will play and it's not that expensive around like what under $30 so and they're pretty constant also and very easy to carry around or in your backpack or you can just fold it if you go out a gym this is the way to go because you won't have no wires you don't even have to have a solar phone actually just preload all the music that you want inside press play and you're good to go you can do all of your gym exercise and it won't affect your like ramen or anything because actually will work so let's take my phone out and connect it right

that it's working very well but it's not even let the music right now so hold on they do work pretty well actually and I can pause it if I want to I can press the next song which you can see here will

a phone call right away well like I just answered and they have some microphone on this so people will hear you and everything pretty decent actually for the price it's costing $30 people should definitely get one of those not that expensive and the product is pretty cool it do work very well and you have multiple of function on it so even if the battery are dead like I told you just plug the wires and put it in and you will continue to listen to some music so that was the first model I will put them back and we'll check out the other colors because some people like to see the other colors they are made in so hold on that was the first for second one okay mind you that they're all well packed so if you give this as a gift where you buy it for a store well you can at least be sure that it will come in a premium package so can give it as a gift no trouble and they will look good and if you have small children at home or like teenagers they will probably have some fun with this Wow

happy because it has everything inside you also have the FM radio so even if you don't have some music well you know that you have some FM radio this is perfectly black the cutter that I like the most are the one with the two colors on it but depends on your choice some people like to have multiple colors other only some color so this one in but it's more of a baby blue actually baby blue and gray so any kind of geeky device that you might have so just have to plug it and search for the PCT and you're good to go actually the last but not least the white and the black which are pretty well

Can SleepPhones headphones help you sleep better and more comfortably? I spent weeks testing them. 
Full review & instructions: TechGadgetsCanada.com
Follow me on Twitter & Instagram @ErinLYYC
Some people struggle their whole lives with getting a good night’s rest, and everyone has their own tricks for getting to sleep and staying asleep. If  yours is to wear headphones to block out noise or lull yourself with meditative podcasts or music, you may be one of the ones who’s been using headphones so as not to disturb your partner. But trying to sleep with headphones can be uncomfortable; they hurt your ears and can get tangled overnight. SleepPhones Wireless headphones may be the answer.

SleepPhones headphones have tiny speakers inside the band that sit over and above your ear so there’s nothing sticking in your ear all night to bother you. 

I have to say I didn’t have the easiest time getting SleepPhones set up.

I struggled pairing this device multiple times to several devices, both Apple and Android. Sometimes the SleepPhones would show up in my Bluetooth menu and just not connect. Other times they wouldn’t show up at all. I’d say on average it took me about 20 attempts to connect.

I reached out to Acoustic Sheep, makers of SleepPhones to ask what was up.  It seems a couple things could be at play.  First, they may not pair to more than one device at a time. Second, they may need as hard reset.

One thing I didn’t like is that the sleep phones don’t shut off after your podcast finishes. They WILL shut off if your bluetooth turns off but on their own they stay on all night and were still on in the AM when I woke. I guess that;’s ok if you want all night distraction, but it does eat up battery life meaning I needed to charge them every 2 days or so.

The promised battery life on SleepPhones is about 13 hours, and  they do take three hours to fully charge.  

While each speaker has a tiny paper label on it indicating left and right, those are likely to wear off, so Acoustic Sheep has colour coded the speakers: right has red embroidery on one side and left is green (I’ve also seen a green felt pad and red felt pad in place of the embroidery in different models). They go back into the band with the white felt side against your head.

I was pretty impressed with the wireless range of the SleepPhones.  I did some tests where I walked away from the headphones while listening. I was able to get to the other side of the apartment, with walls in between me and my phone, and still get a clear signal. 

SleepPhones don’t make any claims about phenomenal audio quality but I was pleasantly surprised at just how good they did sound. The audio was clear and sharp and as far as I’m concerned, using these for travel or for being lulled to sleep, they’re just great.  

SleepPhones comfort and fit

VO FIT
I chose the One Size Fits Most band, which is actually labelled Medium on the inside,  and found it fit me well; not too tight and not too loose.

SleepPhones are quite comfortable to wear and to sleep in.  I’m a side sleeper, and as such have never been able to wear headphones to bed. I do listen to podcasts to fall asleep each night, so my solution is to play audio from my iPad’s speaker on low volume from the bedside table. Fortunately, my husband doesn’t mind, but I’d rather not subject him to noise. 

With SleepPhones, I can lay comfortably on either side, and still listen to my shows, without disturbing my husband. Brilliant! There’s also no cords to get tangled up in overnight, another annoyance.

SleepPhones can also double as a sleep mask. One end of the band is significantly wider than the other; and if you turn it around, you can use it to cover your eyes, though you’ll probably need to readjust the speakers.


I was quite happy with my SleepPhones.  They’re definitely comfortable, and I didn’t find the band too warm.. I like the fact they’re very flat, and don’t press on my head or my ears while I’m sleeping on my side. They’re completely distraction and annoyance-free when it comes to sleeping with headphones on.

I was pleasantly surprised at the audio quality and really love the idea of these for travelling, for blocking out ambient noise, or for falling asleep to meditative sounds.


If I had a complaint, it was that these weren’t easy to pair, and it wasn’t clear to me that there are limitations on pairing to more than one device at a time. Now that I know how they work and their limitations, it’s easier, but initially it was frustrating. I also wish they had a shut off timer to preserve battery life.

Overall, I’d recommend these headphones if you like to sleep while listening to music, podcasts and more. They’re comfortable, easy to wear and they sound great.

SleepPhones Wireless sell for about $99USD from SleepPhones website.",1,65287,130.0,1055.0,28.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TxmtGrdGnVw/hqdefault.jpg,sleepphones|wireless|headphones|sleeping|best|for sleep|side sleeper|back sleeper|listen to|how to|review|erin|vlogger|blogger|canada|tech|technology|how to fall asleep,2020-10-07 10:22:46.632932, some people struggle their whole lives just trying to get a good night's sleep and everyone has their own tips and tricks to get to sleep and stay asleep one of those can be listening to things like music podcasts or guided meditations at night but of course if you do that and you've got a husband or a wife you risk keeping them awake with your audio the answer then is headphones but headphones particularly like these can really hurt your ears after a while especially if you're a side sleeper and of course the cords can definitely get tangled up in all the bedding I'm Erin from tech gadgets canada.com and I may have found a solution for people that like to listen to something to fall asleep these are sleep phones and their soft padded wireless headphones with little flat speakers inside they're designed to be worn while you're asleep and they're perfectly flat so they're not going to ache or distract you or be uncomfortable I had a chance to spend a couple of weeks testing out sleep phones and this is my review sleep phones headphones have tiny speakers inside the band that sit over and above your ear so there's nothing sticking in your ear all night to bother you I'll give you a little look at what's inside the sleep phones headband here there's a Bluetooth module which is your connection to your phone tablet or device and it's wireless it's got a couple buttons on it which allow you to turn the power on and off put it into pairing mode and turn the volume up or down and skip tracks it connects via microUSB and that's how you recharge it also in here that little module connects to what are in essence the small flat speakers which act as the earbuds for your sleep phones they're very small they're very quite thin and they're wrapped in this felt so they're designed to be perfectly comfortable I have to say I didn't have the easiest time getting the sleep phone setup you're supposed to push and hold the square button for about five or six seconds to enter pairing mode you'll hear a three-tone sound and then some beeping then you head to your phone's bluetooth menu and select acoustic sheep a long tone should confirm your connection I definitely struggled pairing the sleep phones to a couple of different devices I tried with both Apple devices and an Android device as well and I'd say on average it took me about 20 times to get them paired they wouldn't show up in the bluetooth menu sometimes other times they would show up in the Bluetooth menu but then I'd get a connection error I thought this was a bit weird so I reached out to acoustic sheep the makers of sleep phones to ask what gives and it seems that they're not the best perhaps at pairing to more than one device at a time which might have been the problem so if you want to connect them to more than one device you'll either need to shut the Bluetooth off on the first device you've paired them to connect them to your second device and then hopefully that'll work other times you might need to do a hard reset I'm gonna put full instructions on how to do all of these things and acoustic sheeps tips and tricks for getting paired on the blog at tech gadgets Canada comm just so we don't have to take up a whole bunch of time with detailed instructions in this video so head over there and check it out if you do need some help when I tried the sleep phones on for the first time I put them on and I felt like they didn't quite fit right I felt like the speaker's like they are now we're not even close to being above my ear now I can kind of feel where they are inside the band and I was trying to shimmy them forward a bit to get them into the right place but I was worried about breaking the cabling inside I didn't know what was going on so if I can open these up for you and show you there's actually plenty of cable inside so you have the ability to adjust them to quite a large extent and if you just reach into the band and shuffle them along you can move them forward or backwards into the band to get them in exactly the right place so that they're gonna be perfectly comfortable and the audio will sound great for you one thing I didn't love about the sleep phones is that there's no auto shutoff on these when I listen to podcasts at night typically using my Apple iPad when the podcast is done after about an hour the iPad shuts off and goes to sleep now when I use the sleep phones with the iPad to listen to these podcasts when I wake up in the morning the Bluetooth module would still be on so I'm listening to about an hour of podcast and then it's basically staying on for the remainder of the night until I wake up and shut it off in the morning sometimes I forgot to do that so I was really blowing the battery on it to me it would be great if there was an auto shutoff feature for the sleep phones otherwise you'll have to remember to shut them off each morning the promised battery life on sleep phones is about 13 hours and they do take about three hours to fully charge to charge them remove them from the band and plug in the bluetooth module and you'll see a red light when the light goes out they're ready so you might be wondering how you know when you remove the Bluetooth module from the band to charge it how do you put it in the right way so that you can use the volume up and down buttons correctly the easiest way according to acoustic sheep is to match the logo with the logo on the Bluetooth module so long as both are facing up everything works correctly the sleep phones band is washable and if you've taken the speakers and the bluetooth module out to wash the band here's how you get them back in properly well each speaker has a tiny paper label on it indicating left and right those are pretty likely to tear off so acoustic sheep has color coded the speaker's right has red embroidery on one side and the left has green they go back into the band with the white felt side against your head on each appropriate side sleep phones don't make any claims about phenomenal audio quality but I was pleasantly surprised at just how good they did sound the audio was clear and sharp and as far as I'm concerned using these for travel or being lulled to sleep they're just great I'd say sleep phones are pretty comfortable to wear and to sleep in I'm a side sleeper and as a result I've never been able to wear regular headphones because I find they just hurt my ears after a while so these are an excellent solution now I do listen to podcasts each night to help me fall asleep and what I've been doing up until now is playing them on the speaker of my Apple iPad and falling asleep to that which is great for me but not so great for my husband who is subjected to whatever I'm listening to when he comes to bed so these are definitely a great solution I can sleep on either side I can move around at night I'm not gonna get tangled nothing's going to ache or hurt me and I think they're a really great solution for people who want to listen to audio before they go to bed but don't want to disturb the other person sleep phones can also double as a sleep mask since one of the band is significantly wider than the other if you turn it around you can use it to cover your eyes though you'll probably need to readjust the speakers overall I was really happy with my sleep phones I found the band to be really soft and comfortable it wasn't too hot at night I liked the fact that the little speakers inside are perfectly flat so they're not pressing on my head or in my ear and waking me up I like the audio quality of it I was pleasantly surprised at just how good the sleep sound it if I had any complaints about the sleep phones it's that these weren't easy to pair and it wasn't clear to me there are limitations on pairing to more than one device at a time now that I know how they work and their limitations it's easier but initially it was frustrating I also wish they had a shutoff timer to preserve their battery life overall I definitely recommend sleep phones if you're the type of person that likes to fall asleep listening to audio but you can't stand the distraction of regular headphones they sell for about ninety nine dollars on sleep phones

beats|wireless earbuds review|sony wf-1000xm3|jabra elite 75t|airpods pro|airpods 2|razer hammerhead true wireless|soundcore liberty 2 pro,2020-10-07 10:22:46.633002, ever since the launch of the original earpods a few years ago it seems that every company I know is releasing its own version of true wireless headphones to compete against Apple's air pods this year I've tested quite a bit and I narrowed them down to about the top 7 or the more intriguing options that are available and so in this video we're gonna go over those sets of true wireless headphones and see which one is worth your hard earned cash before we get started be sure to subscribe and hit the bell to get notifications whenever we share a video so keep in mind I'm taking a look at each set of these headphones from an iPhone users perspective and so I broke it all down into about four categories we have comfort Portability / battery life sound quality and then bonus features the headphones that we feature in this video are the Razer hammerheads sound Core Liberty 2 pro the Jabra elite 75 teased the Sony WF 1000 XM 3 and then Apple's trifecta of headphones that were released this year in the air pods to the power beats Pro and the newly released air pods Pro so comfort being our first category is kind of a tricky one to start off with what I want to kind of get it out of the way because for everyone this is going to be different because everybody has different ears and what you determine is comfortable might not be the same thing for me and vice versa so for me pretty much every single pair of headphones received an 8 except for the air pods Pro which got a 9 for me I think all of these stemless style headphones sort of fit the same mold and since they are pretty well lodged inside of my ears they tend to hurt more over longer durations of use compared to something like ear pods - or the Razer hammerheads which actually have a stem design and they don't really get jammed that far into your ears they are all comfortable and they all fit securely for the most part but the air pods Pro with the smaller stem have a little bit of a better fit for me and so I think that gets the higher score they do go further in your ear but they are designed in a way to help alleviate any fatigue that might result with a piece of plastic being jammed inside your ear canal and I've had just a lot less issues with comfort overall when wearing the air pods Pro so I didn't want to spend a whole lot of time on comfort just because like I said it's gonna be different for everybody but for me they were all pretty much the same - the air pods prep next up is portability and what I took into consideration with portability was not only how easy it is to transport these headphones around but battery life as well do you need to travel around with a charging cable how often do you need to charge them most of these headphones are pretty portable already and they're all trying to be a small footprint but some of them don't fit inside your pocket as well as you might think and considering that a lot of these earbuds are small you don't really want to put them in your pocket without a case and some of the cases are monstrous compared to others so for example the wonderfully named sony WF 1000x m3s have not only a gigantic name but a gigantic case that doesn't fit in the pocket as well as something like the Jabra elite 75 T's and the additional battery life coming from the charging case of the Sony's is actually worse with 24 hours as opposed to jabbers 28 so you probably guessed who scored the best in this category and that would be the Jabra elite 75 T's because they were the smallest and packed some of the better battery life inside of the case the worst Portability went to Sony WF 1000 XM threes because that case is monstrous and the sound core Liberty 2 Pro is also a pretty solid option when it comes to battery but the case for me is a little bit wonky I'm not a big fan of the slide-out top that it has and it's kind of hard to correctly get your headphones in without really focusing in on what you're doing the last two categories sound quality and bonus features are the most important so we'll spend a little bit more time on those at least in my opinion they're the most important because well we want our headphones to sound the best but we also want to have the best features that you can get with those headphones for the price I do want to preface this by saying that none of these headphones sound bad anyway they're just all really solid options and some sound better than the others so when I say it doesn't sound as good it's in comparison to the ones that we're talking about in this video so if it gets a lower score don't think that the product is trash or whatever it's just not as good in comparison to some of the others that we featured in this video so with that said the champions of this category are the earpods pro and the sony WF 1000x and threes as far as the Sony headphones go sound quality is extremely good out of the box it has some of the best balance that I've heard aside from the air pods Pro you can adjust the sound profile even more inside of the app which we'll get into and more in just a minute but with some tweaking you might be able to take these and make them sound better than any other headphones on this list but for those who want a minimal effort kind of a plug and play option the air pods Pro will rank slightly higher because I really just don't think you need to adjust the EQ at all with these headphones personally they just sound really good right out of the box on the lower end of the spectrum we have the Razer hammerhead and the sound cord Liberty to pros the hammerheads again do not sound terrible by any means but it's a little too flat for my liking well most of the headphones in this roundup tend to lean more bass heavy which can get obnoxious the hammerheads have a very neutral sound profile but sometimes that lacks in any separation of instruments or just really any punch but if you're looking for that sort of sound profile then you'll definitely be happy so for that reason it received our lowest score of 6 now the sound cord Liberty to pros might be the more frustrating option here because out of the box they actually sound pretty good but I think they can sound so much better if I could manually mess with the EQ beyond some presets that the app gives you now maybe I've missed this but I searched the app pretty well and I couldn't find anything of that sort a lot of the other headphones hovered around the 7 or 8 mark in terms of sound quality with the air pods Pro and Sony's getting the only perfect tense speaking of perfect 10 are only headphones to achieve that in our final category of bonus features are the air pods pro and that's because the only pair to have excellent active noise cancellation and transparency modes alongside the h1 chip which makes the experience way better than any other headphones on this list while there isn't a dedicated app to adjust some of the extra features that you might get the air pods Pro do not need a whole lot of adjusting for example an EQ might be nice for some people out there to further control your ear pods pro sound but it's probably not necessary for most of us who use the air pants bro as they sound nearly perfect out of the box and for me personally I don't really need or want to adjust any ANC levels but I suppose that would also be a nice to have the Sony WF 1000 XM threes offer up one of the better apps of the group and it's really easy to customize your sound and change between the extra features or customize the touch controls but those extra features aren't really anything to write home about I do think the noise cancellation is as good as ear pods Pro and I honestly cannot tell the difference between ambient sound modes whether they're on or off which is why this section is getting innate because for 229 I expected more to go along with the tremendous sound quality for the Sony's the only place the ear pods Pro suffer in is media playback controls now there are a little bit better with the new stem but you still can't control volume without asking Siri to do so and that's a little bit frustrating for me the power beats Pro got a 9 alongside the air pods too because they share the same h1 chip which is what makes the whole experience really really good when you're using Apple devices but since they lack any other additional sound quality features they won't be quite as good as the air pods Pro the hammerheads Liberty to pros in Jabra elite 75 tees of the world do not come feature-rich whatsoever but they do come at a lower price point so if you're not looking for the best of the best but want something that sounds great and it just works then maybe the Liberty to pros or the Jabra elites might be a better option for you if you're a gamer and you want razors ultra-low latency feature those might be a great option for you as well especially because they are the cheapest ones on this list and only $99 overall it's pretty obvious that in my opinion the air pods Pro are the best true Wireless options out on the market right now they sound better they fit better and have more useful features available but of course they will come at a more premium price but overall in 2019 my favorite pair would be the air Potts Pro and something that I would recommend picking up if you're looking to spend two hundred and fifty dollars so let us know in the comments section down below which headphones you prefer and why or if there's another option that you felt we might have missed and didn't include feel free to let us know in the comment section down below too this has been now MacRumors thanks so much for watching and I hope to see you around in the next [Music]

wireless headphones|true wireless|true wireless headphone|true wireless earbuds|earbuds|earbud|Bluetooth|perfect headphones|best true wireless headphones,2020-10-07 10:22:46.633025, a lot of you know that since I've been back with phone Reina I've been focusing a lot of my time and efforts into covering wireless Bluetooth headphones but not just any kind of headphones instead I have this passion for true wireless headphones of course consumers were really thrilled by this prospect but when first starts seeing the first batch of true wireless headphones we were kind of disappointed by the outcome you had things like poor battery life subpar audio performances and even connectivity issues so made people apprehensive about jumping on the trend thankfully we've seen a lot of improvements just in the last year alone but even after checking out quite a handful of different models whether they're sub $100 ones all the way to premium offerings I am still looking for the perfect pair of true wireless headphones so when I think about the perfect pair of true wallis headphones the first thing will it comes to mind is their design there are two sides here you have headphones designed for casual music listeners and then you have others or fitness junkies it's a tough balance for manufacturers I personally prefer the sporty styled ones just because you have that added benefit of being water and sweat resistant they also tend to stay in the ear a lot better mainly because they usually come with these wingtips that allow them stay in place in the year even with heavy movement I think the perfectly designed pair of true wild headphones would involve these wingtips no matter what style the manufacturer is going after take for example the Apple earpods which is great for casual music listening but terrible for exercising if they offered some sort of wingtips it would drastically improve its overall fit next up it'd be really great if all true wireless headphones offered customized equalizer settings the majority of headphones out there have just a single sound profile so you're basically at the mercy of the manufacturer some headphones I checked out offer customized equalizer settings like the j-bird run and a Sony WF 1000x I definitely appreciate the variety because not everyone's taste is gonna be the same some people prefer bass heavy tones with the lows and then some people like a wider distribution with the sound quality so obviously if they all offered customizable equalizer settings it would definitely be a benefit just because you could fine-tune the music to the way you like it pretty much all of these true wireless headphones are packaged with battery charging cases not only do they safely protect them but they actively charge them as well problem with the majority of battery charging cases right now is that they're pre generic with their functionality they basically just charge the headphones and that is it but again there are others that offer more versatility take for example the battery charging case that comes with a broken bit charge stereo not only do I love the way it's designed but it's also functional because it does feature a full sized USB port you basically gain a battery bank just because you have the ability to charge your other devices as well I actually would love to see more features tacked on to these battery charging cases take baby they could include one that has a wireless charging pad which would come in handy if you're traveling or maybe include their respective cables like for example that jlabbe epic air wireless it has a micro USB cable that wraps around the case for me I think the biggest deal-breaker with most of the true Isles headphones I've checked out thus far is the fact that they have latency issues everything about them could be fantastic they have all these cool features stellar audio quality but then when I watch a video that's when I get disappointed well it really isn't a problem when you're listening to music it's more of a problem if you're trying to use these true wireless headphones for watching videos because of these latency issues you tend to have out of sync audio with the video which is definitely annoying if you're trying to watch a movie I think about the Sony WF 1000x that I checked out not too long ago it was almost the perfect pair because it did offer equalizer settings she had these noise cancellation features and being sound amplification and much more but when it came to watching videos it had a latency issue and that just killed it for me obviously the perfect pair wouldn't have any latency issues whatsoever so everything is in sync next up I like to see more and more features included in these true wireless headphones we have things like noise cancellation which is already available in several models you also have sound amplification which is pretty handy if you're wearing two headphones and your try talk to someone when you turn it on it'll actually amplify their voice so you could converse with them those are just two luxury features that we see in some premium headphones right now but I want to see more features like the Google Translate integration with the pixel buds I think it would be really cool if there was some way to actually have those languages saved locally into the headphones so when you speak with someone a different language it automatically will do all the translation for you so you don't need your mobile device I'd also like to see more sensors integrated into these true wireless headphones not just heart rate sensors which a few already have but motion-based ones that would offer additional controls I gotta say the search for the perfect pair of true Al's headphones continues for me I checked that ones that were very close like the jaybird Ron and it's only WF 1000x but I wouldn't classify either them to be the perfect pair but I know we're getting closer because just in the last year alone we've seen dramatic improvements in a true wireless headphone segment it's even better knowing that we'll continue to see prices fall I've already checked out a couple of models that were under $100 which is amazing considering when the first generation true wireless headphones came out they were easily over $300 and that is it for this video guys what else would you like to see in the perfect pair of true wireless headphones let me know by leaving comment in this video and if you guys want to learn more about anything I talked about in this video you could check out our

Bluetooth HeadPhone Under 5000|Amazon Prime Day|Mi Basic Headphones|ony WH-C510,2020-10-07 10:22:46.633087, [Music] so in 2019 we did a video on best budget bluetooth headphones under 3000 and it's 20 20. time for iteration but this time around let's raise the bar to 5000 rupees so yeah in this video we will be covering me basic headphones bolt audio pro base akg pro k92 jbl 750 btnc sony wh c510 let's start the segment with the most popular headphones of 2019 yes the me super bass wireless headphones and two world review it's basic first thing first i'm not a big fan of on the ear headphones i usually don't recommend them to do one prime reason yes discomfort so with that out of the way these headphones offer good audio quality i mean that thumping bass that's there you will love listening to bollywood songs upbeat music or streaming netflix on it the headphones also offer good 20 hours of battery life provided that you listen at 70 to 80 volume while most of the other headphones offer only 10 hours but then of course you always have the option to plug in aux cable however it's something that people don't usually carry with themselves and you won't find headphone jack in most of the smartphones so yeah battery life really helps although if you want to see the full review i will leave the link in the description and then the youtube cards overall the audio quality is decent and the battery backup is close to 20 hours however the on-air design really gets uncomfortable after 20 minutes of using so if you're looking for a headphone for small commute this should be fine however if you're looking for a long term usage then consider the bold pro base which is available at same price hey guys a gentle reminder so we are going live on youtube today at 12 p.m afternoon to discuss the best deal on amazon your products q a and lots of surprise giveaway so yeah see you there in an hour [Music] akg pro k92 are not a bluetooth headphones but it's still my favorite headphones in the list not only because it has truly over the air design which makes it really comfortable to wear over a long period of time but the audio quality is quite clear and crisp now akg has three different headphones the k52 the k72 and k92 so in this video we have the k92 and the review might mostly hold room for other headphones as well now talking about the build quality these are the largest pair of headphones in the list and the ear cups are truly over the air i can wear it for long hours and not feel any discomfort there is also scrap that helps you to distribute the weight of the headphones on top of your head rather than on the air themselves the only caveat is the non-detachable cable this one for sure is definitely not made to be used outside the house or even when you are on the move now talking about the audio quality it's pretty good too the vocals are clear and close to actual music i can easily recommend it to most music lovers or even gamers to give you a perspective we have been using the audio technica m20x and both of them are quite similar both headphones are over the air and great for studio monitoring although do keep in mind both don't have a mic so you won't be able to make calls or use the mic while gaming sure there's a lot of noise leak in these headphones but then again for a reference headphone that's okay overall if you're a musician or a video eater and don't mind extra cables then this akg k92 pro is perfect for you next up we have the jbl 750 btnc i was quite excited to try it out two reasons active noise cancellation and over-the-air design but i was disappointed now before we come to that let's take a look at the headphones itself it looks premium and although it's made of plastic it feels sturdy on the right ear cup there are power button which works as a blue pairing button followed by volume up down and a button to enable active noise cancellation and for charging there is a micro usb pretty standard stuff however you usually don't see an extra padding in the head area in the budget once so that's nice and the ear cups are pretty soft and provide some good noise isolation now talking about the ear cups although the headphones are advertised as over the ear headphones it's not actually truly over the air i wasn't able to use it for more than half an hour i mean technically it's over the air if you compare the ear cups with other on the ear headphones like tag or sony but a true over-the-ear headphone has a larger ear cups like akg ones which perfectly fits my ear but my biggest disappointment came from active noise cancellation i mean i was able to cut the fan noise but it had no impact on the ambient noise or even the people talking i usually use the airpods pro or bros qc35 and compared to them these headphones cancel only 20 percent of the noise other than that the audio quality wasn't that impressing and the thumping bass that jbl is known for i didn't find it here and the battery is pretty average too overall two highlighted features to get this headphones is over the air design and active noise cancellation and it does none of that really well other than that the audio quality and the battery backup is quite decent but then again you can get it at cheaper headphones so in short i don't really recommend this [Music] an average headphone in this price segment offered 10 hours of battery life but sony ws c510 offers not only 20 30 but 35 hours of battery life now keeping the awesome battery life aside the first thing you notice about the sony headphone is the smaller form factor i mean here is it side by side with bold akg and me headphones and as you can see it's quite compact should be easy to put it in a travel bag also if you have a slim body type these will look better on you compared to other bulky headphones but at the same time the smaller ear cups also get uncomfortable after 15 minutes of use like i said not a big fan of on the ear headphones moving on to the right ear cups you have the generic volume up down and power button along with type c yes finally and then there is a mic for calling as well now just in case you're looking for headphones to make a voice call here's the audio sample from each headphones okay so this is the audio coming from the headphones one and as you can listen there is a lot of background noise and cross crawling in the background so this is the audio sample coming from the headphones too with the same background noise and crows crawling in the background and this is the audio sample coming from the headphone number three amidst the same environment and finally the audio coming from headphone number four obviously the same environment the same and finally the audio quality on sony well there's nothing special about the audio quality here i mean it's no reversed but there are a lot of cheaper headphones which sounds better than this to me it seems like these headphones are built for people who travel frequently i mean the battery life is awesome it takes less space in the bag and there is also type c charging so no extra cable to keep around overall if and only if you're looking for headphones with great battery backup go for sony other than that the audio quality and the build quality is just too basic for the price not recommended next up we have the bold pro base which files under the same price segment as me headphones but offers kind of over-the-air design so it doesn't get uncomfortable like the knee headphones as you can see compared to the me headphones the ear cups are slightly bigger so it will be able to engulf the air better than the me headphones the build quality is quite premium too there is this extra padding for the head area and the leather cushioning for the ear cups now talking about the range it has a range of 10 meters in fact all the headphones tws or neckbands that we have tested in the past one year has the same range which is sufficient to move around in two or three rooms without the drop of any signal it's a decent pair of comfortable headphones but in terms of audio quality its speakers are more in the boosted side which means its good for edm or poppy song however for vocals or old songs this is not recommended so finally which one should you buy well this time its more like which one not to buy and jbl 750 btnc is on top of my list it's just too expensive for the feature it offers and same is the case with sony headphones the build quality and the audio quality is just too underwhelming for the price it offer the only thing it is good at is the battery backup however if you're looking for a good reference headphone for music production or editing then consider akg headphone they are the most comfortable to wear for a long time and the audio quality is crisp and clear just just that it's a wired headphone and if i have to choose between the bolt and me headphones i prefer the bolt pro base it offers good value for money and a decent audio quality with better comfort either way do let me know which one are you gonna buy in the comment section below or if you prefer neckband or tws check out our other videos which will be dropping out soon as always it's now signing off thank you for watching [Laughter] you

After reviewing the Sony WF-1000XM3 truly wireless earphones, I can confidently recommend them to anyone looking for great sounding good looking active noise cancelling earphones under $270 or INR 20,000. 

Though there are certain things that you must know before you buy them and all that information is in the video. So do watch the full video. 

I love these earphones primarily for their design, music clarity and the bass. It's simply amazing!

are it checks all boxes in terms of design active noise cancellation features music output and clarity battery backup and even price i think it's pretty competitively priced given other products in this price segment now it was launched globally a year back and it's launched in india very recently but even in 2020 i think these are just a great pair of earphones to own and i think it's very easy to recommend them now i've got my own reason so we'll pick up a design but first it'll be great if you could drop a like hit that subscribe button and that bell icon and help me move closer to my 200 000 subscriber go anyway let's move on and talk about design first the entire unit is nfc enabled so a simple tap with your nfc enabled phone can get you connected the case is probably one of the most unique and good looking cases i've ever seen it's definitely bigger than most but again it's also better looking than most but in any regular jeans i could easily house them so they definitely take a bit more space in your pocket but i just love how it looks the soft matte finish that metallic bronze copper color satisfying magnetic grab and the case closing it just feels very polished and classy the earpieces themselves look great they have that matte finish and the same copper bronze accents that you saw in the case their size is pretty unique too you know they're not as big as let's say the bose soundsport or uh the airpods pro you know they don't hang out as much but they're also not as snug as let's say the galaxy butts plus or the galaxy buds live you've got touch controls to control music playback accept or reject calls and even fire up your voice assistant of your choice you get this whole range of ear tips and this is important for that active noise cancellation to work really well you better select the right tip for your earpiece and you have to really lock it in so that it creates enough of passive seal and anc becomes a lot more effective that way okay one downside to these they are not water resistant so you can't wear them even in light showers or a sweaty workout besides they don't really look like your usual workout earphones though you can totally wear them while you're working out okay so let's now talk about features and let's start with active noise cancellation to begin with there are two parts to noise cancellation one is passive cancellation that is you just have the earphones nicely snug into your ear with the right ear tip that it creates a seal to block half the noise without doing much and then there is active noise cancellation which is where the qn1e chip inside does its magic to block out ambient noise now they do a great job once you hit about 50 or 60 volume you can literally just zone in on the music and not be bothered with anything around you can work in total peace or even if you're commuting outdoors now i've not tested the active noise cancellation capabilities on an airborne flight for obvious reasons but given my experience on ground i can confidently say that they would do a great job blocking out noise even when you're inside an aircraft so if that's what you wanted to know there's also a headphones app that offers you more flexibility and control over your earphones now you could completely do without the app but there are some smart features built in like adaptive sound control where the app would keep track of your surroundings and movement to change noise cancellation strength and levels and even volume and there are some other tweaks that you could make within the app to better suit your earphone usage all right now let's talk about the music output the sound quality and while this is so difficult to explain because it's something you really need to feel but here's what i'll leave you with the music output it's really clean and clear and loud and with just the right amount of bass the music output is just super crisp the beats are just so sharp and pure i can totally enjoy all kinds of music on these your pieces and they're just plenty loud and then couple that with anc i don't think there's anything you can really complain about now from a call quality perspective i think they're pretty good they're definitely better than the galaxy buds plus that i've been using both in terms of clarity as well as volume one issue though the active noise cancellation it does not kick in when you're on phone calls though that would have been great and now let's talk about battery and in general i think all these earphones have great battery backup i mean i'm not that much of a heavy user so for me they go on for about a week once i've fully charged them now the guys at sony they say that the earphones can give you six hours of non-stop playback with anc turned on and then this guy over here can charge these four times over so that's 24 hours plus six 30 hours with anc turned on and if you turned off anc you could extend that to 40 hours 8 hours plus 32 hours so that's that's great i think and now let's talk about the price the more sensitive piece and these guys are right up in the alley with the both soundsport and the airpods pro so from that perspective given its features and music output i think they're very competitively priced but it's still about 270 or 20 000 rupees which is a lot of money but hey if you're looking at top quality active noise cancelling great sounding good looking truly wireless earphones i would buy them in a heartbeat and even more so above the bose or the airpods pro but that's my personal preference you have to keep in mind these are not water resistant so that may tilt your decisions in favor of something else so that's a decision i'll leave up to you but anyway that's my verdict on the sony thousand xm3 the truly wireless earphones if you've got any questions feel free to ask in the comment section below and as always guys don't forget to drop a like hit the subscribe button and that bell icon i'll see you guys in the next one [Music] you

headphones for camera|video production|post production|no cables|review|caleb pike|dslr video shooter|ear buds,2020-10-07 10:22:46.633186, hey guys Caleb here and in this video I want to get rid of these I'm so tired of cables in general and in a lot of ways we're going wireless these days we have wireless HDMI for using monitoring systems a lot of Wi-Fi 2.4 gigahertz stuff our audio is often wireless so the last thing the last piece of the puzzle if you will for me has always been the headphones but it's such a necessity for monitoring audio and in a lot of instances it really is a hindrance so it'd be amazing to have Bluetooth wireless headphones for monitoring cameras maybe just be able to quickly check audio or completely monitor wire-free so in this video we are going to grab a whole bunch of Bluetooth transmitters and we're gonna hunt down the best one for use with your camera so I went out and bought a whole bunch of different low latency systems including a pair of headphones I also have my trusty audio technica BT 50s or em 50s so I'm gonna really try to do my best to find something that'll work for us my number one concern is latency I want to make sure it's as close to what's happening in real life as possible so test number one it's going to be a very simple camera setup we're gonna have a transmitter connected to the headphone jack of this a 7-3 and then we're also going to be using a more complicated setup using the mix pre-owned and we're gonna figure out what kind of latency is working because I'd love to have an audio bag and just headphones like this that I could put on and I'm good to go for monitoring sound so let's get started and we're going to start with the cheapest option and work our way up to the more expensive stuff and our first option is this guy right here it's just a generic wireless audio transmitter so it has USB for power and then we can flip it around nothing really else going on power button and then we have an output or rather an input for our camera I'm going to using this ridiculous overkill battery here but you could obviously use something much smaller some of our future options will not need this so next we're going to be plugging this thing into VA 7-3 but first we have to pair it and for the most part pairing all these devices is very similar you simply turn on or supply power to whatever transmitter you're using then you get your headphones and go ahead and power them up and hopefully they connect to each other and there now it's connected got a solid light on the adapter so now I'm gonna take this monstrous thing and plug it into my a 7-3 and put the headphones on and hope that the latency isn't terrible so here we go check one two test one two it's pretty bad but 14 bucks so I did the initial test on the camera sounded pretty bad but now we're gonna use the recorder to figure out exactly how much latency there is and now you'll be able to hear what I'm hearing when I put these headphones on so you can see here I've got a microphone a live mic plugged into my mixer III and we're recording what these headphones are hearing so it won't sound perfect but you'll get the idea I also have a microphone just off of frame here I can actually lightly touch it here and you can hear that it's actually recording there goes a vehicle in the distance and we're going to see between the recording of the microphone and the actual recording of the headphones how much of a delay there is now you're not supposed to - and I'll put some information somewhere as to how much that latency is or how long it is so that's our cheapest option now we're going to run through all the rest now that we know the testing situation here we can just barrel through the rest of these our next option is this taotronics tiny little transmitter here I'm not going to take this and plug it into the a7 3 and as you can see a very nice little tidy setup there so I'm going to throw on the headphones we'll see if this is any better than our last one guys check one two Wow actually this is a little better I think but we'll find out on the recorder one two you test test one two check check test testing one two check check test next up we have this fox novo transmitter got it right here and this thing's a little larger so let's bring it over to the mix pre three and see what it sounds like in this is what it sounds like if you were listening to this right here right now definitely still some lingzi here's how much latency there is let's move on to the next item and our next item is the hog abyss hag abyss something like that tiny little transmitter I'm really excited and hoping this one works because it would be perfect for our use case and there ladies and gentlemen is our tiny little transmitter what's cool about this one is you can plug it in but it also is flexible so you can kind of create different angles with it which is awesome so I've got it paired up with my headphones and you can see I've got it mounted to the camera here and this is the perfect option in my opinion if there was you know low latency we've got this adorable little set up with this little dongle essentially sticking right out of the headphone jack so here goes nothing and putting the headphones on and definitely some latency so we're going to be listening to that latency right in our next option is also from the same company a Vaughn tree very similar to that Fox and Nova option we looked at earlier and this is what it would sound like if you were using this solution to monitor yourself and next up we have the Avant reprieve approve of three so we're gonna go ahead and give this guy a shot and see if it's any good now this and several of these products have something called aptX or low latency csr it's just essentially supposedly gonna help with latency and now we have the headphones hooked up with a microphone and we're gonna be listening to the audio latency right now now now you're hearing why what you're hearing I was wearing this headphones and as you can tell it's not great which is really unfortunate hopefully we're gonna find something that works at least better than this and our next item is from the same company but this one's a little different so let me get the box already here and you can see that there are actually two devices here a transmitter and a receiver so we're gonna see if this guy is gonna work better than the previous options instead of having a single transmitter like this one where the audio goes in and then Bluetooth transmits to a Bluetooth set of headphones this little silver set does something a little different one of them is a transmitter the TX it's going to take the signal from the headphone jack and transmit it to the other little device here which is the Rx this will then plug into a normal set of headphones now you can either use a corded one or use something like you know these headphones I have here in a tiny little cable you could then attach it or tape it or glue it to your headphones so it essentially is turning a normal set of headphones into bluetooth headphones but these are designed to be super low latency so let's go ahead and see if it works I'm going to take my headphones here take the receiver and plug it in this was paired out of the box so I just pulled it out of the box and turned them on I'm now going to take the transmitter which has that special aptX you know technology and I'm going to connect it to my mix pre three and now ladies and gentlemen let's see if this works going to put my headphones on the correct way and oh my gosh for the first time in this video we have low latency thank goodness I was really concerned we get to the end of these and there would be no good options and now we'll connect a microphone to his headphones so you can hear what I just heard so that should be good enough right there and here is what it sounds like when you're listening to this setup you'll hear my voice you'll hear the headphones and unlike the previous options this is so much better there's still a tiny bit of latency but for live audio I think this is amazing so so far this will be your best option let's see if there's anything else that's gonna compete and our last set up or our last solution is from the same company of Vaughn tree but this time they have a special pair of headphones that link with this transmitter same technology as a lot of the other ones so I'm hoping this one will work alright so let's talk about this setup we've got the headphones here bluetooth we've got the Bluetooth transmitter and we're gonna go ahead and power everything up so I'll turn on the headphones I'll bring in a USB battery for our transmitter because it does require USB power I know this is again overkill for something like this I grabbed an aux cable 3.5 millimeter plug it in now it's set to aux now we can pair it up in fact it's already paired it's just out of the box ready to rock and roll so we're gonna take this thing plug into the mixed-breed 3 and see what latency looks like check check check check check okay so this is great this is actually pretty doggone low when it comes to latency just a little bit there but I can totally talk and listen to myself at the same time without my brain exploding so let's go ahead and hook up a microphone to these headphones so you can hear what latency is like all right guys right now you're listening to my microphone going into the mix pre and a transmitted over to the headphones so you're listening to the set up pretty good I think the latency is still there but it's definitely not nearly as bad as some of the other solutions we looked at before so we just went over a ton of information a several different devices for wirelessly monitoring your audio so now I'm gonna kind of go through final recommendations if latency means nothing to you you do not care and you want the cheapest possible option these little Bluetooth transmitters are fine but pretty much would not recommend them because they don't have a built in battery so unless you're absolutely broke skip this guy don't recommend it the next best option in my opinion is going to be this guy right here the tower Onix transmitter has a built-in battery so you can use it without any kind of USB battery it does have some latency issues but if that's not important to you this could be a great way to go moving up a little bit in cost I love the form factor of this tiny little Bluetooth transmitter the fact that you can bend it into any shape that you prefer is awesome so if you're looking for the best on-camera headphone monitoring system for Bluetooth and latency doesn't matter to you then definitely consider this guy these two larger devices while they do work the latency was still an issue so I'm gonna say go ahead and skip those two unless you're buying something for your TV set same thing goes with this guy over here this is a Vaughn tree little round guy and then finally we have kind of the two best lowest latency options that is the Avanti little pucks here which have worked really well and I think this is a phenomenal option and you don't need Bluetooth headphones you can use whatever headphones you want as long as you can plug a 3.5 millimeter into them and then the other option which is also very low latency was this kit that included the transmitter and the headphones great great low latency option unfortunately you have to supply power to this unit so it's gonna be a little bulky for on-camera stuff but for an audio bag this could be a really nice solution now I think this setup right here involves using the headphones if you do use your own headphones you might not have the same results but for 90 bucks you get everything you need to get some decent low latency when it comes to monitoring your audio so I hope you enjoyed that comparison for me these little round things are gonna be perfect for my project that we'll be talking about here in the future so stay tuned for that on the channel we're building a really awesome audio kit so that's gonna wrap things up for me guys thank you so much for watching hope you have a great rest of your day and we'll see you in the next video [Music] you

move review,2020-10-07 10:22:46.633233, this is a super review of the job remove wireless headphones a couple months ago I was looking for a nice set of bluetooth headphones and initially I was gonna start cheap like I I love my Amazon basics wired headphones can I find the Bluetooth version of that something cheap very simple very aesthetically clean and I ended up with well not these I ended up with these and while they were cheap like the Amazon basics I liked they weren't quite exactly what I was looking for the audio quality is not quite there but I kept coming back to these just because of the aesthetic quality of it I really like the simplicity of it it looks to me like the Bluetooth version of Amazon basics headphone it's just a little bit more expensive now the good thing is that I haven't seen them for a hundred bucks in a while they've come down to about sixty bucks which seems like the standard price now 60 bucks okay I'll take a chance on a company like Jabra which I associate job of a Bluetooth but more with like bluetooth headsets for phone calls I never make a phone call I don't need to make a phone call I just need to listen to music and well we'll find out how these do that job this is a driver box very small very compact as you would expect a nice compact pair of headphones to come in let's see on the side of the box we talked about her features you know the relevant details are that you've got eight hours of battery life which is not great but it's not terrible also eight hours is you know a little bit better than you'll get from most earbuds not as good as you'll get with like those audio Technica's I have I think the battery life on those is almost 40 hours it's got a microphone don't care lightweight that's cool music yes calls don't care bluetooth 4.0 so that is actually kind of an older version of bluetooth it won't have some features like you know being able to connect to two different devices like some other Bluetooth devices have but let's go ahead and crack it open and see what's inside this box [Music] that's a cute look Wow this is very simple packaging this is just a plastic shell and not even fastened inside of it they just happened to come out is the cables we've got instructions and a warning to contact Jabra instead of Amazon who I bought this from okay we've got a USB charging cable as if I didn't have enough of these and then here is a standard audio cable which these will like a lot of other Bluetooth headphones like this these will work without any power just over a wired connection it's actually kind of an interesting thing about these Jabra is that well when you connect it with a wired connection you might expect the audio quality to be at least as good as the Bluetooth if not possibly better just because an analog signal is gonna be better than a compressed digital signal that's traveling through the air and potentially having some interference you know and that is the case with some other headphones that I have like those audio Technica's I talked about the sr5 BTS now interesting thing about these Jabra is is at least according to a very well-regarded blogger / youtuber inter fidelity is that these actually sound worse over the cable they sound better over bluetooth kind of surprising for me it's not a big deal because I don't plan on using this cable let's go back to the headset itself which is oddly wrapped in little plastic earmuffs but that's all you got between you and the headphones [Music] let's give them the sniff test let's see if these things are made of leather I can pretty much already tell you they're not yep that's synthetic it is a very compact headset the the weight of it is pretty light not super light it's not like plastically light like the the Amazon basics headphones that I have but the construction is very simple you know this head headband right here is pretty nicely padded I like that these arms right here are made of a metal you know it's probably like an aluminum or some sort of lightweight cheap metal but it's a little bit nicer than plastic and I appreciate that now one thing to note about these headphones is that according to a lot of reviews on Amazon people are having experience where the headphone padding right here was splitting apart at this seam right here you can see a lot of pictures on Amazon of people with their headphones that have split right there and that should be a reason why I wouldn't buy these headphones but from what I can tell they've actually updated the design since then and the newer versions of this have extra stitching in fact you can see the stitching a long hair on the seam that extra stitching is new it used to be just held together with an adhesive and that should hold it together much much better well so let's try it on the old noggin see how left and right nice and clearly labeled so you can see it their small size may be a little small for my big dome so notably the band does not adjust and like clean notches it's just very it's very smooth and very analog in between all of its different settings so if you are a stickler for having it being perfectly symmetrical and I don't even know why you would be like I don't know anyone who's like that except for maybe me but if you are a stickler for having it perfectly symmetrical between the two it's gonna require some eyeballing and finessing there's no like oh I need it exactly three clicks out it's a little more analog than that and then when I get to Mon my ears the sound isolation is a little bit better than I expected with a headphone like this is a very small headset comfort wise they feel pretty good you know it's it's actually kind of funny they are significantly trimmer and slimmer than my audio Technica's but on the head they don't really feel much lighter they don't feel they're definitely not heavy audio Technica's are pretty compact and lightweight as well but these don't feel any more lightweight when I wear like those amazonbasics headphones again they're just made of all plastic but they do really feel pretty comfortable and super lightweight you don't feel them on your head at all these I can tell they're there but they're not heavy that's about as much as I can say about these headphones until I listen to them so let's dive into some music [Music] all right so just did a little bit of listening with the driver moves and a couple of notes one yes they sound much better than those thirty dollar mera case bluetooth headphones the bass is all just a tad accentuated it's not super bass II but it is a little bit of a seer than some other headphones that I've listened to a couple of notes about the controls so on your left side you've got a pretty simple configuration of buttons you've got down and up buttons for volume up and down and then you've got a button in the center which controls play and pause and the the volume on the headphones is synced up with my iPhone so unlike some other headphones I'm not having to manage volume on the headphones and on the iPhone separately it's just one volume setting and it's shared between them that's great maybe one downside on the volume is that these don't get super loud they don't get the mirrored case that I have actually get a little bit louder than these these give as loud as I need them to get I don't think it's gonna be a problem but they just don't get ear bleeding lis loud and that's a good thing if you're these are you getting these for a kid and you don't want them to bleed their ears that's a good idea if you're an adult who listens to music and you don't want your ears to bleed okay yeah it's not a problem they're not gonna make your ears bleed but they don't get super loud another really good point about these the the power switch is just on or off there's no pressing and holding it to turn it on so it's very quick right it's as quick as that now it's powered on and then I timed it the time between me turning it on and it being connected to my phone was three seconds which is really fast the only other thing I can think to say about these headphones is that they don't fold up in any way you know the the ear cups don't fold flat they rotate slightly to adjust to your head but they don't rotate flat they don't fold inward for you know compact carrying but now they do they're pretty it's just a really small pair of headphones so you can leave them around your neck but if you do need something that you can fold up and pack away tight these might not do that for you if I were to score these at this point and I have to that's what this super review is all about if I had to score these at this point I might give ooh I might give these a five you know the audio quality hmm maybe not quite as high fidelity as those audio Technica's but I you know that's not exactly what I was looking for in this I wanted to sound good enough and they do sound good enough they sound great these are very comparable to the amazonbasics headphones that I have which I think punch way above their weight class they sound great I love how small and compact it is I love the form factor the build quality is very nice it's lightweight enough not super lightweight but it's maybe maybe the extra heft kind of makes it feel a little bit more premium than something like those amazonbasics headphones but without feeling any fussier it's just a simple of a pair of headphones and I like that the functionality and the buttons is everything that I want turns on and connects super quick yeah I'm gonna give these five stars and I didn't expect to give them five stars but there you go five stars for the job remove if you're looking to pick up a pair of these sometimes they listed for a hundred bucks don't pay a hundred bucks from I've seen them very very commonly for 60 bucks and I have a link to Amazon down below where you can see them probably for 60 bucks if you like the super review of the Jabra move wireless headphones you can give me a thumbs up down below and if you want to subscribe to the channel and I'll see you in the next episode

I didn't once experience any drop in connectivity in all the time that I used it and that said there is no multi device connectivity option either and that is a bit of a con here now as far as calling goes given I had a problem with that with the red knee air dots I'm happy to say that I didn't experience any such issues your xiaomi has a microphone located on the right ear cup and it works reasonably well at most times I was able to take calls with these headphones on of course they don't sound as good as headphones with dedicated noise cancellation but calls were more or less fine as long as there wasn't a lot of onion noise talking about noise cancellation this one doesn't have it but given how loud it gets you're hardly gonna hear what's happening on the outside while using these it is worth pointing out that the on your design does lead to some sound leakage and people around you can hear what you're listening to so yeah that's always there so anyway in conclusion with the me super bass wireless headphones Xiaomi has again put together another amazing value for money proposition at thousand eight hundred rupees it can be an impulse buy for a lot of potential buyers and if you do end up buying this one I'm sure you're not gonna regret it these are a good pair of wireless headphones for the price so that's my take now it's your turn to tell me what do you feel about them love em hear them you don't really care let me know and with that next time I bid you adieu please to subscribe turn on notifications by hitting that Bell icon if you haven't yet and pinch a lot for watching til next time my name's ash you've been watching sing for etek and I'm signing off for now you guys have a great day bye"

Thank You For Reading The Description :D",28,59784,165.0,514.0,39.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/87qPCUyel-s/hqdefault.jpg,skull|candy|skullcandy|skullcandy crusher|skullcandy crusher wireless|skullcandy crusher wireless review|skullcandy crusher wireless unboxing|skullcandy crusher wireless bass test|skullcandy crusher wireless headphones|skullcandy crusher wireless sound test|crusher wireless review|crusher wireless skullcandy|crusher wireless unboxing|crusher wireless bass test|crusher wireless pairing|btechtalk|skullcandy crusher review,2020-10-07 10:22:46.633307," So what's up everyone, my name is Ben and today I'll be reviewing the Skullcandy Crusher Wireless over-ear headphones. Now these are the brand new upgraded Crusher headphones, these are the second version and I have them here. So first off, these go for about $200 or 150€ here in Slovenija, but I got them with a discount for 140€, which is a pretty solid price for a pair of headphones like these, other headphones that are similar to this go for way more, but still, it's quite pricey, but you get what you pay for. So how to set them up, what you want to do is just hold down the power button, til you hear: Power On - they'll be powered on and then just go to your device, open Bluetooth and just connect to Crusher Wireless, as you can see here. It connect really really fast or if you want you can just use the 3.5mm cable. Skullcandy promises 40 hours of battery life on these and to be honest the battery life is pretty insane, it's pretty good, I have been using these for the past 2 weeks now, I've been switching between Bluetooth and the aux cable and I still haven't charged them, it still says that I have a bunch of battery life left and to be honest I'm really pleased with the amount of battery life we have here. If we compare these to let's say JayBirds, the JayBirds don't have as much, these are just really cool. The controls you pretty much have the plus button, to raise the volume and if you hold it, it will skip a track then you have the power on and off button and you have the minus button which is used to lower the volume and to go back in tracks. To be honest how they sound, on the left earcup you have a little slider and if you guys are wondering what the slider is, that is pretty much a bass control slider and let me just tell you off the bat, I have tried many different types of headphones, but these headphones are the most bass powerful headphones I have ever tried, these are so freaking loud they shake my whole head and they're insanely loud, you can't listen to these on more than 30% bass because your head will just be shaking. They're already loud if you're not using the battery if you're just using the aux cable, but if you're on batteries these go insanely loud. Your whole head will be shaking and to be honest, some of the reactions that I'm getting when I borrow these headphones to some other people are just insane. These are insanely loud and of course the sound quality is also pretty good. It's one of the best headphones I have ever used, if not the best and to be honest the conclusion is: If you're looking for a new pair of headphones and if you're willing to spend a little bit more money, I'm not saying that these are expensive, but if you're a gamer or if you're just into a lot of music with heavy bass, I couldn't recommend these headphones enough, they're the best headphones I have ever tried and are worth every freaking penny that I have paid. I'm honest, I didn't get these for review, I paid for them and these are the best headphones I have ever tried.

A big thank you to Skullcandy for sending these out for review. The Hesh 3 Headphones are the more expensive of the two, and they have some great features such as 4 hour playback time, with just a 10 minute charge.

The Riff Wireless Headphones are cheaper and lack some of the extra features you'll find with the Hesh 3's.

I hope you enjoy the video...and be sure to follow the Life of Tech social channels below.

See you in the next video!

for the purpose of this video so a big thanks to Skullcandy now both of these headsets are made of a hard plastic material the build quality is good and something I like about Skullcandy headsets are their designs and their choice of colors I've been switching between both of these headsets for about 4 weeks and that's given me time to use them for a whole range of different things and now of course I'm able to explain in this video exactly what I think about both of them they do both have easy-to-use controls on the right hand speaker and they both have a mic built in and the mic quality on both of these headsets is good I've made quite a lot of phone calls using them and a few people have commented on how clear my voice sounds so to start with the slightly more expensive Heche 3 headset comes with a small user guide a microUSB cable for charging and also a cable with a 3.5 mm jack plug at both ends which means if this headset runs out of battery power you can still use it which really is grey the Rif wireless headset comes with a micro USB cable and a small instruction guide this one doesn't have a 3.5 millet and so there are no other cables included Skullcandy say the Heche 3 headset has up to 8 22 hour battery life but I haven't quite managed to get that much out of it and for me it's been more like 18 or 19 hours but I have been using it a lot and at higher volumes - it also features rapid charging which is awesome and a 10 minute charge gives you about 4 hours of playback time which is very handy the Rif wireless headset has a much lower battery life of 12 hours and although I'm sure I didn't get a full 12 hours from each full charge it wasn't that far off the good news is though that this headset also has that rapid charge feature and a 10 minute charge will give you around 2 hours of playback time while that's not as impressive as the Hesh 3 headset I think is still very acceptable putting all of those features aside though what I'm really interested in is the sound quality and while both headsets sound very different the audio quality is very good the Hesh trees are over ear headphones and Skullcandy say they have a noise isolation fit which is true as your ears sit in the sight the padding on both sides they don't have active noise cancellation but the ear cups which are very comfortable sit perfectly around my ears and because of that they do block out a lot of background noise in my opinion they do produce a good amount of bass I wouldn't say it's incredible but I think as long as you're not looking for a seriously heavy amount of bass you would be happy with them also the mid-range is good and the highs are clean too overall I think they produce a nice clean sound and everything I've listened to I've been really happy with they're also fully adjustable to suit different sized heads and the padding for the top of your head is also reasonably thick which is great the Rif wireless headset is smaller and cheaper and the speakers sit on the outside of your ears and there isn't any padding on the band at the top but the speakers are very well padded again and with this headset the material that's touching your ears is very soft which means I actually found these slightly more comfortable to wear for a much longer period of time compared with the Heche 3 headset as the speakers sit on the outside of your ears you don't get that noise isolation and there is definitely a more open and airy feel when you're using them there's also less bass compared with the Hesh trees with that said though you do still get a very nice clean well-rounded sound which to me would be suitable for a bit of casual listening to music or even watching videos I've had both headsets connected to my PC and Mac and I've used them for things like video editing and watching YouTube as well and I've been very happy with both of them I've also had them connected to my phone and the sound quality is good there too there's little to no latency at all and I haven't heard any distortion either at higher volumes even with some tracks that are very bass heavy both headsets paired up easily with my phone and the rubber covered buttons on the right hand side of both headsets give you playback and volume controls and you can of course activate the assistant on your phone such as Siri or Google assistant they're both very flexible and they feel well built which makes me think they will last and they both offer slightly different features but they do of course both have slightly different prices there are lots of different colors and designs and if you'd like to know more about either of these headsets I'll leave a link in the description below so do go and check them out personally I'd go for the more expensive Heche 3 headset as that extra battery life is very useful the sound quality in my opinion is just simply better and I like having that 3.5 mm headphone jack - I think the Rif wireless headset is slightly expensive for what it is but with that said it is a nice headset I hope you enjoyed the video guys and as always if you did please give the video a thumbs up and let me know in the comments below what you think about these headsets and if you like tech videos like this one I cover everything from headsets mobile phones laptops and a lot more so please consider subscribing so you don't miss my next video you'll also find me on Twitter Instagram and discord and links to all of those will be in the description below I'm Roger with life of tech thank you very much for watching guys and I'll see you in the next one [Music]

technology used to be something that inspired on people something exciting and new nowadays it's pretty mundane that's what happens when an invention becomes mainstream and don't get us wrong we're not complaining wireless technologies help make our lives convenient to a degree that would otherwise be unimaginable but it's easy to forget that this is what wireless technology is all about convenience it's not a direct improvement over wires it just takes a different approach one that also has some downsides of its own with that in mind today we'll be taking a look at how wired and wireless gaming headsets measure up against each other by the end of this video we hope that you'll know exactly which type is best suited to your gaming needs so without any further ado let's begin the first thing we'd like to point out is that not all wireless headsets use the same wireless technology with modern wireless headsets you're presented with two options here they can either utilize Bluetooth or 2.4 gigahertz radio signals the benefits of Bluetooth are the lower price and the support for any Bluetooth enabled device this however comes at the cost of lower sound quality and shorter range the 2.4 gigahertz wireless is essentially the complete opposite headsets using this wireless technology have a better sound quality and a longer range but they suffer from a limited compatibility and the need to connect via their own wireless dongles in practice this means that Bluetooth headsets are a better pick if you intend to use them with multiple devices so while the sound quality will be lower by comparison we have to note that newer versions of Bluetooth offer a much better sound quality than older ones dead still worse in comparison to 2.4 gigahertz but still pretty good on the other hand if you plan on using the headset exclusively on your PC then choosing 2.4 gigahertz Wireless will give you the best sound quality just remember that whatever device you're planning to use these headsets on will need to have a USB port for the dongle and also support the headset in question now with that out of the way let's get back to the question of wired versus wireless headsets essentially there are three things to keep in mind when deciding which headset is the better pic for you these are the sound quality the price and whether you rather deal with the cable or the battery life let's start with the sound quality now before we go any deeper into this matter we have to remember that the sound quality depends on more than just the connection type the quality of the drivers plays the most crucial role here so $300 wireless headset will sound better than $100 wired one even despite the fact that pound-for-pound wired connections have the edge here another notion that we'd like to dispel is that of sound quality being measured by bit rates wired connections support much higher bit rates than wireless connections that's true but the thing is these higher bit rates are in most cases unnecessary this is because digital audio rarely reaches bit rates that aren't supported by quality wireless headsets now don't get us wrong it's not that bit rates don't matter at all if you're listening to top-quality lossless audio or analog records such as vinyl then yes you'll need the higher bit rates and therefore a wired connection but we're here to see which of these is better for gaming and frankly you have to be a certified audiophile to notice any difference here when it comes to ingame audio and mp3 files so there really is no concern not opt for a wireless headset at least as far as sound quality is concerned of course there are always other things to consider the first of which is usually the price wireless headsets may not sound discernibly worse for gaming but they sure are discernibly more expensive so the question here shifts from which one of these is better to why should I pay more for lower sound quality if you're on a budget the answer is you shouldn't especially if you're a PC gamer you'll be next to your computer anyway when gaming so the only benefit of going Wireless would be to have one fewer cable to worry about getting tangled up doesn't seem like the best rate if your console gamer however then you'll be sure to appreciate the added freedom of movement but this is already getting into the territory over third subcategory so let's roll the transition screen first okay that's better now what this section basically boils down to is both of these types of headsets have some drawbacks wired headsets can be a real hassle to manage what with the cables tangling in the limited range of movement but at least you don't have to worry about the battery getting out in the middle of a match and wireless headphones for all the freedom of movement they provide are still shackled by their battery life and ironically depend on cables for charging the battery life will depend on the model and how frequently and intensely they're being used but most headset will need to recharge every couple of days or even daily in the end it's entirely up to you to decide which of these is the lesser evil so when we look at all the equations what does the mat tell us is it better to use a wired or a wireless headset for gaming honestly neither is superior and it all comes down to preference but if we have to speak in general terms wired headsets are the better pick for PC gaming if nothing else they're much more cost efficient however if you're a console gamer or used both platforms then going Wireless is definitely the wiser move of course another good question to ask yourself is whether you need a headset in the first place if headphones will suffice if you want to know more about the distinction between these two then check out the link in the description that will lead you to our video which covers this exact topic there will also be a link to the video where we list out the best wireless gaming headsets currently on the market so make sure you check that out as well if you decide going Wireless is the way to go and there you have it a brief video answering the age-old question of Wired vs. Wireless this time in regards to gaming headsets if you've enjoyed this video then don't forget to Like subscribe and let us know where you stand on this topic down in the comments also if

feels cheaper than the case of the regular meet err dots the the hinge mechanism and the plastic just doesn't seem as nice as it is on here now we do know that they did it go ahead and give us a better chip set in these new headphones and we know that there's going to be updated controls but still I don't like that now when we get the actual headphones themselves okay this is a thick boy this is a thick thick boy we have headphone connectors in a similar style to what we have on the regular me err dots and we have a microphone here on the bottom the the kind of the plastic that these are made out of guys to be completely honest with you it feels cheaper and lower quality than it does on the originals and I know a lot of people are gonna be angry at me for saying that okay now I'm running me y11 and we are supposed to have a new animation to go along with this new pair of headphones and let's go ahead and disconnect this from my current pair available devices me err - now this is for the case guys and this is kind of strange settings I don't know if this is a shammy EU thing that we don't have but right now I cannot change anything that we have here I can't change these for a different audio codec which is a little disappointing let's see if I can do that in the developer settings Bluetooth audio codec let's see if that's saved or not nope we are back to AAC audio obviously some bugs still with these guys to be honest with you a little disappointing but let's go ahead let's put these in I'm trying to connect and use these guys but right now I'm on me why 11 beta I should I should be getting decent functionality out of these and it's totally possible that we we have you know features that are going to be coming in later versions of me UI but right now so we do have autoplay pause let's listen to some music guys I have visit almost full volume and I because there's no sound isolation I'm not that impressed let's check the latency on AAC okay the latency on these guys is actually pretty good obviously we're gonna be having a full review coming soon but this was just kind of the first kind of impressions that we had on this honestly guys I'm not super impressed with these right off the rep but overall I think that it is I think that it is a decent attempt at going after Apple earpods I need to see better integration or I need to see a companion app I need to see something that is going to convince me that these are are better in any way whatsoever than these and obviously we are going to be comparing these verses these in in the next coming days so subscribe let me know what you guys want to see in the comment section down below and until next time it's been Mitchell coming to you guys from Hanoi peace

10:22:47.004129, hi there so here are the sony xba-1 hundred bluetooth wireless headphones now when you hear the word sony the only thing that comes to your mind is excellent quality well these are premium segment budget headphones from Sony and they're currently priced at 8990 in this video we're gonna do an unboxing and have a quick overview of the device so continue watching this video this is your friend tech saying let's get started [Music] so here they are the sony xba-1 hundreds first in on the box is extra bass written in bold then you have 30 hours battery life Bluetooth wireless Bluetooth Google assistant and Alex are built in these are black color they are also available in a blue color there is extra bass written on the other side alright on the back you can see it says overwhelming deep bass and clear vocals hands-free calling with HD voice 10 minute charge plays up to 90 minutes music playback time battery life is maximum 30 hours voice assistant function compatible with Android app Ansari it has USB C that is great and a headphone cable which you can connect to listen to a source when the battery runs out and there is something called as D s EE which is digital sound enhancement engine I will be talking about this in my full review but just to give you the basics it helps you improve the audio quality and NFC is also on board so NFC is there so that means you can now pair it with any Android phone with NFC with just tapping it on the back so that's great right let's quickly unbox this Wow box packing is really impressive there you go and they look amazing just the first look and you know it's premium so it says easy setup download the app you can scan the QR code from here download the app you will get the app on the Apple App Store as well as on any Android Google Play Store power on your headphones and connected via the app inside the box there's some paperwork and some installation guide a 3.5 mm - 3.5 M cable to connect to your headphones when the battery on these totally runs out there is also a charging cable which is now a USB C to USB and then the X B 700 headphones let's have a closer look at them oh god they look absolutely gorgeous the made out of polycarbonate and they look extremely premium here on the right ear cup you can even see an NFC logo which means the NFC chip is here so you can use your Android NFC devices to just keep it here pair it and it'll start working instantaneously you have the Sony branding on the top and it's got this lovely beautiful matte finish it's engraved it looks beautiful Wow the cushions on the top are really wonderful there's Sony branding on both the sides and the cushions on the cups are too good can't wait to wear them they're like extremely soft I can imagine that when they're providing 30 hours of battery life the cushions have to be good so that you can wear it for longer so let's see the buttons so on the left here cup you have a custom button right on the top now what is custom button so this from the app you can change it to either Alexa - Google home or - Siri so you can choose either of the three from the app so when you press this it will directly enable that here's the power pairing button here's the USB C port to charge the device here's a 3.5 mm audio headphone to connect to when the juice on this totally runs out and this seems to be a mic or an LED light will no but I think this is a mic and on the other side which is the other Cup you have a plus/minus tactile buttons and the center button definitely is to play and pause the plus will also be to change the track you press and hold it changes the next track you press and hold it goes to the previous track trust me I love the build quality and it's not too heavy under 200 grams 195 grams to be exact so let's turn this on pair it with the phone and see how it performs pairing the headphones with your phone is simple standard procedure hold the power button for five seconds and it will show up in the Bluetooth settings once that is done go to the Sony headphone app and finish the setup by following the steps all right here it is WH xB 700 W it stands for wireless headphones by the way and it's at 100% here is the surround which you can change directly from your arena club outdoor stage concert hall or turn it off so you have a full surround effect available here you have clear base which you can reduce or increase so if some feel that the bass is too much you can reduce it if you want more you can increase it from here great sound position control so this is from which direction you feel the sound is coming from it will give you create that sound positioning effect so right now it's front right it's from the front it's from the front left rear left rear right and off that's actually a good option now playing so suppose you're playing songs from Apple music or streaming from YouTube or just any music streaming app or even if songs are on this it will show up here whatever Springs you can control stop next volume everything from this app directly as well some quality mode since sound quality mode you have your priority on sound quality and priority on stable connection now suppose you are in a crowded train or you're traveling to work or if you are sitting in an office where your phone is a little further away from you and you feel that a connection isn't that strong enough you can go to priority on stable connection okay D s WDS EE stands for a digital sound enhancement engine by default it's turned off you can turn it on and becomes Auto so it will help improve your sound quality alot but it will also decrease your battery life so by default it is set to OFF you can decide when you're listening to it whether you like to keep it off so that there is a little less of loss of sound quality when you turn this on change function of custom buttons so there's a custom button on the headphone which you can custom decide what you want it for you can choose it for voice assistant function like now if it's selected voice assistant function and if I press that button it will enable Siri you can choose it to launch Google assistant or Amazon Alexa you can just custom choose it from here there are not many more options apart from these three custom means just the three of these not anything apart from these so it's a nice comprehensive app you can set up things from here you can directly set things also a very important point these headphones will get software updates wire this app which is great usually when it's with our phones we go with software updates and we wait for updates right here when you get an update it will show up on the top that there is an update available wonderful that these headphones can be updated via this app this app is going to be really helpful well now it's time to wear this and see how comfortable and how's the sound quality the cushions on the headphones are extremely comfortable the headband is also well cushioned and soft these are all the ear headphones the cups are completely covering the ears creating a good seal but you can hear some ambient noises the buttons on the cups are tactile the fit and comfort of these headphones are excellent alright enough said time to listen to some music [Music] okay first thing deep is absolutely stellar the instrument separation is clear as crystal the XV 700 is perfectly tuned for the Indian audience the youth will love it there really shine when you feed it some bass absolutely brilliant value for money wow what an experience it was in my short time of using it the sound quality is absolutely ear pleasing it's lightweight they look premium yes they don't have noise cancelling but they're still so much more that is already there it's wonderful the bass is excellent if you want to buy one and leave the links in the description you should check them out they absolutely worth the price also I'll be doing an in-depth review where I'll be covering more of its features in depth more about the sound quality and battery life as and when I use it so you don't want to miss the full review video that will be coming very soon so I hope this video was helpful right on in the comments and give me our feedback about this video also if there are any other video ideas or questions about the Sony headphones I'll be happy to help don't forget to like this video share this video and subscribe to my channel for many more videos like these and of course don't forget to hit that Bell icon so that

308,VD6UX3PIz1A,Mr Baz Reviews,UCtPQuh0Lwy-n9TaLP7KKOiA,Thomson WHP3001BK Wireless Headphones - Review,"My hands on review/look at the Thomson Wireless headphones. Thomson are a brand owned by Hama

This came in quite a large box included were:
The headphones
Plastic stand/base for charging and connecting to the audio output
Power adapter
3.5mm to 6.3mm chrome plated adapter this allows you to use larger headphone sockets.
2 x AAA NiMH rechargeable batteries rated at 550mAh
A lead with a 3.5mm male plug to 2 x composite plugs (you connect this to the base and then to the sound source) length: 110cm approx.

The user guide is quite clear the phones are easy to set up, pop off the right side of the phones insert the AAA cells, plug in the charger and set the phones down in the cradle, there are 2 holes on the right side and 2 prongs on the cradle for charging. The manual recommends a 24 hour initial charge. To set up the audio attach the 2 composite leads the white/red sockets and plug in the stereo plug to the sound source (TV, stereo, MP3 player etc) On th right is a power button, the left ear pad has the auto tune button. You can change the frequency channel on the back of the charging stand via a switch to 3 positions if you need to.

**In use**

Range was good on the phones I had no problems using them in various rooms and a good distance away from the base station, the manual quotes about 20 metres inside and it's not far off of that in my testing. I didn't have any interference issues or dropping out of sound. Exact range might vary (concrete walls/floors will reduce it a bit) no complaints here. To adjust the volume use the dial on the left hand side.

Fit was good quite comfortable on the head, the top band has some padding to it and the phones are light to wear. Deep padding on the ear pads nice to see that.

The main base will light up red via an LED when it's connected to a sound source and powered on. A green LED lights up when you have the phones in the base charging (you have to power off the phones) it takes about 10 hours to fully charge them and I got about 7 hours continuous use off one charge (lowest volume levels will give slightly longer endurance) The base is a bit ""hollow/thin"" plastics wise, nothing mind blowing here it does the job no more. In most cases I found the charging worked fine but you might need to move the position of the phones to engage the pins.

**Sound quality**

At this price level the phones sound fairly good, but with an emphasis on the mid tones (speech and vocals) bass is a bit weak I expected more in this area they don't have a lot of depth or punch in the lowest frequencies though an acceptable response for the upper bass level. Treble was clear enough without being too sharp. To get a decent output make sure the volume of the source (ie TV or Hi-fi) is up higher, then adjust the headset level as required.

**Final thoughts**

For the asking price these headphones are pretty good, easy to set up and have a stable reliable connection. The sound is respectable though I feel they work better for TV listening than music. If you like a deep tight bass ""thump"" you'll be disappointed in these headphones the upper low end is quite good but they don't have huge depth in the bass it's quite laid back and relaxed. Saying that they were satisfactory for music listening, if you're not overly fussy or don't compare them to some wired phones which will do better here.",28,51944,35.0,123.0,24.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VD6UX3PIz1A/hqdefault.jpg,Thomson WHP3001BK|WHP3001BK|Thomson WHP3001BK Wireless Headphones|Wireless Headphones|Budget Wireless Cans|Hama Headphones|Radio Headphones|Battery Powered Headphones,2020-10-07 10:22:47.004152, this is a quick video review of the Thompson wireless headphones now I bought these mostly for listening to TV late at night give me a quick look over the unit on the base cradle part here we have power input and there's two combo sight plugs on here is two selector switch for the channels and on the base you have some foam pads you get an adapter for 6.3 millimeter from three-and-a-half millimeter and I have this at the minute it's plugged into mp3 player there's the cable which comes out the back so that's your sound source onto the headphones one side is marked bat at the top pull that off and you have your two rechargeable triple-a batteries that are in the box just pop them in and that's ready to charge and clip that back on controls very straightforward and you have the power button here you will see a port here where there's two metal contacts that's when you charge the headphones and there's an auto-tuned button here on this side now there's a volume control here too so to charge the phones make sure that off and then pop them in and you will see the light turn to green now I've been testing these out I'm just streaming the music now first thing to note was you need to have the source volume up a bit otherwise it will be a bit quiet for you once that's done and you have a good source the sound quality was quite good not particularly heavy on the bass but quite acceptable for the price range and the phones were quite lightweight and comfortable didn't have any problems with the range either I walked all around the house had the base unit here and it picked it up perfectly throughout the entire house so the signal is actually very good on this overall for a lightweight reasonably cost-effective set of headphones wireless these are pretty good if you're looking for something that's a bit more heavy on the base and you like a bit more thump to a sound then you might want to look at something that suits that need a bit better but overall pretty good set of headphones

comparison|jaybird sport,2020-10-07 10:22:47.004197, what's up guys I'm Jeff Rosa from residence comm and I'm back at it again with yet another jaybird x4 video today we're gonna compare them to the Bose sound sport Wireless so we've already received a few emails from people asking hey should I get Bose or should I get Jaybirds so that's what we're gonna cover in today's video we're gonna cover the major reasons you would get jaybird / pose and Bose / jaybird of course we did do individual reviews of them and I'll link those down below in the description if you enjoy the video make sure to give us a thumbs up and if you want to see more videos like this and be a part of what we got going on here make sure to subscribe that is if you're new if you're not new make sure to unsubscribe then resupplied then unsubscribe then reese absque ribe then watch this video three times share it on Facebook or Twitter let's get to it [Applause] all right so let's start with the jaybird x4 because as you will soon see they beat the living heck out of the bows sounds far wireless so the first thing is price the jaybird x4 is have an MSRP of 130 dollars whereas the bows are about 150 dollars now I'll link both in the description so you can see the current pricing or you can head on over to our website Rizzo's calm or say it with me download a completely free iOS and Android mobile app where we source some of the best deals on the Internet and we could save you guys a heck of a lot of money but anyways I brought this up because the x4 is just on paper our more affordable so if you're choosing purely based on price you're gonna go with the x-force the second thing is sound isolation so they go completely into ear canal and they see a lot off entirely which means you can focus on your workout and you don't hear a lot of the things around you now that's a little bit of a double-edged sword so I'll cover that in the bow section but if you want sound isolation you're going to get the X force number 3 they have a customizable EQ function so if you jump into the j-bird app you can adjust the entire EQ settings for the x 4's bass mids highs however you like or you can select presets based on the genre of music you're listening to now beause they have an auto EQ future now beause they have an auto EQ future holy I cannot say 8u you cute look the point is that with the J vertex fours you can customize it however you like and with Bose they have an auto feature that kind of plays with the EQ to make the sound as best as possible but I personally like the option of being able to manually adjust that EQ function within the j-bird app they also have a find my buzz feature also in there and just based on battery life to the X fours have battery life of about eight to nine hours on a single charge whereas Bose is about six hours and they are way bigger earbuds and then they have a battery life of about six hours on a single charge now the X fours also have a quick charge feature you charge them for like 10 minutes that gets you an entire hours worth of playback time I mean the wind definitely goes to the X for is on everything battery life next is the one I'm calling sport fit so the X fours are sleeker they're smaller they have more wearable methods and they come with more ear tips so not only silicon ear tips but also foam ones as well so you can wear them under ear which is kind of like the most popular way you wear them down and back around your head or you can wear them around your ears and string that cord up against the back of your neck so I think just the fit for working out the size of the earbuds all the different fit options gives a major edge to the X force I mean the bow sound sport Wireless they're so big that they were just constantly pissed me off when I do box jumps or Sprint's or go running cuz they would bounce up and down they're so heavy so the sport fit advantage definitely goes to X fours and the last thing is waterproofing the X fours are water resistant down to one meter for 30 minutes whereas the bosons bar wireless or ipx4 certified which means yeah you can run in the rain or sweat all over them but you can't submerge them I guess that's not really that big of a deal but just on paper the X fours have better waterproofing so I think most people you should get the X force like I said I'll link them in the description I think most people will find them comfortable you'll like them you'll like the audio quality you'll like the Bluetooth connection you'll like everything I talked about but there are some people that will prefer the Bose sound sport Wireless and there are at least a few advantages with those the first is kind of the flip side of the sound isolation so if you're running in an urban area and you want to be able to hear the surroundings around you you need to be able to let in some of that sound if you have too good of sound isolation you won't let in any of that sound so with the Bose because they don't completely seal off your ear canal you will get some of that ambient noise in so there's some people that will like that the second thing is and this is so disappointing I'm really grasping at straws at this point is that they charge via microUSB the jaybird X fours they use a proprietary cable and the Bose they use a micro USB cable which is easier for travel if you you know you don't have to bring a second different type of you know charge cable you just get a standard microUSB cable I know that's not that big of a deal so that's it I mean let me know what you think write me in comments do you actually think that there's a reason to get the bows over the Jaybirds I I I can't see it let me know I'll see you guys next time I've heard that [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

314,YmzyQslAkBA,TAB Reviews,UCGK5-vt34aVERJIaNjpwqog,TOZO T6 Wireless Headphones YouTube,I share my experience with the TOZO T6 wireless headphones. These are now my favorite exercise headphones!,22,51082,152.0,322.0,58.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YmzyQslAkBA/hqdefault.jpg,tozo|t6|t10|headphones|wireless headphones|true wireless|bluetooth headphones|true bluetooth|earbuds,2020-10-07 10:22:47.004295, I want to share my experience with the Tazo t6 wireless headphones start off a little background I needed headphones that I could use while exercising now at this point that had a few pairs already but all the ones that I had either didn't fit very well in my ear and they'd fall out or they just didn't have very good connections now I like to play basketball a lot with my with my headphones and so basically I have to be turning very quick and the headphones have to stay in when I do that now that being said I was nervous about getting these headphones because they're they're completely wireless there's no cord whatsoever all the other headphones I'd had in the past were not true Wireless they had that little cord that goes around your neck when I first put these these headphones in I was super nervous that they were gonna fall out every three seconds I was putting my hands up to push him back in my ear to make sure they weren't gonna fall out and it took me about 20 minutes to realize that you know these headphones weren't slipping at all out of my ears kind of began to trust them that they weren't going to fall out and at that point it's been awesome with these headphones they fit perfectly they never pull out to this today they've still never fallen out it's definitely the best 60 bucks I've ever spent I mean the alternatives being you know you could buy some Beats headphones or some earbuds but those are super super super expensive and these headphones are the fourth of the price and they they serve the same purposes that are true RLS that sound great they're great for working out also waterproof pairing super easy just throw them back in the in the case and then when you take them out at they pair automatically so let's say you want to UM pair them you just throw them back in the case let's say you have a problem with a connection for some reason maybe you only one of them paired which still hasn't happened to me but if that were to happen you just put them back in the case so they unpair and then take them out again so it just that should read pair and fix any connection problem you had now a little bit about the but the distance it has the range so I play basketball on a 75 foot basketball court and I leave my phone my backpack and I actually it never cuts out at all throughout the whole court so throw that goes 75 feet they never cut out of course if I leave the gym and I go get drink of water as soon as like the door closes or there's a wall between my phone and that year but they do start to cut out but as long as there's open space they were they were fantastic the charging case is great because it holds it holds a charge so it charges your ear buds when you put them back even when it's not connected to anything in summary just wrap it up very happy with these ear buds they work great and they're much cheaper than you know the air buds or any penny beats headphones and so I'm I'm super happy with with this purchase

I want to talk about watching TV more specifically watching TV with headphones now this is something I do quite a lot because I get quite a busy household it's quite loud and sometimes I just want to listen to the TV uninterrupted so what I've always done is used one of these yeah it's a cable but more specifically it's a cable that plugs into my evm I have an AVM which I used to watch TV movies that's how I get my sound so if I want to plug in earphones to it I need one of these it converts it into a 3.5 millimeter jack so what I would do is I would take this plug it into my headphones and then I'd plug it into my arm now if I was lucky there this flakes would be long enough for me to watch TV while I'm sitting on the couch unfortunately it wasn't so I had to buy this which is an extender cord yeah so you take this out here you'd plug the extender cord into here and then as you can see we've got lots of chords here can get a bit messy and then they plug that enter there and they were have it I can no listen to the TV my headphones unfortunately I've got all this cable and what happens is the kids come along trip over it and I can't listen to anything so what I really wanted to do was make use of these Wireless head this is what I've always wanted set in a coach no wires so when I was asked to review vests I jumped at the chance so why is it well it's a Bluetooth transmitter receiver so it converts my TV equipment which doesn't have bluetooth into bluetooth so I can use these so let's get into the video so [Music] here's the box for the Bluetooth yangu transmitter receiver nothing from really to see on the front it's just a plain box now in the back of the box it shows you the two modes and they receive Mort though that is for when you're using your tablet or your phone to effectively cast your music on to know your hi-fi equipment that doesn't normally have Bluetooth enabled the transmit mode that is where you're using your headphones which is what I'm gonna be showing in this video to basically watch TV and listen to TV using your headphones that is the transmit mode now this particular model is more available and then Yuki and Amazon but there are other models very similar to that and I'm gonna put links to that for the US market from amazon.com and weight-wise it comes at 150 grams so it's really really late ok so the technical parameters right the battery standard is a six hundred milli amp the working hours is 20 hours and it charges and roughly about three hours and the charging voltage is 5 volts and it does run off Bluetooth 5.0 so would you get in the box well you do get an instructional guide which says does come in really handy you do need that you get some micro USB that it charges with and you get all the leads that you need for audio so you've got your regular audio leads you've got 3.5 millimeter jack 2 3.5 millimeter jack and you also have got an optical cable provided now if you just have a little look at the device what we're looking at here is you've got your optical in optical out and to the left of that that's where you charge that actually put your microUSB and to the right and that's where you put your 3.5 millimeter jack as you can see it is written on the bottom when you to learn that it's the actual bottom of the device now if it just look trying to say though this is where we've got a couple of options here we've got excellent we've got a speed diff and we've also got our X and T X doesn't really mean much rate note but it will mean more to you once we get into the video that has important those little buttons there right so this is my amp and we're gonna set it up now just ignore the mess for the Xbox and all the cables right so that's what we showed you earlier I'm just plugging into the headphone socket and then I'm just putting in 3.5 millimeter to 3.5 millimeter cable one goes into the arm other goes into the device right and they will just give that a little tidy there hopefully it'll balance on top of there and you have probably one but just ignore the cables I would normally hate that behind the amp anyway right so let's have a look at the instructions to peer you say your Bluetooth enabled devices like bluetooth headphones or speakers into pairing mode right so that's fairly straightforward normally you just do a long press and one of the buttons on your headphones or it may even do it automatically it depends on your device right then you st. the b19 to TX mode okay that seems fairly straightforward then you power on then you tap the MF button twice to interfering wood with the LED indicator keep rapidly flashing blue okay that's fairly straightforward that's we've done that now now just have to set the headphones into peeling wood and these headphones is just a long press and there we go that's it in peeling would know and then we just leave them together for about 20 to 30 seconds for them to peer up right so this point where I had a little snag because it just kept blinking away for longer than the 10 between seconds then I looked instructions again and then it said something about switching between s/pdif mordar SP death mode an axillary mode and it worked as you can see it that's it so one long flash of blue means they are completely paired up so I can basically set my couch and watch the TV and peace and then may be popped into being cue and get some wallpaper finish off the decorating and if you're interested to know how to put into receiving mode so that as when you would use your tablet or your phone and it's effectively casting music on to your hi-fi or stereo equipment then you set it to rx mode instead of TX mode and then pretty much do the exact same thing the other thing that you may have to encounter is enable the Bluetooth function on your device you have to find the BT b19 to connect and then possibly having to put in the pin of zero zero zero zero right so there you go not bad little device there and it's very very simple and straightforward to connect up and you can also if you like use it for evey equipment and for example to wirelessly play music from your iPhone or your iPod or your iPad or any tablet get rid of the eyes onto you to your TV speakers personally I don't use it myself because let's face it I can use that through your other devices but the option is there always if you need it so the quality of the sound is okey it's not as good as if you use a direct feed but you'd only listen to TV so the quality is very much good enough I will see one thing though you will get better quality with the bitter hit for that you use so the better wireless headphones you've got the better the quality of the audio from your TV or whatever ears you are listening to so there we go I hope you like that and thanks very much for watching I hope you're all well and I'll see the next one so I really wanted to do is make use of these wireless headphones this why is it well it's a bluetooth receiver transceiver so what is it well it's a Bluetooth transmitter receiver hi I'm Carlton Whitfield do you worry about companies spying on you when you're online or cyber

3 or - both and then it will not produce the same amount of bass which it was producing earlier and then it will sound as if they are producing a natural sound I personally feel for me 0 - 2 or 3 is the best setting going to a negative setting usually did not produce the best sound result as compared to how it produced on 0 I'm talking about the app which you are seeing on the screen right now overall sound quality as such I am going to give it 8 out of 10 if you are a base 8 if you love bass then nine point five out of 10 from my side when it comes to our jade sings sad song or something like that they sounded pretty good as well even though those sad songs there is an internal instrument like drum or something like that that adds a little bit of bass as well so it feels a little bit busy but I am I was ok with that because the base was of very good quality if you are traveling in and I wrote lengthen there are going to be a lot of people who are going to use bluetooth headphones and if use your experience some sort of drop or something like that you can select stable connection in the app and then the app will make sure that you get the most stable connection with your WH XD 700 headphones now this headphone comes with in bit Google assistant and Amazon's Alexa notice that if you use Google assistant on this headphone you can reply to whatsapp you can reply to messages just by using your headphones these headphones come with USB type-c support thanks only for adding that and not just USB type-c fast charging Video Suite XE is possible these headphones also have a headphone jack I mean obviously but still I need to mention that 3.5 mm headphone jack to be precise if you love the wire which is provided in the box itself then you can use this and use the headphone jack which is present on the device if it is present on your device then very good good luck you've got a very good device and the normal functionality such as pausing the song cutting the call or exiting the call shifting to next song is totally possible with all these three buttons which are present on the headphones I'm not going to talk about that you do not get a carrying case in the box but the headphone can rest like this when you're traveling and walking or running around with the headphones like this is totally possible I having fast charging with this Sony headphone means like 10 minutes of charge will give you 90 hours not 90 hours 90 minutes of playback but when it comes to overall battery life frankly speaking I was not able to get the battery of these headphones to 0% even once I used the headphones for an entire week without charging this is the first time I have got through this long with any type of boobs headphones or earphones and the headphone was still at only 50% I mean it was about 10 to 15 hours of listening time more towards like 15 hours of listening time and sony claims to have 30 hours of battery life which is very close I mean you can get 27 to 28 hours of battery life basically battery life is fantastic on the headphones so who should buy the sony xba-1 in red personally if you love bass and you want bluetooth headphones then probably these are the only have that you can go with because they are very messy and they come with good connection notice that if you need great battery life in your headphone then these are the headphones to go for no doubt about that and I guess that's not it for this particular video if you enjoyed it give this to your thumbs up if you still have any more doubts and queries regarding this video do let me know about that in the comment section box below these headphones are available for about 8000 rupees when they are on sale they directly into buy these headphones will be present in the description box below as well so yeah thank you guys thank fortune

To help you stick to your new year's resolutions, we’ve compiled our recommendation list for the wireless best sports headphones based on these criteria. The headset should be very portable and easy to carry around. They should be stable, comfortable, breathable and sweat resistant enough for most exercises. They should also sound good enough so that you enjoy your workout music and should be easy to use so that you're not fidgeting with controls instead of focusing on your workouts. Lastly depending on your environment, you may want something that isolates you from the noise around you or that lets you monitor your surroundings for traffic and potential obstacles, say when running outdoors. So with that being said here are our best sports headphone recommendations that you can purchase so far in 2020 Starting with the best budget options In the best budget category, so if you want to spend less than 50$ you have the option between the Upgraded Anker Soundbuds Curve or the SoundPeats TrueFree. The 2019 upgraded soundbuds Curve is a great budget headset for sports. They’re compact in-ears, portable enough to easily carry on you or in your gym bag, and they come a good hard carrying case provided in the box. Their ear hook design makes them stable enough for most exercises, so they won't fall off your ears even when running on a treadmill or doing more demanding workout routines. They also have a an ipx7 rating for water and sweat resistance although we do not have an in-house test to confirm this. They're easy to use thanks to their simple three button set up on their inline remote and they’re decently comfortable since their in-ear tips don’t quite enter the ear canal as deeply as most in-ears designs. They also have a surprisingly great battery life of 18 hours of play time on a single charge and a decently sound that packs a lot of bass to get you pumped when you’re at the gym. Unfortunately, they do not have the best build quality. It’s decent for the price range and they should last you a while but the cable that connects the two earbuds is relatively thin and maybe the most susceptible part of their design. They also do not have any customization options and aren’t quite as compact as some of the truly wireless options. In that sense if you prefer a truly wireless design for sports but still want a budget option, then consider the Soundpeats truefree instead. They will easily fit in your pockets and they’re stable enough for most exercises. They’re also fairly comfortable despite their more traditional in-ear fit. The earbuds are dense, feel well made and sturdy for their budget price range and they deliver a satisfying sound profile that packs quite a bit of bass. Also, thanks to their more traditional in-ear fit they block more noise than the upgraded curve making them a bit more suitable for a crowded, noisy gym. Unfortunately, they do not have the best controls which means you will have to pull out your phone a few times to adjust the volume. They’re also only iPX4 splash resistant so we don’t expect them to be as sweatproof as the ankers. Their sound quality will be a bit too bass centric for some and lastly, they do not have the longest battery life at only 3.3 hours on a single charge. On the upside, you do get 4-5 additional charges in the case for a total of up to 15 hours and there is also a version with a case that has a bigger battery capacity. If you like the truly wireless format and are willing to spend a bit more, then the best options for sports you can get in this design are the; Jaybird Vista, Jabra Elite 75t and the Beats PowerBeats Pro. The Jaybird Vista are a rugged and portable sports headphone, especially thanks to their very compact charging case. They’re lightweight, breathable and comfortable to wear for long workout sessions. They are also quite stable in the ear once you get a good fit. They have a decently long battery life on a single charge at 5.5 hours and their case gives about 10 extra hours so they should last long enough for most workout routines and for your trip to and from the gym. They’re also ipX7 water resistant and have a fairly well-balanced sound out of the box that you can further customize with one of the best companion apps we’ve tested for any truly wireless earbud. The app gives you access to fully parametric EQ so you can turn up the bass to get you pumped during your gym sessions and switch to a different profile when listening casually. Unfortunately, their control scheme isn’t the best out of the box so you will have to use to app to configure the button layout so that you can have both volume and media controls on the buds. They also look a little cheap for their price range but that will be a minor issue especially if you're looking for a rugged pair of sports headphones. If you're looking for something a bit more versatile for everyday use that also works well at the gym then consider the Jabra Elite 75t instead. The 75t is the latest update to the Jabra truly wireless elite line up which offers smaller earbuds that are more comfortable to wear than the previous models of the line up. The 75t also last longer on a single charge and have up to 12 hours more of battery life in their charging case when compared the Elite and Elite active 65t. The 75t have a good control scheme that’s easy to use, a decent sound profile which you can customize via their companion app and their in-ear fit blocks enough noise to be a decent option in moderately noisy environments. The Elite Active 65t are a good alternative at a cheaper price point that blocks a bit more noise, but for most they are not as comfortable or as stable as the 75t which may be a deciding factor. Lastly if you prefer a prefer an earhook design that offers a more stable fit than the most truly wireless options on this list, then get the Powerbeats pro. The powerbeats pro do not have the customization options of the Jaybird or the Jabra. They’re also a bit more optimized for iOS users due to the H1 chip and their lightning charging cable. They are also not as Sweat or water resistant as the other models. However, they provide one of the easiest to use control schemes we’ve tested, so you will rarely have to interact your phone to skip, rewind tracks or change the volume. They also have one of the longest lasting battery life on a single charge for any truly wireless design at 11.4 hours with an additional charge in the case. This make them one of the more practical truly wireless options for all day listening and they charge fairly fast for their long playback time. The powerbeats pro also have a well-balanced sound profile with a good amount of bass, they’re comfortable to wear since their in-ear fit doesn’t quite enter the ear canal as deeply as typical in-ear designs and the earbuds are decently portable. Unfortunately, their charging case not so much. Its big, bulky and bit plasticky for their price range. They also feel a bit bland overall when compared to the other truly wireless options since they do not come with a proper app and cannot be customized to better match your listening preferences. Now depending on your workout environment, you may need a headset that lets you monitor your surroundings for potential traffic or incoming obstacles. In that sense the best option we’ve tested so far are the AfterShokz Aeropex. The Areopex are bone conducting headphones, so they won’t provide as good a listening experience for music, as more typical in-ears and over-ears. Also, since they do not block your ear canal at all, in noisy environments they will be harder to hear than most headphones. On the upside they are a great improvement over the previous AfterShokz bone conducting headphone we’ve tested, and in the right settings there is nothing quite like it for keeping your ear completely open so you can focus on your surroundings while still listening to a podcast or workout playlist. This makes them a good choice for running outdoors and they’re have a stable around the head design that’s decently comfortable. They are also lightweight, portable enough to keep on you at all times and flexible enough to fit into your pockets. They have a good iP67 rating which makes them an excellent option for running and intense workouts. They’re easy to use and provide all necessary controls at your fingertips, they also lasted about 12 hours in battery drain test which should be good enough for working out and all day listening, although unlike some of the other options on this list you will have to charge them about once a day. Unfortunately, they come with a proprietary charging cable which is not the most practical for everyday use. On the upside it does help with the ip67 resistance rating and they come with two cables in the box which is a welcomed addition. If on the other hand you work out in a crowded or noisy gym and prefer a headset that blocks or cancels a lot of noise so you can focus on your music and workout routine, then consider the Apple Airpods Pro instead. The Airpods Pro are compact, noise cancelling truly wireless headphones. Their new in-ear fit is more stable, so they are less likely to fall out of your ears than the previous airpod design. The in-ear fit also blocks a lot more noise passively which combined with their good ANC performance means you will be well isolated on your commute to the gym and once you start your workouts. The Airpods pro have an excellent build quality that feels durable and a decent sound that provides a lot more bass than the previous airpods. They also last about 5.3 hours on a single charge with 5 additional charges in the case so they should easily last you throughout the day and even have enough battery if you forget to charge them over night. Unfortunately, like other Apple headphones they do not have a dedicated app for customization options which makes them a feel a little bland overall, and they only have an IPX4 rating which means they will be less water and sweat resistant than the some of the other options on this list. If you want the best option for sports overall, then go for the jaybird Tarah Pro. They provide the best bang for your bucks for any sports headphones we’ve tested so far. They’re compact, breathable stable and easy to use. They also have a great build quality and an IPX7 rating for water and sweat resistance. They have a comfortable earbud like design that doesn’t enter the ear canal as deeply as typical in-ears while still providing enough isolation that you will barely hear what's going on around you with a little music playing. They have a decently balanced sound out of the box and like the Vista have access to the jaybird’s mysound app which gives them a wealth of customization options including a fully parametric EQ. They last about 13 hours on a single charge and will automatically turn off to conserve power which you can enable and disable within the app. Unfortunately, they come with a pretty restrictive charging cradle, so you won't be able to charge the headphones without it. If you prefer a truly wireless design, then the Vista maybe at the better alternative but for most the Tarah pro provide the best value and options for a wireless sports design. So to quickly Summarize If you need a budget wireless option for the gym then the upgraded Anker Soundbuds Curve are a great choice, or the you can opt for the Soundpeats true free if you prefer a truly wireless design. In that sense if you want a truly wireless design and have a bigger budget then you have the option between the Jaybird Vista, Jabra Elite 75t and the Powerbeats Pro. If you prefer an open design so you can be aware of what’s going on in your environment as you work out then the AfterShokz Aeropex are a good choice especially since the bone conduction tech leaves your ears wide open. And inversely if you need something to block the noise of a crowed gym then check out the noise cancelling Apple Airpods Pro. Lastly for the best bang for your bucks you can't go wrong with the Jaybird Tarah Pro. They’re a great all-around sports headphone that are only somewhat limited by their proprietary charging cradle. And that’s pretty much it... A couple of notable mentions that didn't make the cut, The Jabra Elite Active 45e. They have earbud like fit, good customization options and would be a decent option for running outdoors due to the semi open design. However, they do not keep your ears as open as the Aeropex. The Beats Studio 3 are a stable over-ear design that won't be the best for the gym since it's not very breathable and make your ears quite hot but provides a more comfortable fit than in-ears for some, especially if you're not a big fan of in-ears and ear bud design. You can also go for the Solo Pro is you like this design but prefer a smaller on-ear format And finally the JBL Endurance Peak. They’re a truly wireless earhook design that’s stable for sports and sounds decent but do not quite outperform the Beats Powerbeats Pro, they’re also a bit more difficult to use but are cheaper though which may be worth it for some. And that’s pretty much it. You can check out all our measurements and reviews for the models listed in this recommendation on our website.

one of them to you guys we'll talk about the giveaway details at a later part in the video let's see what's written on the box packing the Bluetooth v 5.0 support fast charging have a built-in microphone also support voice assistant function and come with a USB type-c port so those were some of its features now let's get started with the unboxing let me grab my knife and cut the seal on the box there you go let's open it and check out the product okay so on the inside we've got another plain cardboard box that phone's must be packed inside this thing let's check him out so here they are the new wireless headphones from Sony come packed like this in a cover and along with that we also got some packet of accessories first let me show you the headphones so this is how Sony's new W head CH 510 wireless headphones look like wow I like this deep blue color so before I give you all a closer look let me also show you all the accessories over here you get a USB type-c cable for charging the headphones and user manual that's it these are all the items you got in the box alright then let me also unbox the black color variant and show you how they look side-by-side okay guys I'm back so here are both the Sony headphones the blue one on the right and the black on the left let's have a closer look at them and talk about the design and the build quality the sony CH 510 have a simple yet beautiful looking design we've got the sony branding on both the ear cups and I have to mention they're super lightweight in the hand they only around 132 grams talking about the design the entire headphone has this textured finish all over it and the body's entirely made of plastic the CH 510 have a supra-aural style design that means they sit on top of the ears instead of covering them fully their cups are rotatable up to 90 degrees they're quite flexible and the headband is also extendable to fit almost any head size just like this talking about the cushioning the ear cups on it come with good quality cushions that feels soft and nice when you press them and I guess they're made of artificial leather that's it there is no cushioning or padding under the headband alright let me show you all the available controls and ports on the headphone we've got the media control buttons on the right side which includes a volume up multifunction button and a volume down the quality of the button see also nice and feel tactile and clicky going to the right we've got a type C port for charging a tiny bluetooth status LED indicator and a microphone that said these are all the available controls on it there is nothing on the other side let me also give you a quick look at the black color model so which one did you like guys leave your thoughts in the comment section down below alright what I'll do now is I'll just power them on pair them with my phone and talk about the comfort and the audio quality the Sony's new ch 510 a super lightweight and looked pretty good when you wear them but in terms of comfort they're not the best I've seen in this price especially the headband because there's no cushioning or padding over there it feels a bit hard after some time talking about the audio the audio quality was very good nothing less expected from Sony these headphones are close dynamic type and have 30 mm drivers in them the mid spelled crisp and clear the vocal clarity was great and I could easily understand all the dialogues it's quite a frequency response range from 20 Hertz to 20 kilohertz and I felt the treble quality was decent coming to the bass the low-frequency response was nice it was producing good and punchy bass on door rollers quite happy with the audio quality for the price the distortion of also minimum even at max volume and the audio output also loud inside is fine I've already mentioned before I did got a built-in microphone and the mic quality is decent during call conversations now let me tell you about the battery life the battery life on these headphones was excellent on an average at 70% volume level I was easily getting around 30 to 32 hours of continuous music playtime and the best part is they also support quick charging the company says a ten minute charge offers you up to 90 minutes of playtime awesome right well that was my review on Sony's new CH 510 wireless headphones they're a good quality product feels super lightweight the audio quality is nice and the battery life is also excellent the only thing I felt was the comfort section could have been slightly improved and also the price could have been a bit lower the cost around four thousand nine ninety rupees I'll just leave a link to them in the description box below and yes I know you all have been waiting for this let me tell you about

up subscribe to the channel we'll put more information about both of these products down below in the description like other comparisons and stuff that you can check out and we'll cover some of their similarities as well let's get to it ok so in terms of the areas where they're similar obviously they're both Beats products owned by Apple they have a very similar overall form factor it's a little bit different the power beats Pro are a little bit sleeker slimmer and more lightweight and they have more of an angular look to them but for the most part they have basically the same design around the earhook design that has a really secure comfortable fit they basically have the same controls it's a little bit different on how they place them on the earbuds but you get the main multi-function button and you get volume rockers on the power beats 3 it's an inline system with the power beats Pro it's actually on the earbuds but don't worry I have they actually do a really good job of placing them on the earbuds so it doesn't make them any less comfortable doesn't make it any less convenient in fact it might make it a little bit more convenient so overall similar design basically the same functions in terms of the buttons and because Apple owns beats there's really deep integration with iOS devices so the pairing process is really easy and then once you have them paired with one device that's signed in to your iCloud account all your other devices that are signed in iCloud like your MacBook or your iMac or iPad those will automatically recognize the earbuds so you can easily switch between devices that's super convenient now the power beats Pro have Apple's new h1 chip and the power beats 3 have the w1 chip there are a few things that will differ as a result of the different chip we'll talk about those but just you know they do have that special bluetooth chip from Apple and as far as like waterproof rating goes they're pretty similar right the power beats pro or ipx4 certified which is like hey you can run in the rain you can sweat like crazy you'll be fine and it's basically the same thing for the power beats 3 even though they just say it's water and sweat resistance so why get the power beats 3 over the pro given that the pro are newer they're the latest and greatest you'd think that they're better so let's talk about that first the big thing is price right the power beats pro 250 dollars you know that's on the upper end of what I can expect consumers to pay for a pair of wireless earbuds that's actually pretty expensive power beats 3 you can usually find them for about 150 120 dollars if you check out our website Rizzo's comm or you can download our ios and android mobile app we look for deals every day on beats products jaybird apple and all the other brands you actually care about and we don't sell anything we just find great deals you can check that out down below in the description I know that we find really good deals on beats products in particular so yeah as you'd expect there's a big price difference between the power beats Pro in the three and I think some people might make decisions based on that they're gonna say basically look they're gonna do the same things for me do I need true Wireless versus regular Wireless maybe it's not worth the price difference the other thing is because the power beats three have the actual cable that connects them they have that inline mic and I found that it's a little bit more clear for phone calls I really don't have any complaints with the power beats Pro they actually do a really good job but given that the microphones a little closer to your mouth if you have the the actual cable dangling in front of your face they can be perhaps maybe a little better for phone calls but that's really it you know they're kind of old so it probably comes down to I like the fit they're comfortable for me and I'm fine with using wireless versus true Wireless so why spend up for the power beats Pro obviously the the biggest thing is that they're true Wireless the second thing is that they have that h1 chip so you can activate Siri by just saying hey Siri call Matt Ross hey Siri add Pro teen bars to my shopping list so you don't actually have to press any buttons it has that standard wake word just like the new air pods and there's no lag - it works really well I could see people paying up for that convenient feature also I think they probably have the better audio quality this is tough you know because we're dealing with products from the same brands but I'd rather listen to music with the power beats Pro to mean they sound a little bit deeper richer and more full I can tell a little bit more in the mids like when I listen to country music I'd rather listen to it on the power beats Pro than the the power beats 3 the power beats 3 aren't bad I mean there's there's probably millions of people that use them and love them but I've had to split hairs I probably give the edge to the power beats Pro and then also on the battery life front so 9 hours on a single charge with the Pro Plus about 15 to 18 hours in the charge case you add that together getting over 24 hours of battery life whereas you get about 12 with the power beats 3 on a single charge yes the power beats 3 are better 9 hours 12 hours actually pretty close and then as for the fast fuel charging feature five minutes with the power beats Pro gets you one-and-a-half hours 15 minutes gets you four and a half hours with the power beats 3 a 5 minute charge gets you an hour worth of playback time so a little bit of a difference there but it actually helps health the power beats Pro so really a lot of this stuff comes down to can you afford them if you can objectively the power beats pro or the better way to go I don't think they make a whole lot of sacrifices other than the price tag right the microphone I think it's gonna be fine audio quality's good fit comfort it's all good waterproof rating they are the better set of earbuds but it really comes down to what you want in your earbuds so let me know what you think write us down below in the comments we'll obviously linked both of them in the description so you can check them out I think if you can afford them the power beats Pro are better they're the way to go but if you can't you know clearly the power beats 3 are really popular for a reason people like them they have all the other advantages like comfort and and all that stuff have a great day [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

Me and Mathias made a compact review of the new Denon AH-GC20 (AHGC20) Wireless headphones that you could say kinda competes with Beats Studio Wireless since they are pretty similar in many ways. The frequency is 5-40khz and can really be called Hi-Fi headphones which is incredible for such ""cheap"" wireless headphones! The sound is flat which is good for monitoring music and for the most clean sound.

plus review|skullcandy jib+ earphones|skullcandy wireless bluetooth earbuds|skullcandy|earbuds,2020-10-07 10:22:47.004714, this is a review for the school candy gym plus wireless earbuds so let's get started if you haven't yet make sure to give this video a thumbs up and smash that subscribe button so you don't miss out on more great content so let's unbox these of your buds and I'll show you what's inside so what you getting inside the box you get a user's guide a plastic bag of goodies with a different size ear tips large and small and on the ear tips right now they're the middle size and a microUSB and a plastic clip and you get the earbuds themselves so let's talk about the specs on these earbuds it has no plug type because there's a wireless earbuds it has an integrated microphone it has called connect and disconnect control integrated volume control and integrated functional control it has 2.4 GHz transmission frequency with Bluetooth 5.0 built-in with a range around 33 feet and finally that's called track and volume control and I did test a waterproof ability on these earbuds and they did surprisingly well with a waterproof ability they went above and beyond my expectations like I wasn't expecting these to be even waterproof like I know they gotta have this micro USB splash cover so like if it does drop in water like a few seconds it's not gonna hurt it but like you can take a shower with these on and if you drop them in the water for a few seconds there it's definitely not gonna hurt it and these are your buds have six hours of battery life ok let's get back on with the review so let's take a look at the earbuds themselves so let's start on the right ear bud it has the ARF so you can let you know it's right on the hook that helps you keep it in your ear it is detachable also if you want to take it off and also this ear tip is detachable so you can put a smaller or larger size on so let's head down to rubber cable and then we come to the counterweight of further remote it just has a school candy logo on it and some recycling information another stuff so if we go down here where the cord goes around your neck we get all the way down to the actual remote and it's a splash resistant cover on the micro USB slot with up and down volume controls and a pause button and a safe if you're like so on Spotify or something you can use this to pause and play I'm gonna leave that users guide in the description down below but the users guide you can like double tap this and go forward and then you could like triple tech tap back for like track back or something like that so if we head down here it's just a reverse of on the other side and also there's a school candy logo right there I don't know if you can see it there you go and the plastic in the remote feels kind of cheap but after a few days I kind of got used to it it would yeah it's just normal now the counterweight is a little bit heavier in my opinion than the actual remote so like if you had it in one ear the ear boat would tend to drag the counterweight down on the counterweight drag the whole thing down and it just made it really uncomfortable so everyone really recommend doing that a whole lot it's just kind of uncomfortable unless you got like the clip supporting it that I think that's what this book is for I wouldn't really recommend doing it with one a year it's just kind of uncomfortable and unconvenient so let's connect these wireless earbuds to bluetooth so when you're connecting to iOS you want to flip this up and you want to make sure that the Bluetooth symbol the symbol is blue then you want to scroll back down and then you want to go to settings and Bluetooth and then you want to go to wireless earbuds hold down on it and there will be a voice prompt saying power on and it will be flashing like this saying it hasn't been paired yet and then you just want to look for kid plus and connect the earbuds to Bluetooth and then the voice prompt will say connected so let's get on with the report of our everyday testing so during the time of our everyday testing I went out and did a lot of numerous things with these earbuds right off the bat is I got these headphones out of the box I was like hmm these are these seem good quality and don't get me wrong they are but like I said first the plastic felt kind of cheap at first but I got used to it and then I started listening to music with these earbuds for a few hours I listened to some Spotify with these earbuds for a few hours and I realized they kind of left on base a little bit but if you turn them up gradually will start getting the bass but if you're just like listening to it really low you're not gonna be able to get the bass that you're looking for well they're $15 here but so what do you really expect with the bass but other than that I didn't have any problems with these earbuds if you're looking for some wireless earbuds and you're looking for the bass but you listen to music kind of low then these earbuds they're just not really for you but if you're just looking for some Wireless you're but to get the job done like take some phone calls or listen to a little bit of music or watch YouTube videos and then go ahead these are great but overall I cute these earbuds like a seven out of ten I probably would have given it a nine it's just that the plastic feels kind of cheap sometimes and it lacks on bass I have a link below to the Amazon affiliate link to these earbuds in the description and if you buy the earbuds from my feeling it link down below it really helps support the channel and it gets me paid and I'd really appreciate it help support the channel I'm also gonna have a written review in the description down below so go check

your Bernina welcome back to the channel today I have for you my review of the Under Armour sport wireless headphones by JBL these are great headphones that have good quality audio but they also have a really good locking mechanism so that once you put them in your ear they're not coming out till you want them so thank you very much to Verizon for allowing me to check out these headphones but let's not waste any time I want to check them out I want to share with you guys what I think after using these guys for about a month now and here is the Box Under Armor sport wireless headphones made by JPL these are bluetooth headphones connecting to both Android or iOS some of the main benefits of course are the twist and lock as I mentioned to you guys this is going to be really functional for people that love having their headphones in and never wanting them to come out unless they want to durable built for resistance obviously since this is going to be sport sweat-proof be able to be against sweat when you're playing and doing all your activities JBL sounds so pure bass performance this is something that we're gonna talk a little bit more with the sound quality experience we have a microphone and inline microphone with volume up and down of course answering and hanging upon phone calls up to 8 hours of battery roughly if you're running about 50% volume a little bit less if you're running around 80 75 80 or closer to 90% and of course bluetooth wireless with great range it's supposed to also include 12 month premium membership to map my run you can download the application from either the Google Play Store or the iOS App Store looking at the contents of the box we have a lot of things in here we have a silicon kind of like a soft a silicon case that does include the microUSB to USB type a charging cable also matches the color red that we have on the actual headphones we have some instruction manuals as well as that map my run thing that I told you guys mine didn't actually have the code but that's okay I do actually use runtastic you can use any other application of course but the main benefit is that it does supposed to include a one-year membership to that and we have a few sizes for the ear cups and I'll explain to you guys what they are as well as de are tips and I think those are the small and large one but they do also come with ones pre-installed looking over at the actual tips themselves you have the ear tip right here that's removable and this is one of the ones that you can overplay they're not easily taken out but then once you do take them out it's easily replaced and again you can take them out to clean them of course and as well as the actual bigger piece here now this actually helps the configuration to be able to lock into your ear as it actually gets inserted to the actual year and then lockdown and I'll show that to you guys in a second we do have a marking here for right as well as left and they work pretty good the sound quality that we get out of here is pretty comparable to regular over the years or even you know on IRA's headphones the main thing you want to keep in mind is obviously these are not straight in they do sit on in your side your ear so they're gonna give you good quality audio but not exactly total isolation from the outside the inline remote is very nice we do have a microphone on the back we have a micro USB port that's nicely covered here for the sweat proof resistance connected here that you'll be able to charge up the device the other thing is and in just make sure when you're done okay put it back flush an LED would red and blue indicators a power on right now it's on and they have it connected to my device start and stop for music answer and hang up for calls as well as volume for our volume up and volume down and skip forward and skip back by pressing and holding for a little bit longer than just suppress so if you press and hold on the volume up skips forward pressing hold on the volume down and skips back now pairing them is pretty simple you press it turn them on for the first time if they're not pair that will ask you to pair and again double work with Android or iOS and they're independent they're basically just connect to your device and they'll connect and work with it now as far as the volume up and volume down the one cool thing I want to mention to you guys is it has its own independent volume so when I'm raising the volume up or down here you notice it's not raising it on my device so you have the ability of going to a hundred percent on your phone as well as a hundred percent on the headphones the range on this is actually pretty decent about twenty feet I've been able to go through now the reason behind that is there's gonna be obstacles so if you're working out in the in the gym and you're within about 20 feet of your bag and your phone is in your bag you're going to be pretty solid you can skip forward as far as track skip back pause and stop the music of course ants are called it's not gonna play any notifications or anything like that that's not part of the service but again overall I think it's pretty good as I mentioned to you guys the locking technology on this is extremely done well so essentially you just take the tip you put it as if you're pretty inserted into your ear and then lock down and it's solid you do the same thing down and these are not going anywhere this is actually jokingly I tried a couple of times to be asked you see how much weight can I put on it before they kind of pop out and I was actually able to put substantial amount of weight and he still didn't come out I like to put them in the front as I like to keep basically access to my remote you can of course put them in the back when you were working out I think it finds it better if you don't want it to bounce too much for you just clip the money shirt and that stops the bouncing and overall it works pretty good now as far as audio quality we're gonna go through it a little bit of different examples this is going to be a really good headphones for exercising which means you're gonna be listening to music you're gonna be enjoying them it's not going to be overly powerful that's not gonna give you that massive shower you know bass in your head like I said you found are you're bouncing in this height it's gonna be basically good the bass levels are pretty decent depending on how high your volume gets you're gonna get all these to get louder bass overall I think the mids and highs are okay as far as the performance with vocals that sounds pretty good although some of the quality and some of the details doesn't get lost but it's not as sharp that's the best way to describe it when I compare them to other headphones at least but when I'm working out honestly I'm not sitting there and I'm not looking for the detail I'm looking to have basically good music banging music whatever it is be it either electronica you know trance dance EDM all of those things or even when I'm sitting around and I just wanna listen to maybe some more vocal music in the car or even on the bus I found out they actually pretty comfortable the way they sit in your ear and that's because they actually don't sit inside the ear drum they actually sit right inside of the actual opening in your ear so it's a natural position for them so extended wear it's actually pretty good let's go ahead and start off some music and I'll give you guys some more you usually looking for a pair of headphones that are going to be really good for you and stay with you for a long amount of time these deliver the way these things were marketed is that these are workout headphones do you need them to give you good audio a long battery life as well as good controls to be able to kind of get you a volume up skip forward not having to have your phone on you all the time so the audio is going to be good enough for what you're doing because when you're working out you're not sitting there and saying oh I want the massive bass you want good enough sound good enough phase to get you through and give you that stamina that you're trying to get out of that on music that you're listening to I think the construction and the battery life and the range is really good good distance range if you don't want to have your phone on you as well as the quality of the audio and if you turn them off you're still able to listen to the sounds outside of the around you so you don't have to take out the headphones every time to talk to somebody I think that's a nice feature that people may have skipped you can answer calls hanging up and all of those things sound pretty good actually when I was using them as a as far as using them and make calls the other side had no idea I was wearing a headphone so the audio quality is really good as the microphones closer to your face let me know what you guys think in the comments below thank you very much to Verizon for allowing me to check these guys out these are definitely my favorite headphones for working out and as I like to run and I like to do a lot of different things and I don't want to have to tangle and play and readjust headphones like and subscribe as usual thank you very much for the support link in the description of course for all the information regarding these headphones and where to be able to pick them out thank you for the support as usual again I'll see you guys in the next video

338,s_zKwDC-zSw,Erin Lawrence,UCDGqNf14HSF9v8e-Qmp7VXA,Beats by Dre Solo3 Wireless Headphones Review,"Headphones are a dime a dozen these days… you can get headphones from $20 to $600 . Choosing headphones is personal, and everyone has a preference, whether it’s on-ear, over ear, in ear, noise cancelling or not… and of course sound quality comes into play big time.
Read more on these headphones at http://erinlyyc.com/2017/09/06/beats-by-dre-solo3-wireless-headphones-review/

Twitter + Instagram @ErinLYYC

I had a chance to test out my first pair of Beats by Dre headphones, these are the Solo3 Wireless.  Beats are slick looking, popular, and expensive… so are they worth the hype? Let’s find out.

The solo 3 wireless are indeed wireless, though they do come with a cable you can use if the battery runs dry. I think that’s handy, but with these, there’s a 40 hour battery life. They’ve also got fast fuel charging which will give you an additional 2 hours of power on just a 5 minute charge. Super handy if you forgot to charge them and you’ve gotta run.

Set Up.
Setting these up was instant.  You connect to them using your device’s Bluetooth menu, and they’re ready to go in seconds. The package comes with that cable I mentioned, a carry case and a charging cord. The headphones will also collapse down so they’re easier to store.

Happily, the Beats by Dre Solo3 Wireless remember which device you’ve connected to perviously and as soon as you turn them on they connect automatically.  No fussing with your Bluetooth settings every time like some other headphones I’ve reviewed.

I normally don’t like on-ear headphones. I find they hurt my ears after a while.  But surprisingly, I found these really comfortable. The padding is cushiony and the wrap is soft. The headband is padded to and they’re adjustable of course.

The Solo3 wireless have easy to find controls on the side of the ear cups that let you play/pause your music or control volume. There’s also a built in mic so you can use the phone for hands free calling.

I found the call quality excellent.  It’s very clear, no breakup and folks on the other end said they could hear me just fine when it was quiet.  When I had lots of noise in the background, it was noticeable to callers on the other end. Even when I plugged in the cable with its inline mic, background noise made a phone conversation impossible.

A handy light up battery gauge on the ear cup tells you at a glance how much power you’ve got.


 So how do they sound?  Excellent. The thick ear cups keep outside noise from bleeding in, which lets you focus on the music.

The bass is outstanding, but not bone rattling… the voice track is crisp and clear and there’s absolutely no hiss or distortion, even at high volumes. Taylor Swift’s crackly, reverb-y Ready for It was clear and fun.  Both 13 and Decades sounded rich and layered, and it was easy to pick out individual instruments. The bass was intense and thumpingly pleasant on Why We Thugs, and Sir Sly’s High. The retro-sounding Feel It Still had crisp vocals alongside deep bass, and nothing sounded muddy or muted.

Full Test Playlist:
13 - Allan Rayman
Feel It Still - Portugal, The Man
Men in Black - Will Smith
Why We Thugs - Ice Cube
Burning Bridges  - Foo Fighters
Ready For It - Taylor Swift
Decades - Matthew Good
High - Sir Sly



I can’t make any complaints about the sound, and in fact i was quite surprised at how good they sounded.  I’ve tried a lot of headphones and these have immediate shot up to one of my top 3 picks. I  would definitely buy a pair of these for myself and recommend them.

Overall I was pleasantly surprised that Beats by Dre solo 3 wireless actually live up to the hype. They’re not cheap - they sell for about $300CAD so they are an investment, but so far they seem like a good one.",28,42268,62.0,521.0,27.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s_zKwDC-zSw/hqdefault.jpg,beats|beats by dre|wireless|solo 3|headphones|on ear|best|review|erin|tech|technology|vlog|blog,2020-10-07 10:22:47.004855, headphones are a dime a dozen these days you can buy headphones that cost anywhere from 20 bucks all the way up to 600 bucks but headphones are so personal whether your choice is on ear over ear in ear noise canceling or not there's any number of features that you have to choose from these days i'm aaron from tech gadgets canada.com and today i've got my very first pair of beats by dre headphones beats are super popular they're really slick looking and yes they're definitely very expensive so are they worth the hype stick around to find out the solo 3 are indeed wireless though they do come with a cable you can use if the battery runs dry though that's possibly unlikely because these come with a 40 hour battery life there's also fast fuel charging which with about five minutes of charging will give you up to three hours of battery life perfect if you've drained the battery forgotten to charge them and you've got somewhere to be how well did the battery last I had them for a few weeks and tried them on and off for an hour or two here and there and it didn't even make a dent in the battery setting these up was instant you connect them using your device's Bluetooth menu and they're ready to go in seconds the package comes with that cable I mentioned a carry case and a charging cord the headphones will also collapse down so they're much easier to store happily the beats by dre solo three wireless headphones remember which device you've connected to previously the second you turn them on they'll reconnect to the last device so there's no fussing with your phone's bluetooth menu normally I don't really like on ear headphones I find the pressure on my ears tends to kind of get achy after a while but with these the potted ear cups are really soft and comfortable and they block out a ton of noise as well you've also got the padded headband and they're fully adjustable the solo 3 Wireless have easy to find controls on the side of the ear cups to let you hit play pause or control the volume there's also a built-in microphone so you can use the phone for hands-free calling there's also a handy light up battery gauge on the ear cup which tells you at a glance how much power you've got left for the most part I found the phone call quality on the beats solo 3 to be pretty good I could hear really well and the person on the other end of the phone that I was talking to said I sounded great and they can hear me just fine to where I did run into a snag though is with ambhi Noi's anytime there was any kind of noise happening in the background music playing people talking things like that the person on the other end complained it was really distracting so what's the sound quality like overall the beats by dre solo three Wireless sounded really good I was actually really surprised and impressed with the quality overall I think the bass obviously is really strong really noticeable but it's not that kind of jaw jarring bone crushing bass that you can get with some headphones it's just really good there was also no hiss or distortion in the high end particularly when I had it on really high volume overall I just loved how these sounded and combined with how comfortable they were to wear I have to say beats by dre has really impressed me overall I've been really impressed by how much the beats by dre solo 3 do live up to the hype they're comfortable they sound great they're compact and easy to travel with so I wouldn't hesitate to buy a pair of them for myself or to recommend them to others if you'd like a little more detail than I can give you in a short video review I've got a full written review online at tech gadgets Canada comm I hope you'll go there and check it out ask me any questions you might have as well thanks so much for watching this video if you liked it and found it helpful please do hit that like button and consider subscribing since it does help me keep making more videos that I hope you all can watch and enjoy I'm Erin find me on Twitter or Instagram until the next time at Erin lyy see

woringout,2020-10-07 10:22:47.004926, so it's been 24 hours with the brand-new air pods Pro but are they worth two hundred and forty dollars and more importantly can I finally get rid of all my other headphones such as my sony WF 1000 XM threes I don't know we're gonna find out in today's episode of iconic creators tech reviews what's up icons my name is Kim refuse founder of iconic and today I want to talk about the new Apple earpods Pro now I've been traveling for three years straight all over the world running my business and I've been trying to find the perfect headphones now my favorite before are just the Apple earpods probably the coolest thing I own closed piece of technology I own is the Apple earpods I absolutely love them I actually do not like earbuds at all they make my ears hurt they give me a headache and something about just the simple and simplicity of the plastic Apple earpods I absolutely love cells actually nervous and pretty disappointed to hear that the earpods Pro were actually multi-sized rubber ear pods or air pods if whatever you want to call ear buds ear pods the same thing just about two months ago Sony released the WUF 1000 XM 3 and I was like the marketing and the commercial they did for these ear buds was absolutely amazing I was like this is it these might be my Apple earpods replacement and Apple had not released anything about letting people know that there might be a new set of ear pods they're gonna be noise cancelling coming out very very soon so it's like hey I'm gonna give these a shot these look absolutely amazing but problem with these things is that they're probably the most uncomfortable earbuds I've ever worn and I can't workout in them because they fall out if I go to on the treadmill they fall out instantly and mission I lost the package with the replacement sized ear bud sizing which is so freakin annoying and that's why the Apple earpods are so convenient because there's no rubber things you got to carry around these I went to the manufacturer the Sony was like hey I lost him they're like whoa we got to order them and I'm like I'm not gonna be here that long to wait around for you to order them I travel full time so that was a big disappointment and now these are basically rendered useless they hurt my ears they fall out in addition when you're wearing these and the touch buttons on this are just not good now when I put these in they're like okay not too bad but it to do any sort of touching like that's how you control earbuds as you swipe on them and like my hands are little sweaty right now I just got recently got back from the gym so I'm just like okay what what am I supposed to do here bud because that's how you do it you swipe back and forth on this thing or you hold it and if you try to swipe on this thing and your hands are at all even sweaty or anything especially when I workout in these a lot it's just instantly I'm just sitting here going like okay what's up [ __ ] right like that's not fun these are very uncomfortable I was actually impressed for the first 12 hours I could say with the Sony's and then 24 hours later they basically became useless and I went right back to my always trusty most amazing piece of technology I own the original Apple earpods now for traveling I always enjoyed both of these the Bose QuietComfort QC 35 and the Sony WH 1000x increase both absolutely amazing no complaints about either of these headphones they're both [ __ ] awesome I don't prefer one over the other they're both great but I really only use these in a loud environment and/or if I'm traveling which brings me to the Apple noise canceling air pods now I was really nervous again because they're rubber and I was like I don't want to have to deal with carrying around you know other rubber things are these gonna be comfortable and it's been 24 hours since I've owned these air pods and I will say that there was two times in the last 24 hours where I had to take him out because I wasn't playing music and I just realized that they're in there and I'm like get out get out of my ears because I noticed that they were there and for something a reason about ear pods it bothers me with the original ear pods I could leave these in all day and not even realize that they were there so I will say that I had to take these out twice in the last 24 hours but overall compared to these sony earbuds these are absolutely magnificent and when I put them in the noise canceling is absolutely astonishing like I'm mind blown how well this works I would say they're almost operable to the sony wh 1000 XM threes as far as noise cancelling however they do it in addition I don't have to carry these big things around like I don't even know if I can wear these headphones with this hat on without like being weird I don't know that's not bad it's it's cozy but with the air pods I'm really happy with it I'm in Shanghai China at the moment I was riding on the subway listening to music I couldn't hear a thing or anybody talking whatsoever just totally in my zone and totally in my element so I will say within the first 24 hours I did have to take them out twice because they were bothering me a little bit while I was working overall I'm extremely happy in mind blowing with the quality and the sound cancelling of the air pod so now I want to talk about the features alright so talking about the features of the air pods Pro it's a 24-hour charging case I will say that they fit into these slots slightly better than the original air pods like originally with these I would always put the right in the left and left in the right and I would have to like go back and forth but these I don't have even have to think about it for some reason I just instinctually put them in and I believe they do you last yes four and a half hours for the actual air pods I don't know if that was that the same as their packs or more more more than the original air pods which is nice in addition they have these little air vents on each of the actual buds which allow you to turn not totally off the noise canceling but you can hear the ambient sound around you so that when you pop them in as opposed to this going fully quiet mode here you actually squeeze right or left now I'm in full just turning it on it just turned on into full audio noise cancellation it just basically you feel like you just got sucked into like a little theater dome room and you're just all sitting in your own little world then you just hold it again and then also I can hear the ambient noise and almost like I can hear myself talking through a microphone but the whatever they're doing with the noise cancellation now when I just turned this off these little air vents that are these little black slits just allowed err to transfer through and allow you to actually hear and it also gives like you a little bit less pressure on your ears like I said before earbuds if I have him in too long they always give me a headache they always make my ears hurt and it just like get out of my [ __ ] head I had to do it twice in the last 24 hours but both situations I wasn't listening to any music I like had just been working then I'll sit in the music stop while it basically there it is in noise cancellation mode or an ambient sound and I wasn't actually using them but they're still my ears and I got annoyed and had to take him out but when I was listening to music it sounds great and I didn't have to actually you know realize that this was being a nuisance in my ear so it was when they're in my ear and I wasn't actually using him that really started to annoy me some of the other features that actually has audio sharing so if you want to connect to your macbook connect your iPhone connect to your iPad you can have multiple devices if you want to watch a movie with a friend on a plane or something and actually share the audio device with the air pods which is actually cool and also within the app when you swipe down the actual little air pod button pops up here you see the little icon and then you can click and hold you can actually turn off transparency or noise cancellation mode within the app as opposed to having to actually squeeze it or you can just turn it fully off now it's fully off now it just kind of sounds weird ya know the transparency now I feel like I'm talking through a microphone noise cancellation you literally go into your own little world with these with the Sony's or the other Sony earbuds or even the Sony over ears I don't feel like I go into an underworld whatever they're doing with the Apple earpods I'm going into another little peaceful world of my own and I don't know how exactly they're doing it but it's pretty freakin amazing alright guys so I wanted to talk about the actual audio controls I'm using Spotify right now now like I said before trying to use the actual touch audio controls in the Sony WF 1000 xm3 earbuds was like impossible especially at the gym you swipe or do anything that is fly out of your ears same with even the WH 1000 XM 3 so knees like he kind of had these like weird hard swipes on it and I I just ended up not doing it so I wanted to try out the air pod Pro touch controls and I'm actually really impressed this might be the only headphones where I actually might use the touch features because it's just very simple now to pause and play the actual video all you do is just do one little squeeze now it's playing that was easy there's actually a little clicking sound that you hear inside of the headphone and then if you want to stop it boom that was easy if you want to skip the track it's just double-click it works but wait I want to go back to this truck again triple tap now I'm gonna stop it and now I'm gonna hold this to get my ambient sound back so I can hear Steve Jobs your spirit lives on bro I love you but that's basically it for the review of the air pods like what are my thoughts I think they're [ __ ] awesome I think the Sony WF X and threes suck dick I love the Sony WH XM 3 but do I want to carry these around all the time I basically only use these when I'm flying so I have yet to fly with the air pods Pro if these actually work great on a plane and I don't have to wear these big bad boys when I'm sleeping on a plane which is also annoying because if I'm sleeping on a plane and I'm like leaning my head up and I got this big thing and then of my ear pod goes or air headphones go like this and it's very uncomfortable sleep so I would love to be able to replace these on a plane but overall verdict I absolutely love the air Paz Pro Apple strikes again before these were the coolest pieces of technology that I own now Apple earpods Pro strikes again I highly recommend them anyways guys thanks for tuning in to today's iconic creators tech review of the Apple earpods Pro if you want to see my other review on my dual 49 inch widescreen LG set up its

from where uh Briz knows calm that's the best website ever and I promise you it will always be forever so as you can see with the title of the video we're gonna be doing a review of the jlabbe epic sport which are wireless workout headphones actually the ones I'm wearing right now it would be very odd Dillon if I was wearing other headphones and I was reviewing these anyway so these are 99 bucks I'll link them down below in the description so you can check them out for yourself throughout this entire video we're also going to be comparing them to the j-bird X 3s and that beats power beats 3 we're gonna kind of see how they stack up in certain areas so if you find the video helpful and make sure to give us a thumbs up and then subscribe if you're into this stuff we do tons of videos about tech and workout equipment and so if you're into that stuff this is the right channel for you let's get to it [Music] okay so you've probably seen jlabbe products around the epic twos were actually really popular I've seen some other websites that said they're the best wireless workout headphones so the epics poor are basically just an improvement in a few areas over the epic - so the first area is they're now more water resistant so they used to be ip55 certified now they're ip66 certified and basically what that means is you can sweat all over them you can take them out like right now it's raining outside you can take them out for a rainy day run but one thing is you should not swim with them and don't get in a habit of submerging the headphones and by the way bluetooth doesn't transmit underwater anyway so just don't use them for swimming the other thing they did is they now have bluetooth 4.2 as opposed to a Bluetooth 4.0 so the connection is going to be better but it's not really that impressive for Bluetooth range and stability I'd say it's pretty much on par with the jaybird X 3s and a lot of other headphones out there walls doors people like the pain train they can kind of mess up that signal sometimes and even with the clear line-of-sight you can expect like 30 to 50 feet before you get some sort of signal interference I would say the beats power beats 3 are probably the best in class for a Bluetooth range and stability they just kind of beat the pants off everyone else it's much better with the epic sports than it was with the epic twos but it's not quite up to the beats standards it's about on par with the jaybird X threes the last thing they did is they added three different EQ settings so you can have basically different sounds signatures depending on your preferences so they have one that's called balanced which should be renamed flat because it's shallow raspy lacks depth if you listen to it you'll be able to know that it is the balanced one and you probably won't use it and they also have signature which is the jlabbe signature audio settings and that's the one that I would use it sounds the best of all three it has pretty good mids and highs generally it's very clear and as a little bit of bass but you know not that much bass and then they also have bass boost which as you'd expect has a lot more bass but it actually doesn't sound that good I don't think that you'll probably want to use that one it is nice now though that you have all of these different EQ settings but I think most people are just gonna end up using signature over all the audio qualities headphones are good but not great I think good enough for most gym goers though now in terms of changing you know your audio preferences or your sound signature or whatever you want to call it the EQ settings I actually prefer the way jaybird does it they use an app and you can control pretty much everything and create your own specific sound signature within that app of course that means you have to use an app with the jlabbe epic sports you actually just click the volume up and the volume down button at the same time and then you'll cycle through all three so it's kind of like whichever one you like better I also like the fact that within the jaybird app you have that find my buds feature if you lose your headphones which I've done plenty of times now in terms of the fit this is a really subjective point it's like I like some headphones you may not like the headphones in general I think the jlabbe sports are really comfortable and they have a pretty secure fit and they do come with five different sets of GL ear tips and then three different sets of GL ear fins so you should be able to find a combination that best fits your ears I was disappointed though because they didn't come with the comply of foam tips because those are the ones that I prefer to use I think you get better sound isolation because they expand and fill up your ear canal and they just are really really comfortable but it's still really nice that you have five different sets of ear tips and a bunch of ear fins to boots now on top of that I never really felt like these headphones would fall off my head like I work out pretty hard and I work out quite regularly and even when I was running this monstrous hill that my girlfriend made me run I never felt like there were gonna fall off my head and I'm not gonna lie I definitely walked when Amelia wasn't looking when I was supposed to be running the hill now I do like how they wrap around your ear that's how I use some of my other headphones that's kind of the way the power beats 3 to it for me I couldn't get the best fit with my ears I just couldn't get that great sound isolation like I similar to the powerbeats three that's kind of how I feel about those as well but there's a lot of people that just say I'm completely crazy and the fit is perfect so it's like on it like on a year-by-year basis so you know you kind of got a triumph for yourself the flip side of that though is since I couldn't get a great seal I could hear the ambient noise around me which some runners may like especially in like urban areas because it can be like a safety feature of being able to hear everything around you now the epic sports they're also going to come with in addition to that your tips and your fins will come with a cable slider and a cable clip so if you want to clip it to your shirt so it doesn't move around or if you want to like adjust the length of the cord you can do that as well it's really standard with workout headphones I don't love having like the extra cable around my neck to me it kind of just don't knows me having this flop around on my neck that's why with the X 3s I really like that you have the option to string it up along your head so it's really snug against your head you don't have to worry about this extra cable but again it's it's really standard the epic sports also come with a full inline remote and microphone you probably expected that essentially volume buttons pause play answer phone calls skip tracks all that stuff pretty standard nothing really special the buttons aren't especially tactile or clicky but the I do like that the remote is rather light so it doesn't weigh on the the cable and it doesn't kind of flail around and get in your way I had that issue with the j-bird freedoms and the freedom twos because they have a larger remote so you don't really have that issue with the epic sports but possibly the best thing about the jlabbe epic sports is the battery life so jlabbe says they're gonna get around twelve hours on a single charge we had them go ten we had them go 11 we had them go 14 it all depends on the volume but it's gonna be right around 12 hours I think on average for people at like you know 60 70 percent volume right in and around that range battery life is really good the thing I didn't like about the whole charging and battery thing was that they require a proprietary charger which kind of sucks cuz that's just another cable that I need to remember to bring with me and I always forget that cable but again that's standard with headphones to kind of have that the X 3s have proprietary charger I just don't love it and then they also don't have to my knowledge a quick charge feature like you'll see on the beats X or the power beats 3 it's not really a I guess a game changer but that would be nice to have as well so overall I do like the Jayla but epic sports they're not my favorite headphones ever I think they're pretty good for most people out there I'd say for me they're about on par with the beats power beats 3 in terms of comfort and fit and audio quality I do think the jaybird x3 still sound the best I think they have the best-in-class audio and those are some pretty fantastic headphones but when you look at battery life beats and jlabbe kind of win they're right around 12 hours maybe a little bit more for beats but jaybird is definitely in third place right around eight to nine hours on a single charge now which one would I go with because I'm hoping that you care about my opinion I'm actually just gonna stick with the jaybird x-rays and this is all taking to account price the x3 is 130 bucks I find them all the time for like $100 or under I'll link them in the description or if you're looking for deals on headphones and stuff definitely check out our website or you can download our free mobile app it just hit 60,000 downloads we don't sell stuff like when we find deals we don't we're not actually selling it will just post about them every day and we post the top 100 deals of the day jlabbe beats jaybird they pop up all the time and we can definitely save you money on them so I'd say price point is actually kind of similar so the X threes are still my honest-to-goodness favorite headphones that I use every single day I'd say like I said before the J lab epic sports for me are kind of on par with the power beats 3 there's lots to like about them but they just don't fit my ears great now Amelia my buddy Harry Dan they all say that these fit their ears better so it's something that you gotta try out for yourself I think Beats probably has a little bit better build quality and I do like that they have that quick charge feature but again you're gonna pay up for that and these guys are right around 99 bucks and you'll probably seem discounted in the future yada yada yada that's it for the video I would love to hear which one you would go with like which headphones would you pick out of the three and why you would do that write me down below in the comments I'll see you guys next time have a great day [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

This is your boy El Jefe. And I'm here to talk to you guys about some headphones that are highly requested by a lot of my viewers. So I recently did a review of the Tao Tronics BH060. I kinda wasn't feeling those headphones, they kinda had some quirks that I really didn't like. So, you know, but I still reviewed them and you know you guys did like that review but in the comment section of that video I got some requests for a brand new one from them called the BH046. I hadn't heard of those. Reached out to Tao Tronics, they sent them over, so now we're making the video. So just to be clear for full disclosure before we go any further Tao Tronics did send out these headphones free of charge for the purposes of this review. Now if this is your first time here, you're not familiar with the way that I do things. Whether the company sends out the product or if I go out and buy it myself I'm always gonna keep it 100% real with you guys. And let you know whether or not it's worth your hard earned money. So with that said let's get right into it. Alright so just some quick details about the Tao Tronics BH046, so you can find these on Amazon right now for 99.99. I'll leave a link to that in the description box down below. But there's also a 20 dollar off coupon. So all you gotta do is click that little box that's right under the price and they'll be 80 bucks for you. So, not bad. Now just to be clear that is an Amazon affiliate link. So if you guys buy those products I do get a small percentage of that sale at no additional cost to you. I just wanted to make that clear and get that outta the way. Now these headphones are featuring bluetooth 5.0, they've got 30 hours of playback time. But more on that in the review. They also have a rapid charge feature, pretty dope. We'll talk about that in a sec. 40 mm drivers and they also include a really nice case, the aux cable, micro USB charging cable and that airline adaptor thing that they include with a lot of different headphones. Never used one but they do include it so it's a nice touch. So now that's outta the way let's talk about some of things that I don't like and we'll get into the things that I do like. So first, and it's gonna seem a little bit nit-picky is the fact that they're still using micro USB for charging. 2019, I mean they even have them in the description as a 2019 headphone yet we're still using micro USB. And I know there's a ton of people out there, ton of products, ton of phones that still run micro USB but still, 2019 I was hoping that we'd be kind of moving forward, start putting more products, you know, using type C as a standard. But maybe that'll happen next year, I don't know. But that's sort of a little gripe for me. I like to not have to carry a micro USB cable, if I have the option. But it is what it is. Secondly, the battery life. So the battery life was a little bit weird. So they're talking about 30 hours worth of playback time. Fresh out of the box I was able to pull 14 hours at 80% volume with the ANC turned on. Now that's just fresh out of the box. That's without, you know taking them out and givin' 'em a full charge. So I'm a assuming they had maybe a half charge, something like that. So giving the benefit of the doubt, went ahead and recharged them and fully charged I managed to pull 21 hours out of these with the ANC turned on and at 80% volume. ANC turned off I got closer to 24 hours. Still not bad but definitely not the 30 hours that they are claiming. Now I'm sure if you know I turned the volume all they way down or something maybe I could squeeze out more battery life out of them, I don't know. But the 30 hours, not really it. So that being said those are things that I kinda don't like about 'em. But let's get into the things I do like. And we'll start off in the same area, in the same topic, the battery life. So they do feature a rapid re-charge feature. This I do like. So what that means is if they're totally dead you can charge them for five minutes and it'll give you two hours worth of playback time. That's legit. And if you wanna fully recharge 'em from dead only takes 45 minutes, that's pretty sweet. That's something that I wanna start seeing in more headphones movin' in. You know to 2019 and 2020 that rapid recharge feature, that's clutch. If your headphones happen to die out on you and you could just, you know, charge 'em up in under and hour, that's what's up. That's a major plus for me. And then you've got the connectivity. So bluetooth 5.0, no lag, no latency when watching videos. You know, both on my iphone 10s the galaxy S8 plus and OnePlus 6T, no lag whatsoever with the only exception is being, the Youtube app. With the only exception being the Youtube app for IOS. For whatever reason with that app on IOS I still get some video lag despite which headphones I use, it still happens. But beyond that, I mean any other app for both android and IOS, no lag or latency whatsoever. And then there's no connection issues. I don't have it dropping out, I don't have, you know, where it's stuttering or disconnecting or anything like that. Pairing is super quick and easy. You know you turn 'em on, they automatically get into auto pairing mode. And you know if you're one of those people that leave your bluetooth on, on your phone, you know, it'll basically auto pair as soon as you power 'em up. So as long as it's a trusted and remembered device it will auto pair to your device. I think that's pretty dope. And then as far as range goes, you know, I managed to get right around 30-35 feet. You know, walk around the backyard, walk around my apartment, at work. The only time I started having any kind of stuttering or any kind of lag or delay is when I start pushing, you know, putting walls between my device and the headphones, you start having some issues then. But that's to be expected. And then next up we have the call quality. So these do feature that CVC 6.0 which is clear voice capture, you know, using the mics to get, you know, higher call quality. As far as the calls comin' in it sounds really really good. I can hear people they can hear me. But I did record a sound clip for you guys, I'll let you guys hear that now. Alright so I'm just calling you to do a quick sound test on the microphones built into the Tao Tronic's headphones, how do I sound? - [Male] You sound alright man. I can hear you. - [El Jefe] Alright cool man. Just wanna make sure I'm coming through clear. - [Male] Yep. - [El Jefe] Alright thanks man. - [Male] No problem. - So what do you guys think of that call quality? Is it something you could work with? Let me know down in the comment section. Next up let's talk about the comfort and easily one of my favorite things about these headphones. So these have to be one of the most comfortable headphones that I've tried in a long time. So they are very generously padded as far as the head band goes and on the ear cushions. And I mean this is like leading comfort, like you know I have the bald head so I get, you know I'm sensitive to them not having enough padding on the headband. These not an issue whatsoever. I can wear these for extended periods of time and without ant fatigue, either on my ears or on the head. So that's a major win for these. Not only that ,they're also very light weight which really caught me by surprise but they don't feel cheap they have a good build quality to 'em. But you know nice and light weight, combine that with all the extra padding on the ear cushions and the headband and like I said these are easily some of the best and most comfortable headphones that I've worn in a good long time. So if comfort is key, which it is to me, which it should be to you, these are a definite win in that department. And then last but not least let's talk about the sound quality and the active noise canceling. So first let's talk about the volume. These, plenty of volume. Now anything above 90 gets a bit to loud for me. You shouldn't be listening to your headphones at max volume anyway to be completely honest. Because all you're doing is damaging your hearing. So when I see people doing that stuff and listening to them at max, max volume and stuff, man that's just not good for you man. You know I wanna be able to hear stuff, I wanna be able to enjoy my music until my old age. So I'm not gonna be listening to the stuff at max volume. So to me anything above 90% on these, it just gets way to loud. So normally for me comfortable anywhere from like 65-70 to about 80-85 is perfect for me. So as far as the volume goes you know, whether you're watching like a video that has some speech or some you know, people are talking and it's very low, you've got some good head room so you can turn it up and you can hear 'em. So there's plenty of volume it'll have you covered for whatever you need. And then as far as the sound quality. So to me these seem like they're more of a I would say maybe like a V shaped sound. So you got really good bass, you got some nice highs, mid range a little bit reduced. So if you're gonna be listening to hip-hop or trap or EDM, things like that, these are really gonna shine. But it's not limited to that. So I tested these with a ton of different genres, you know classical, reggae, latin music, rock, hip-hop, EDM, trap stuff like that. So I tested it with all types of genres. If you're interested in the playlist that I use, I'll leave a link to my Spotify playlist in the video description if you wanna check that out. But across all genres everything sounded really really good. Trebles nice and clear, bass is nice and deep and nothing is overpowering, nothing is over blown. And the only time that it gets slightly, slightly muddy is in the mid range but it's really not bad especially considering the price that you're paying for these. And then active noise canceling. So your active noise canceling on these does not hurt the sound quality. That's a major win Tao Tronics. Considering that was a major gripe I hade with the BH060s. On the BH046, not an issue. Now the noise canceling itself so it works very well. It eliminates a ton of low frequency noise. So you know I'm not talking about speech, I'm not talking about kids crying or high pitched noises and things like that, it's not for that, it's for low end noise. So like engine noise or like if you have equipment in your office or wherever you might be or even if you're gonna take a flight and you wanna knock down some of that engine roaring, this is where these shine. Knocking it down that low frequency sound, very good for that sorta thing. So as far noise canceling goes I would pit these against something like the soundforce space MCs, you know something like that or soundcore live two's, as far as you know budget noise cancellation goes. So would I recommend you guys go out and pick up the Tao Tronics BH046, absolutely. Especially right now that you can get 'em for 20 dollars off at 80 bucks. These are a great deal. Sound quality, ANC and that comfort, dude, take it from your boy El Jefe the Tao Tronics BH046 are legit. It's a good total package headphone for under a 100 bucks. I'm really glad, I'm really happy to see the Tao Tronics really stepped up with these and not only in the styling, which I do like the way that they're styled but comfort, sound, everything, just the complete package. It's a win. So for your boy El Jefe, man I highly recommend these. But let me know what you guys think. Do you guys see yourselves picking up a set of these. let me know down in the comment section. Do you guys have a recommendation on a different headphone something similar to this, maybe under a 100 bucks, let me know. You guys know I love hearing your suggestions. And if you guys like this video go ahead and smash that like button and if you guys didn't like this video go ahead and hit the dislike button.

The first thing you'll need to decide is what form-factor you prefer. Do you want over-ear headphones, on-ear headphones, or in-ear headphones? Before we get started with our video detailing the best wireless headphones on the market, we have included links in the description for each product mentioned, so make sure you check those out to see which one is in your budget range. Starting off with the best overall wireless headphones we have the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0. Which Bluetooth headphones should you get if you want the best of the best? In our testing, the best wireless headphones money can buy are the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 Wireless over-ear headphones. There are a number of things that make these headphones so good. For starters, they look beautiful. The headphones are built with premium leather, along with a strong metal frame and a rustic look. It's a great combination, but the build doesn't just make them good-looking — it also makes them nice and strong. While the headphones do have an over-ear design, they are somewhat portable. They fold up and fit into a nice strong case, which is included in your purchase. The case is great for those of you who want to take your cans on the go. The Sennheiser headphones are comfortable, too. They have nice memory foam in the ear-cups, and while we would have liked to see a little more foam in the headband, that's not a deal-breaker by any means. Then there's the sound, which is the highlight of these headphones. The Sennheiser Wireless over-ear headphones boast a deep, rich low-end, along with a well-tuned and accurate mid-range and crisp high-end. They also have noise cancellation, and while it's a little annoying that you can't deactivate it if you want, it well help keep that extra noise out so you can listen to your music in peace. We're not the only ones who love the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 Wireless headphones. They scored 9/10 in a review from Headphone Review, and their predecessor, the Momentum Wireless 2.0 headphones scored 9/10 on Trusted Review and 4/5 on CNET. The main downside to these headphones is that they're not cheap. To get them, you'll need to shell out a cool $350 to $500, but if you do, you won't be sorry. Next up we have the best noise-canceling wireless headphones which go to the Bose QuietComfort 35. Bose is a powerhouse in the headphone world and has been especially successful when it comes to noise cancelling headphones. In our testing, the headphones with the best noise cancellation technology are the Bose QuietComfort 35 headphones. When these cans are on, the noise cancellation is almost eerie. The headphones aren't just great for noise cancellation. They're extremely comfortable and sound great, too. Sure, the design isn't all that interesting, but for many people that doesn't matter as much as the noise cancellation technology and sound quality. If you're into customizing your cans to suit your personality, you can design your own headphone on Bose's website. The Bose QuietComfort 35 headphones also come with everything you'll need to take them on planes and around town, including a nice carry case, plane adapter, and an aux cable for when you want to use them in wired mode. Speaking of which, wired mode is, unfortunately, the only time you can use these headphones without noise cancellation on. There's no switch to turn it off when they're connected through Bluetooth. Plenty of reviewers loved the headphones besides us. Trusted Reviews gave them 9/10, CNET gave them 4.5/5, and Headphone Review gave them 9/10. They are a little pricey, coming in at $299 to $350, but paying that will get you the best noise canceling headphones around. Up next we have the best on-ear wireless headphones which go to the AKG N60 NC. Looking for something a little more portable than the over-ear Sennheiser Wireless headphones? The AKG N60 NC Wireless headphones could be the ones for you. The headphones feature a super sleek design with a black and silver color scheme, along with an on-ear form factor, which makes them a lot more portable than over-ear headphones. They're made even more portable with their swiveling earcups, which help the headphones fit nice and snugly in the included carry bag. The AKG N60 NC headphones are comfortable, too. There's a good amount of memory foam in both the earcups and the headband. The best thing about these headphones, however, is that they sound great. There's a ton of low-end frequencies, though the bass doesn't go overboard. The high frequencies are nice and clear, too, which helps the music sound crisp. Next up is the fact that these headphones also feature noise cancellation that's better than you'll find on many other headphones. It's not quite as good as the Bose QuietComfort 35's tech, but it's good nonetheless. The headphones aren't perfect. In the pair we tested, there was a small amount of Bluetooth noise, which came in the form of a very faint buzzing in the background. You couldn't hear it while music was playing, but it was a little annoying. Others liked the N60 NC Wireless headphones, too. They scored 8.7/10 on Headphone Review. The Verge also liked them during their preview, PCMag gave them 4 out of 5 stars, and Time also praised them. The headphones are a little pricey at $150 but more affordable than our top pick. Next we have the best wireless headphones for less than $150 which goes to the JBL E55BT. Looking to buy a great pair of Bluetooth headphones on a budget? Just because you don't have a ton of cash, doesn't mean you can't get some great headphones. In our testing, the JBL E55BT headphones are the best headphones under $150. For starters, unlike plenty of other headphones, these come with a very fun design. You can get them in a ton of colors, including red, black, blue, green, and white. They also fold up, so they're somewhat portable and can be taken on the go. The headphones don't just look good, they sound good, too. They could use a little more in the high-mids frequency range, but apart from that, they offer plenty of bass and a crisp, concise high-end, which makes for some great-sounding music. They're on the better end of the spectrum with battery life, too. A single charge will get you 20 hours of listening time. The headphones have reviews like the 4/5 rating on PCMag and 8.1/10 on Headphone Review. And, as mentioned, the JBL E55BT headphones are relatively cheap with an original price of $149.95. At the time of the video, they were on sale for $109.95 on Amazon. Next we have the best wireless headphones for great sound which goes to the Master &amp; Dynamic's MW50. The best Bluetooth headphones need to sound great, feel nice, and look good — especially since they'll command a high price. Thankfully, Master &amp; Dynamic delivered with the MW50. From the first time you put them on, you'll appreciate their feel and things will only improve when you actually start listening to music. Because music has to get compressed when sent wirelessly from your phone to your Bluetooth headphones, you end up losing the little details that make songs special. No Bluetooth headphones (at least not right now) will give you every nuance you'll hear with a high-end pair of wired ones, but the MW50's performance is excellent. I was able to pick up on sonic subtleties that would get lost or sound muddy on lesser pairs, and that was true regardless of what I was listening to. Music encoded at a lower bitrate would sound worse, but that was more a matter of the MW50's exposing flaws in the files rather than making them sound that way. There is a new version of this pair or headphones, which has newer Bluetooth connectivity standards, but you'll pay a bit more for them at $399 as opposed to $295.99. Second from last we have the best wireless headphones for less than $50 which goes to the iFrogz's Impulse Duo. These iFrogz headphones made the best earbuds guide, so I'm just going to echo what I said there below: Besides sounding pretty good for the price, the reason iFrogz Impulse Duo earbuds made the cut over all the other budget models I've tried is their design. The dual driver construction is what gives these earbuds an audio-edge over the competition. But mostly, these earbuds succeed where most Bluetooth models fail: Instead of having all of their technology built into an unwieldy dongle that hangs off the cable connecting both buds, iFrogz built it all into a magnetic clip. Clip the dongle onto your clothes, pop in the earbuds, and you're ready to listen to music. In terms of audio quality, you shouldn't expect a truly audiophile experience for less than $50, but don't expect a bad one, either. These are actually the upgraded version of the earbuds iFrogz released last year, and while the design is the same, time was spent in improving the sound quality. I'll put it to you this way. These headphones are so easy to use and sound good enough, that they're my go-to pair between reviews. It's just so convenient to coil them up and pop them in my pocket after a commute, or once my friends finally make it to our meeting place. Now for our last pick we have the best wireless headphones for travelers we have the Sony WH1000XM3. Noise canceling is becoming a common feature for many Bluetooth headphones, and for good reason. It's nice to block out the rest of the world during your morning commute or to block out the screaming kid in front of you on the plane. Sony's headphones have the best noise cancellation of any headphones — Bluetooth or otherwise — that I've ever tested. On a plane ride from New York to San Francisco, the only thing I heard was the music I put on. Without any music, the noise canceling feature was able to block out a lot of ambient noise, which should also appeal to you if you're looking to sleep en route to your destination. This pair of headphones also has a few ""smart"" features, thanks to touch controls on the right ear cup. Placing your hand on the ear cup activates the microphone, letting you hear noise (like a pilot's announcement) while lowering your music. As someone who put this feature to the test while traveling, it was surprisingly useful. Noise-canceling aside, these headphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time and sound very good overall. The audio quality wasn't as high as some other pairs I've heard, but noise canceling actually does color the sound a little bit. Still, it's a fair trade-off for such a nice feature. So that sums up our top wireless headphones of 2019. We hope you enjoyed. If you did please leave a like on the video and if you’re new here hit that subscribe button. Until next time have a great day."

headsets so this is a set of Bluetooth earphones that we're going to be unboxing for tech travel geeks if you haven't already please do subscribe to the tech travel geeks on youtube you'll be notified of every time we unbox new products when we review one when we have an episode of the podcast and any other sample video we upload so let's have a look at the holy hi be e 1018 the packaging is very simple it's a black cardboard box no cellophane was included in this when it arrived from amazon gives you some basic specifications its bluetooth five there's between 10 and 20 meter range it takes an input of one ampere that's because they charge via their case and it takes an hour and a half to charge the case and about four and a half hours playback from the buds so let's open the packaging and here you have the holy high case which is quite large but we'll see why in a moment I'm going to take a plastic cover off here so you see the Holy High logo there it's quite improvidence a simple lip to open it up micro USB charging port at the side and details on the back of the model number of charging power and the FCC certification and the fact that it's made in China let's open up the lid I'm struggling to open all that let's try again yep this is not opening ok maybe I'm doing something wrong let's have a look at instructions so in here we have micro USB cable some earbuds and these have holders within them so the earbuds with means of security in your earlobes when during sport and another set of earlobe holders and things so these are quite handy if you prefer different colors or accessorizing with your running gear as you do sports with your Bluetooth headset but let's look at the details themselves so it says push here to open that's where we were probably going wrong so we need to push there nope I'm struggling here let me try it off camera yep and definitely struggling with this I will pause the video first I go and see if the instructions can illuminate me on how to open this packaging just a moment okay then I have successfully opened that it took quite a lot of pushing on the bottom so this case closes very very securely and is quite a large one as far as bluetooth headphone let's go so the earphones themselves are simple pair of buns and you can see there's the Pogo connectors on the underside to them the ear plug style noise isolating silicon buds that actually wedge into here and these over earlobe hooks that will keep them stable last year for example running or doing sport so this is obviously a sport products I will now synchronize these with my Google pixel 3xl let's make that happen so to turn them on you need to long press the button on the side and then you'll have flashing but I believe you'll need to search on the Bluetooth on my device so there's a Xiaomi phone I definitely know which one that is and my me been three and Candice's me ban three and a smart band I believe ID or is a tws let's see it's a bit of a guess here let's try tws and I hear the tws earbuds l which I'm assuming are the holy high earbuds are connected I'm now going to go into my Google Play Music app and put the earbuds in and see what the sounds is like what shall we test with this my usual test music which is Jennifer page there we go go with some classics right I will try these out and then provide you with some first impressions once I'm finished okay then I'm back I've tried the holy hi-ee 10:18 waterproof buds with a variety of songs and podcasts and audiobooks and I have to say the sound is quite good they have a decent amount of bass they reproduce sound pretty well in my opinion and they fit quite nicely in my ear I like the fact that this medium to small buds fits nicely and and then you have the extra reassurance of this hook that goes around your earlobe and the stereo worked well I had no issues with that and as you saw the setup with my Google pixel 3 XL was very very simple so I'm very happy with that the one thing I'd say is obviously the first time I opened these probably because they're new it was quite tough it took me a while to do it the second time but then from there on I love that you need your fingernail underneath here and push and then lift so it's a push and lift not just a lift which is good if you're carrying them around in a bag or if you were to drop them you're less likely to have this challenge in opening them but as I said the fact that they have a leaflet in here means that we're not the first people to have had an issue opening them and I'm having the same issue again anyway um thanks to holy high for providing us with this review device we will be doing a full review on the tech travel geeks website soon once I can open the packaging the casing and we will be linking to Amazon in the description to this video you will also get a 15% discount cards discount voucher which we will put in the description that's provided by holy high who provided us with this review unit which were struggling to open the case to yes I think this this case issue is a bit of a problem the fact that they have a leaflet in it to describe the issue is interesting it seems to be that you need to push the very top of the lid in for the crook to open which is good but anyway apart from that as you can see the moment I open the case they reconnected to my phone and started playing music apart from that these are a very good pair of headphones for the price which is around about 40 pounds sterling under 40 pound sterling and I will be putting them through their paces before doing a full review thanks for watching a room I need to practice I need to practice opening the case yep I definitely do if you enjoyed this video and my failures at opening and closing the Bluetooth case to these holy high earphones please do subscribe to the Tetra geeks on YouTube you will get notified of all our latest videos whether they're unboxings failures at opening packaging or casing reviews and podcasts so thanks for watching around goodbye

Mi Super Bass Wireless Headphones Review Bluetooth",28,34466,187.0,711.0,269.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dL8NNNHa8zU/hqdefault.jpg,mi super bass wireless headphones|mi super bass wireless headphones review|mi headphones review|xiaomi super bass wireless headphones|super bass|wireless headphones under 2000|superbass|super bass headphones|mi bluetooth headphones,2020-10-07 10:22:47.364867," Whenever someone asks me to suggest a wireless headphone below the 2000 Rs. price point, I just tell them to either stick to wired gear, or increase their budget to 3000 Rs. Because making a decent enough headphone, in my opinion, is almost impossible at this price point. Because even decent enough earpads alone cost around 2000 Rs. Hey guys, I am Siddharth,and if I’d give a benefit of doubt to any company, it would be Xiaomi, because they really set new benchmarks for value in all segments they make products in. So let’s find out if their new Super Bass Wireless Headphone is good enough or not. So the headphone has a well thought out design, they really have tried to make the most of what they could use at this price point. In spite of being made with not so premium plastic, it feels solid, and there’s no cheap feeling creaking noises. The earpads are pretty decent for the price, the earcups do have some adjustment, and the headband cushion also works well. The earpads are actually removable, which I wasn’t expecting at this price point. The buttons are well placed and are easy to reach, and you can play, pause, and change tracks, and receive call with these. You also have a 3.5mm in port for using it in wired mode, along with a micro USB port for charging, and you do get cables for them in the box.. The comfort on these is also pretty decent for on ear headphones, these are light and the ear pads are soft, so you can wear these for about an hour comfortably. But since these are on ears, they are going to hurt your ears after some time, and if you wear glasses like me, its going to be difficult to wear them for more than an hour. One downside in my opinion is that these ear pads are going to need replacement soon, and I don’t know if the ear pads for these are going to be available for purchase separately. Xiaomi claims 20 hour of battery life with these headphones, and in my tests they easily lasted that duration, which is really great. This is how the microphone sounds, it doesn’t sound very good, and the voice sounds muffled, and I don’t think this is going to perform well in a noisy environment. But for the price, I don’t think that I can complain. Coming to the sound quality, this is an area where I was expecting a compromise. A wireless headphone has to have the frame, the earpads, a bluetooth receiver chip, DAC, Amp, and a battery, in addition to the sound driver. So while the sound quality of these headphones is actually good for the price considering what I talked about, there are unfortunately some limitations with the quality of sound driver you can have, even for Xiaomi. Before I go further, I do want to say that I really think that these are the best sounding headphones under 2000 rs., I had tried a boat headphone at a similar price point, and they were so bad that I decided to not make a video on it. But these are great given the limitations we have here. The problem is that, sometimes good is just not good enough. So the mid-bass of these headphones is boosted, and I guess that’s why it has ‘Super Bass’ in its name. But the bass extension doesn’t go low, so the bass is pretty mediocre. The mids are passable for me, but they do get kind of muffled with the super bass of these headphones. The highs are pretty bad, there’s no clarity, and the instrument separation is also bad so everything kind of mixes into each other. Nowt I understand that these are not meant to be audiophile headphones, but the reason I am criticising the sound so much is that you can get MUCH better sound quality by spending 500 or a 1000 Rs. more. The Blitzwolf true wireless earphones that I reviewed sound a lot better while offering true wireless advantage, and if you are looking for better battery life, the loop audio earphones are a really great option, they have one of the best sound signatures in the segment, and the microphone is also much better. And yes, I know that these are earphones and not headphones, but you have to ask yourself, why are you interested in buying a headphone in the first place, (especially when you’re on a budget)? It’s because you want better sound quality and comfort, and you are not going to get either of that with these headphones, in spite of how good they are for the price. So in conclusion, if you really want a headphone instead of an earphone, and you really can’t spend more than a 500-1000 Rs., then yes. These are probably the best option. They do check all the boxes of a good headphone for their price. But I think it’s better to save up and get something that’s actually usable, instead of wasting your money on an underwhelming product, and I have said great things about audio gear that costs 800 Rs. so I am not being an audio elitist who thinks anything that costs below 10,000 Rs. sucks. I’ll have my links in the video description if you have decided to buy these, along with recommendations for the other devices that I mentioned, with their reviews, so make sure you check all of that out. But before I end this, I have to say that Xiaomi has done something really impressive with making a headphone that’s as good as this, but they can’t change the laws of economics or sell headphones at a loss, and that’s why these headphones in particular do not get my recommendation.

So what I've got here is the Skullcandy Riff Wireless. So I picked these up in the crimson and white. They're also available in a couple of different colors, but I'll leave links to all of these in the description box down below. Now normally they retail for right around 50 bucks. I actually picked these up when they were on sale for 30. So if you're interested in 'em, keep an eye out for those discounts. Now, before we go any further and for a full disclosure, I went ahead and bought these headphones myself with my own money for the purposes of this review. And if you're new here and you're not sure about the way that I do things, whether a company sends me the product or whether I go out and buy it myself, I'm always gonna keep it 100% real with you guys and let you know whether or not it's worth your hard earned money. So that's it, let's get into it. Now, I came across the Skullcandy Riff Wireless headphones on Skullcandy's website, so I was kinda on the website kinda tooling around around Christmas time, trying to find some good deals on the Hesh 3 Supras or maybe the Crusher 360s, trying to see if there was any good prices to be had. So, a lot of the stuff was either sold out, the Crushers didn't get a huge huge discount, and much as I thought they would, so I was kind of passing on them. And as I was searching through the pages, I found the Riff Wireless, and I thought: 'hey, they look kinda cool'. Saw the price tag, 30 bucks, couldn't beat that. I was like: 'you know what, let me go ahead and try them out, see what people think'. People like budget headphones, I've got a lot of people that watch my videos that like budget products, so I figured let's bring 'em in and check 'em out. So, that out of the way, let's talk about 'em. So first up, let me talk to you about some of the things that I do like about these headphones and then we'll get into the things that I don't like. So first up, let's say sound quality. Now, the sound quality is exactly what I expected out of some Skullcandy headphones. You've got some decent bass, you got good mids, and the treble is okay. These are nothing to write home about, these aren't gonna blow you away, especially being that they are on-ear headphones, they're not over-ear, so as far as that goes they're very good. I would consider these more like an entry-level type of headphone than anything else. But the sound quality is there. Good bass, good mids, and some decent highs. Like I said, nothing too crazy, but not bad. The Bluetooth pairing was quick and easy, also didn't experience any video latency when I was watching videos and stuff like that on my devices, so that's also a plus. Not only that, the cushions on the ears themselves, on the actual drivers: nice and generous, well padded, they sit on top of your ears, like I said they are on-ear headphones, they sit on your ears nicely, don't cause a ton of ear fatigue, and so that's kind of a plus, but there are some things with comfort that I'm gonna get into in just a sec. They're also very lightweight, so you're not gonna have any fatigue from them weighing you down, they're very lightweight. And they also have built in controls so you can do your volume, your track forward, track back, play/pause, things like that, that's built in right to the ear cups so it's convenient and it works. And then one of the other features that I do like is they do have that quick charge feature, so you can charge 'em for 10 minutes and it'll give you 2 hours worth of playback time. That's kind of a cool touch, I like that that. But that will lead me right into some of the things that I don't like. So first up, the playback time. So overall, even though they do have that quick charge feature, the overall playback time on these is 12 hours. Now, if we're talking 30 dollar headphone, I could forgive it, but the fact that these fully retail at 50, and most of the competitors that are in the 50 dollar range are pushing anywhere between 18 to 30 hours, or sometimes more of playback time, then 12 hours kind of ain't cutting it. I mean, it's nice having that rapid charge feature, but come on man, you know, 12 hours? So in my testing I managed to squeeze right about 11 hours and 10 minutes, that's listening to them at around 70 to 80% volume. So which is not bad, but still, you know what I mean? 12 hours, and you know maybe the smaller batteries might have to do with something with them being lightweight, maybe it's weight savings, okay, so be it. But that brings me to another point. They're super light, but it's because it's a completely plastic build. And with that, for me they sort of feel a bit on the, I don't know, on the cheap side I guess you could say? The plastic is nice, everything looks good and professional, it's Skullcandy, but I don't know. I've got some other headphones like some of the TaoTronics, even some of the Mpows, and those are in the same price bracket, 40 to 50 bucks, and those things are built like a freakin' tank. They've got the heavy-duty plastic with the aluminum on the inside and a bunch of padding. That leads me to the other thing, there's no padding on the headband, it's just a straight plastic. Sitting on this head, dude (laughs). After about an hour I started really feeling it, left a nice line over my head, so if you're a baldy, you may wanna stay away from these. Unless you're gonna wrap that headband with something, I don't know, but even just a little strip of material, I mean anything, Skullcandy, come on man. Any little bit, don't just leave bare plastic up there man. So, especially considering how cushioned the ear cups, they could have thrown a little something up there, right? Do you guys agree, do you guys disagree, agree, should they have done that? Let me know in the comments section. So, and then also, they do have a built-in microphone just like many other Bluetooth headphones. You can answer phone calls, do things like that. Mic quality leaves quite a bit to be desired. Obviously, a headphone in this price range, we have to be a little more forgiving. But I wanna make that clear to you guys. So, with that said, would I recommend you guys picking up the Skullcandy Riff Wireless? If you're an avid user, somebody who really loves their headphones and you wanna have the best sound experience for your money, I think I'm gonna pass, there are some better options out there in this price range. Now Skullcandy, they make some good products. These do have good sound quality, they are very light, and they have the rapid charge feature, and they look cool, let me give them that, they do look cool. But, you know, I just, I don't know. 12 hours of battery life, subpar microphone, and the lack of padding on the head? Plus the cheap plastic-y feel of them? If you can get 'em at like 30 or 40 bucks if they're on sale, I say go for it. But at full 50, nah man, I mean, unless you're gonna give them as a gift to someone, maybe you've got a teenager or a kid who just wants some cool lookin' headphones, then maybe. But if you're one of my fellow people, I don't consider myself an audiophile, but just somebody who's like an audio enthusiast, somebody who enjoys their headphones and enjoys their music, then you know what? It's gonna have to be a pass. And I'm just saying, this is just a basic headphone from Skullcandy, they have their Hesh series, they have the Crusher series, so they definitely have some really solid cans, but this one just leaves a bit to be desired. Especially, the competition in this price bracket is really bringing the heat, so it's gonna have to be a no from me on the Skullcandy Riff Wireless. Now, have you guys tried these out? Do you guys agree or disagree with my assessment? Let me know down in the comments section. And also, have you guys tried any other products, any other headphones around 50 bucks? Maybe 40 to 50 bucks that I should know about? Leave those down there as well, you guys know I love your suggestions. And as always, you guys liked this video, go ahead and smash that like button. If you guys didn't like this video, go ahead and hit that dislike button. Always one or two of you out there, I don't want you feeling left out.

They're everywhere. And I'm assuming a lot of you watching right now have them. The question is, Might they pose a health risk? A group of 250 scientists and experts have all signed a petition expressing serious concern that these types of AirPods or headphones pose a cancer risk. Question, should we be worried or not? Joining us via Skype to discuss is Doctor Ankur Parikh. Medical Director of Precision Medicine at Cancer Treatment Centers of America. Doctor Parikh, obviously technology, it's moving at the speed of light. It's hard to keep track of whether or not it's safe or not safe. You as an individual, what are your thoughts and / or concerns? Basically I don't really think there's a cancer risk per se, right now. I think a lot of the data that's out there is very mixed and really, we need to figure out how best to interpret all of this. But the amount of radiation that comes out, isn't something that's gonna potentially cause long-term damage as far as we know in terms of cancer risk. Honestly, by having your cell phone to your ear, you're gonna potentially have more radiation to your head area then you will with a wireless headphones. But with children, their hearing is still developing. Their nervous system is still developing. So when you put these wireless headphones in their ear, we don't know what the long-term side effects and consequences of the radiation, 10, 20 or 30 years from now is going to lead up to. And so what I worry about as a mom, is that my kids want these, the AirPods. They've sold 28 million of these in 2016 and all the kids are wearing them and we just don't really know, over time, that kind of exposure. By the time in 20 or 30 years, these children are developing some sort of neurologic tumors or ear tumors, I really feel like it's too late. No, and I agree with you and I have three children myself and I worry about their iPad time and headphones with themselves so I think the best that we can do, is just be mindful that we really don't have these answers yet. But it's like all things in life also. Dose-response, correct? Meaning, since there's no identified risk yet, and there are a lot of questions but these things are ubiquitous. If you put them in to make a phone call, okay. If you're listening to some music while you're working out, okay, but I actually see a lot of people now, they're just in. All the time. All day long. For hours. I bet people sleep with them in because you can forget that they're there. Before I let you go, is it really one of those, Okay, just be aware when they're in our ears so that you're mot walking around 24/7, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Because God forbid twenty years from now, we realize that there was an impact, you can't go back and change the last 20 years, if that's all you did, was have them in our ears the whole time? Is it fair to say to say to just be mindful Yes, that's a great point. Just be mindful, when you're not calling someone, not listening to music, just take the headphones out of your ear. Don't give yourself that extra chance or that extra risk to develop some kind of problem down the road. So I think everything in moderation. And do you think it's safe to say, Doctor Parikh, for those of us who are parents with small children, if they really need to use headphones for something, to keep it wired until we have more data and more research to see how this plays out? Yes and I think from a personal perspective, as being a father of three, I absolutely would. Doc, thanks so much for joining us. Thank you. (audience applause) And this is why I love our show because these are the kinds of questions that we don't always think about, and then they come up on our show, and then every single one of us, all our producers, everyone's thinking, Wait a minute, that's right. We don't have any data on these things so let's just be mindful. And what we've learned in medicine, if nothing else, that it's boring but moderation in most things, you'll always be okay. And if there's ever a question, as long as you moderate, for the most part, something like this, just be mindful. I love your points about kids. I think that's so well put. Young kids, just use the wired headphones if you're not sure. Are you using wireless? No, I don't just because I'm cheap and I haven't bought them yet. (audience laughs) (audience applauds) They are nice, they are nice. Look, I'm going to continue to use mine when I need to. Yeah but like you said, in moderation. If I were to acquire a pair, I'd probably would use it for an hour while I work out or something like that but I do see them on long-distance flights where people just have them in. It might be time for the show to get Doctor Parikh a little gift. I could trade you this. (audience laughs)"

365,Cx-uX0redHw,Cly Faker,UC9EPwKHQ9rFpquOGUILwQ2g,Vivitar True Wireless Earbuds | Bluetooth Headphone Review | Budget Buys Ep. 34,"Today I'm taking a look at the Vivitar True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds. I found these not too long ago at my local Five Below, and that caught me off guard a little bit. I'm used to seeing Vivitar branded items in other stores selling for much more than $5, and the same can be said for the Maxell products that have been popping up in Five Below recently. I have a theory about why these are showing up, but you'll have to watch the video to find out.

10:22:47.365008, what is up my peepholes this is your guy cly and welcome back to budget buys now today what I'm gonna be talking about are the vivitar true wireless earbuds that I found just the other day at my local 5 below and the really interesting thing about these is the fact that they're not from base jacks but instead a brand that you can find in stores other than 5 below in fact that seems to be a little bit of a trend because I've been finding Mac's sell products in there as well and I've got a theory about that which I'll cover later on in the video but for now let's take a look at the specs on the other side of the box specifically the battery life which is listed at one and a half hours and the audio driver size which is listed as 10 millimetres because those do make a difference in how these are going to perform and let's not forget the charging time which is listed at one to one and a half hours now enough gawking at the packaging let me show you what actually comes in the box so inside the box once you get are your earbuds which are quite obviously inspired by the Apple earpods you also get the charging cable which is a kind of unique little Y shaped monstrosity as well as a single sheet of very glossy paper to act as your manual now before I go any further I want to just point out you do not want to misplace your charging cable because this thing is so unique you're not gonna have an easy time tracking down a new one outside of certain situations and I'll talk about in a moment let me get this little guy out of the way first though now like I said earlier these are quite obviously a knockoff of the Apple earpods and that's not necessarily a bad thing because this design right here does a great job delivering sound and the simplicity of the design can make these kind of easy to use though at the same time the single function button can be a little obnoxious I'm not gonna lie because all you have is just one button per earbud and this mainly acts as your power button though depending on how long you press the button it does different things according to the manual a single quick click will pause or play your music as well as answer incoming calls and end calls to rapid clicks will redial the last number holding it down for one and a half seconds we'll skip to the next track when you're not receiving a call holding it down for two to three seconds will reject an incoming call and holding it down for three to four seconds will power it off or power it on and speaking of powering them on you can actually use a single earbud if you so desire but if you turn on both earbuds they automatically sync to each other and this is true automatic unlike the Lync speakers I reviewed previously where you have to do a little hullabaloo to sync them up the first time these connected to each other right out of the box so all you really have to do is turn on the earbud like so the little flashing light indicator turns on there I don't have the Bluetooth on my phone turned on so these won't automatically sync to that but when I turn the second one on give it a second and hopefully it'll automatically pair or it doesn't need my phone oh there it went okay it didn't need my phone notice how this one stopped blinking as fast the one on the right that means it is now paired with the other one but I don't really need to show you that anymore so let's turn them off there we go and that really covers all of the physical features of these earbuds outside of charging in fact let me demonstrate how to use the charging cable all you do ya shove it in like so plug it into a USB power bank and you're good to go now let's talk about my experience with the audio quality amazingly it's pretty good and for that I thank the fact that they imitated the Apple earpods ein it pulls in a little extra air thinks these the little vents on the side or at least that's my theory and it makes things sound a good bit richer the base was nice the trouble was nice not muddy not tinny kind of flat which is what I like but I won't say that their monitor quality by any stretch of the imagination as an added bonus these were true stereo not mono over stereo like a lot of a lower-cost Bluetooth earbuds have been recently when I did the test one of them output the right channel one of them output the left channel if something was centered it was centered it was great however it wasn't perfect it turns out at the factory they accidentally wired these backwards so the right ear bud was outputting the left channel and the left ear bud was outputting the right channel it is something that you can fix with software and it's really not that noticeable unless you're finicky about it like I am but it's there and that's actually where my theory comes in because this is a brand that I've seen it stores other than five below at prices well above $5 and suspiciously these earbuds are marked as 2019 unlike some of the other overstock that you see find its way to buy below like the you say gaming earbuds that are marked as being released in 2015 so the reason I think they hit 5 below the year they came out is due to the fact that more than likely the entire batch might be cross-wired aka they're just factory seconds in fact Vivitar is one of the brands I believe I've seen at Big Lots or at least I've seen similar brands at Big Lots selling this exact model of earbud with an additional case for $20 and I wouldn't be surprised if they want $10 for this setup right here if they were functioning properly it's kind of like the time I got really excited when I found a set of Kobe earbuds at Dollar Tree and that's see OB y by the way they're another brand of relatively low cost tech that is definitely worth more than $1 and when I got the earbuds home what I found was that it had two left earbuds and I don't mean both earbuds were outputting the left channel no they were actually one was outputting right what was outputting left when I say two left earbuds I mean literally and they were designed so that the left earbud only fit in the left ear the right earbud only fit in the right ears which rendered that set of earbuds absolutely useless and to be honest I was going to review them a while back and then misplace them so whoops now let's get back from that ranch shall we I did mention during it though that this exact model of earbud is being sold by multiple brands and that's because it's a generic from China if you check all the Express you can find this exact set up including the earbuds and the charger cable or between two to three dollars just do a search for true wireless earbuds or I believe it was I 7's tws you should find a ton of them even better if you're willing to go up to five dollars as opposed to two to three dollars you actually get the charger case so instead of getting this weird janky Y cable you'll get a case that you can store your earbuds in that can be charged using a standard USB cable and the case also has a built-in batteries so when you pass the hour-and-a-half mark or you just reach your destination while using these earbuds you can pop them into the case hit the power button and they'll charge right back up now I don't know what kind of battery life you get out of the charger case but it is going to be more than the initial hour and a half heck they even have more colors than just wide available I know I saw black pink and I think red and they had some with patterns on them from camouflage to flames it's kind of crazy there's so with all of that said you probably know my verdict on these already or at least most of it because these are not a terrible grab if you want to have a set of truly wireless earbuds that look like Apple earpods and you don't mind having potentially swapped channels and you don't want to wait up to a month to get them so yeah in that situation this isn't a bad grab for five dollars however if you're willing to wait the extra time and dig around on Aliexpress you can do so much better for so much cheaper I think that about covers it with the vivitar Tru wireless earbuds and to be perfectly honest my experience with these has me wondering what's wrong with the Maxell headphones that I keep seeing pop up at five below these days I might have to review one to find out but that is for a later date for now ünzile next time this is your guy cly signing off

367,486ud_GpEcg,Martijn Wester,UChG8A_Wy1nkPoSOCAwQB_MQ,✓ Xiaomi Mi True Wireless 𝗘𝗮𝗿𝗽𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀 𝟮 𝗕𝗮𝘀𝗶𝗰 Review 🔥,"Those Xiaomi Mi True Wireless Earphones 2 Basic are basically the more affordable version of the normal Mi True Wireless earphones 2, but are still quite amazing! This is the international version, in China they are sold inder the Xiaomi Mi Air 2 SE name. Both are basically the same, only the price is different. CN version price: https://bit.ly/Mi-Air-2-SE Int. version: https://www.mi.com/global/mi-true-wireless-earphone-2-basic/ (39,99 EUR)

Besides the design and comfortability, the Xiaomi TWS earphones 2 Basic are one to consider for the audio and definitely for the call quality if your wallet isn’t that big. Battery-life on the Mi Earphones 2 Basic is more than acceptable, if not, very good.. it’s just that in my case, the earphones are very loosely in my ears after some movements and therefore slowly sliding and falling out. Last thing is of course the design, and it’s up to you if you like this (semi) knock-off look.

Preston|Amazfit|Huami|ZenBuds|PowerBuds|headphones|sleep buds|sleep headphones|true wireless,2020-10-07 10:22:47.365164, hey everyone this is Dom from tech advisor here at CES and I am with the Huami Amazfit ZenBuds which are in ear sleep headphones that actually look way cooler than that sounds if you don't know Huami or Amazfit they are a wearables company so fitness trackers smartwatches that kind of thing they've been making the mi band for Xiaomi for years and a couple years ago they expanded into their own line of amazfit they make a load watches under the bip and the Stratos and GTS lines all of that here at CES they're basically announcing their push into the States and an expansion to more of an ecosystem business model which includes two new product lines one believe it or not is treadmills they've announced two treadmills but more interesting for us right now is headphones so again two pairs of headphones there's one pair called the power beats which are basically pretty standard true wireless sports headphones but they're pretty affordable what we are really interested in though is these the ZenBuds so these are in-ear sleep headphones so this is the case obviously get them open there's a nice sideways sliding motion which I really love and there they are those are the zenbuds what you can probably tell especially once I take them out is these are tiny they are really really really small they are also very soft that is a very sort of squidgy silicon and even the plastic here is just a little bit softer than you expect it's not super tough on the ears very soft silicon pad there obviously that's important because if you're going to be wearing these things while you sleep they need to be really soft they need to be really comfortable so why the hell would you wear sleep headphones they're not actually designed to be used as headphones I've actually been asking Amazfit and the people I've been asking have been a bit unclear on whether you can use these to listen to your own music or not but the main purpose is that they will play soothing sounds so basically you put these in they will play sort of a nice set of sounds I imagine you get a choice sort of like you know birds tweeting waves crashing that kind of things to help like lull you to sleep they are not noise cancelling at least not actively but the design is kind of passive noise cancellation that silicon tip will block your ear but to help keep noise out then you get the nice soothing sounds playing that will hopefully lull you to sleep then while you are sleeping and while you are falling asleep it is it's got heart rate monitoring tech in there so it's even from your ear it's measuring your heart rate it's detecting how much you move your body position that kind of thing so then you'll get a full sleep report in the morning telling you about how you slept when you hit deep sleep all that kind of tracking that you might get from a watch but you can get it from in-ear headphones that also play music that helps lull you to sleep battery life obviously the kind of thing that's an issue most true Wireless buds would not last long enough to get you through a full night these will manage 12 hours part of the way they do that is that they will turn off the sounds once you off asleep once it detects that you're sort of are in deep sleep based on your body movement heart rate it stops the sounds thus conserves battery so that 12-hour count is based on the idea that you'll have three hours of sounds like three hours where you're still falling asleep and then it'll do another nine hours of just the tracking so actually that should be way more than enough for most people and then you charge it up the next day ready to use the next night another little nice touch in ear alarm so if you wake up at a different time to your partner this will actually just set off an alarm that goes off in your ear so they never hear it should be enough to wake you up but whoever you're sharing a bed with won't be woken up which is a really nice little touch and just design-wise these things are really lovely I mean we get that back in the case obviously we've got the swivel case the whole thing is super light because of course they don't need a big battery in the case because you're realistically  gonna charge it every day I think there might be some in the case I'm not sure but it's not a lot so it gives the whole thing really nice it's really pretty this is a night matte finish not very fingerprinting not very glossy USB-C charging and then another little touch is it's just got a grippy ring there so it means when that sits on your bedside table it'll be kind of static it'll say still it won't get pushed around too much again because this isn't designed to be something you carry around with you like an air pods case this is something that's just meant to sit on the tables stay there and then you open it up every night get the headphones out and off you go we don't have a firm release date on these yet I've been told probably February but we'll see but it will be a global release Asia Europe North America there may be a bit staggered I don't know if you'll be simultaneous but that's the plan all those markets and all cost 149.90 in dollars don't know pounds of euros or whatever but you can probably guess roughly where it's gonna be based on that yeah so I mean I haven't had a chance to use these and I don't want to put these demo models in my ears because that's icky but they look really nice they look really comfortable the concept is great I'm really keen to see how these work out because I think in a asleep headphones make a lot more sense than the big over ear sleep headphones I've seen brands  like kokoon putting out this CES so stay tuned this week where it's a yes we've got a few more videos left to go from the show and like and subscribe all of that keep an eye on tech advisor we've got a lot more on the way
371,I2TxTOKy95Y,Erin Lawrence,UCDGqNf14HSF9v8e-Qmp7VXA,Sennheiser RS 175 wireless TV headphones,"Read more:https://blog.bestbuy.ca/
 There are so many reasons you’d want to listen to the TV with headphones; you don’t want to wake the kids or your spouse if you’re watching a movie late at night, you don’t want to be distracted by those same family members… maybe you have noisy neighbours who are loud talkers and just want to tune them out, or your significant other is out in the yard again with the hedge trimmer running. Not to mention that if you’re hard of hearing, you might need a little more direct sound.

If you’ve done any research into getting headphones connected to your TV you know it’s not simple. Most TVs have a headphone jack, but come on… no one wants to run a cable 10 feet from the flat screen to the sofa. And most headphones are Bluetooth, and not a lot of TVs have Bluetooth (though you could hack something together with a Bluetooth transmitter, but I digress).

The easiest way to get direct to your ears audio from your TV is with a pair of headphones dedicated to this purpose. Sennheiser RS 175 is a specialty pair of headphones that’s designed to work perfectly with your TV.

https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/sennheiser-sennheiser-over-ear-sound-isolating-wireless-headphones-black-rs-175/10370611.aspx?

What’s in the box?

Inside the  package is:
Headphones
Rechargeable Batteries
Base Station 
Audio cables; optical & analogue
Power cable


Set up
To get these headphones set up you’ll need to connect the base station to your TV, receiver, cable box, sound bar or streaming device.

There’s two ways to connect the base station; with a digital optical audio cable if your devices are newer, or using the analogue 3.5mm jack. As I’m connecting to an older TV, I elected to use the Aux cable. It’s as simple as plugging it into the back of the base station, then connecting it to the TV. 

Once connected there’s a small switch on the back you need to flip to choose which type of cable you’re using to connect. Then, turn the power on to the headphones.

It’s possible to connect two sets of headphones to the transmitter if you want to use more than one set, too.

Sound Quality

Let’s get straight to the heart; how do the Sennheiser RS 175 sound? Big, bold and powerful, to put it in a nutshell. The headphones deliver a rich, all-encompassing sound. It’s easy to hear things like birds chirping outside, or the distant trickle of a fountain in an episode of Bosch on Amazon Prime. Voices sound clear and dialogue cuts through well.

Music in these headphones (mainly from movies or TV themes) is luscious and sounds great. Listening to music videos is a delight. The audio is perfectly balanced and the sound fills your head in the best possible way. The bass is really great too; not too jaw-rattling, but decently deep and vibrational.

Lag when watching video?

I tested these headphones out with a variety of content; mainly streaming TV like Netflix, YouTube, and Apple TV content like movies and music videos. I can say there’s no lag of any kind when watching content, as there can be when using Bluetooth headphones to watch videos on a smartphone.
Battery life & Charging
These headphones take forever to charge up. 

Charging after the first power-up takes about eight and a half hours. All day to recharge? Man, that seems excessive in this world of 15 minute fast charging and gadgets that are ready to go in an hour.

Range & dropouts?

When I was using the Sennheiser RS 175s I most often used them directly in front of the TV, at a distance of about 10 feet. There were zero dropouts during my test period when using them like this. I tried getting up and walking around my main floor while wearing the headphones and again, there were no dropouts or breakup. 

Other uses? Phones, tablet, computer?
You might be wondering if you can use these headphones with other devices. The short answer is no. There’s no Bluetooth in these headphones, which is what you need to pair with most smartphones or tablets. There’s also no headphone jack to connect them hard-wired. These are dedicated to TV and video viewing.

Overall review

If you want headphones connected to your TV, these are an outstanding choice. They sound great, they’re easy to set up and they have a long lasting battery.

Downsides? The charging time takes forever. I also found it difficult to find a convenient place to stash the base station while still keeping it plugged in to AC and the audio connection. I ended up with it awkwardly wedged beside my TV during my test period.

https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/sennheiser-sennheiser-over-ear-sound-isolating-wireless-headphones-black-rs-175/10370611.aspx?
These headphones are also quite pricey. At about $379CAD they are an investment, especially considering they are tied to your TV and your TV only.

Overall if you’re looking for durable, comfortable and reliable headphones for your TV, you’ll love the Sennheiser RS 175s.",28,28448,83.0,668.0,15.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I2TxTOKy95Y/hqdefault.jpg,SennheiserTV|TV|headphones|best|television|wireless|how to|review|besat|connect headphones to

Bluetooth connection though you could hook something together with a wireless Bluetooth transmitter but I digress I'm Aaron for Best Buy Canada's blog and the easiest way to get direct to your ears audio from your TV is with a pair of headphones dedicated to this purpose the Sennheiser RS 175 is a specialty pair of headphones but it's designed to work perfectly with your TV we'll take a look at the setup for these the sound quality durability and more but a heads up that if you liked this video please hit that like button and give us a sub because it does help us keep making more videos so what's inside the box inside you'll find the headphones of course and some rechargeable batteries that will go inside the ear cups you'll get the base station plus two audio cables an analog cable and a digital optical cable there's also a power cord to get these headphones set up you'll need to connect the base station to your TV receiver cable box and bar or streaming device there's two ways to connect to the base station with the digital optical audio cable if your devices are newer or using the analog 3.5 millimeter jack as I'm connecting to an older TV I opted to use the aux cable it's as simple as plugging it into the back of the base station then connecting it to your TV once connected there's a small switch on the back you do need to flip to choose which type of cable connection you're using then turn the power on to the headphones now in some setups you may also need to change your audio output settings either on the TV or the receiver these options are usually found in your devices audio settings menu a word of advice here depending on your setup you might not be able to get audio from the TVs built-in speakers or sound bar if you've redirected the sound to the headphones some configurations will only allow for one output at a time meaning if you want to go back to listening to the sound bar or your TV's internal speakers you'll need to pull the plug so to speak now it is possible to connect two sets of headphones to this transmitter if you want to use more than one set to and that's worth noting also I did try to use the optical cable to connect to my second-generation Apple TV but no matter what I did and which settings I tried I couldn't seem to get any audio out of it I don't know if it's because the Apple TV is older if it was my older LG TV or something else but either way that setup didn't work for me one other note the base station is very tall and with the headphones on it's wide and bulky these might be a bit tough to hide away alright let's get straight to the heart of the matter how do they stand highs are Rs 175 sound I would say big bold and powerful to put it in a nutshell the headphones deliver a rich all-encompassing sound and it's easy to hear things like birds chirping outside or the distant trickle of a fountain in an episode of Bosch on Amazon Prime voices sound clear and dialogue definitely cuts through really well now music in these headphones and mainly for movies or TV themes is luscious and sounds great but listening to dedicated music like with music videos is really a delight the audio is really perfectly well balanced the sound fills your head in the best possible way the bass is really great too it's not too jaw rattling but it's decently deep and vibrational overall it sounds really great these headphones have two special features there's something called bass boost and surround sound bass boost increases the audio bass response while the two virtual surround sound modes offer a more spacial and livelier stereo sound effect using the bass boost provides a definite and noticeable difference in bass it adds quite a bit of low-end that's most noticeable in music or music video playback if you are watching a concert with these headphones on it would absolutely provide outstanding audio quality now the surround sound feature is similarly noticeable it does create more of a 3d audio effect where the regular setting just seems to direct the sound kind of straight into your ears the surround sound seems to me to provide a wider audio soundscape that does mimic real life and I really I enjoyed this feature so much I ended up leaving it on for most of my test time I tested these headphones out with a variety of content mainly streaming TV like Netflix and YouTube I can say there's no lag of any kind when watching content as there can be when using Bluetooth headphones to watch videos on a smartphone these headphones are big and bulky they're definitely not made to be incognito but that's okay because you're at home right in terms of style they aren't a lot to look at either but these are more about the sound quality the headphones are adjustable so you can get a good fit for your head size the ear cups are well padded and provide a good amount of insulation against any outside noise they're bulky but they're not overly heavy for their size these can get pretty loud - they'd be ideal for someone who's hard of hearing since they can crank it up without disturbing others there's controls on the right ear cup as well so you can adjust the volume and other settings without getting up these headphones take forever to charge up the initial charge takes about 16 hours you're supposed to get about 18 hours of listening on a single charge and provided you put the headphones back on their dock here after you're done with them in theory you should never really need to test that timing I didn't have them long enough to test them out so that I could fully wear the battery out so I can't say if that number is accurate but charging after the first powerup takes about eight and a half hours all day to recharge man that seems excessive in this world of 15-minute fast charging and gadgets that are ready to go in an hour when I was using the Sennheiser RS 175 s I most often used them directly in front of the TV at a distance of about 10 feet there was zero dropouts during my test period when I was using them like this I tried getting up and walking around my main floor while wearing the headphones and again no dropouts no breakup you might be wondering if you can use these headphones with other devices the answer is no there's no Bluetooth in these headphones which is really what you'd need to pair with most smartphones or tablets there's also no physical headphone jack to connect them if you wanted to connect these hardwired to anything nope these are dedicated to TV and video viewing overall if you want great headphones connected to your TV these are an outstanding choice they sound great they're easy to setup and they have a long lasting battery downsides the charging time does take forever I also found it difficult to find a convenient place to stash the base station while still keeping it plugged into AC and the audio connection I ended up with it awkwardly wedged beside my TV during my test period these headphones are also quite pricey they sell for about three hundred and seventy nine Canadian dollars meaning they're pretty much an investment especially considering they're tied to your TV and your TV only overall if you're looking for durable comfortable and reliable headphones for your television that also sound phenomenal you're definitely going to love the Sennheiser RS 175 s if you want to read more about

review|skullcandy crusher,2020-10-07 10:22:47.365231, what's going on guys it's Gino from modern accessory review and today we are talking about the Skullcandy crusher wireless headphones these headphones were released a couple years ago and are still very popular against its newer competitors I personally picked these up for a hundred and eighteen dollars because I believe the best review should be from someone who has experience with the product as always I have my link in the description below for the most updated price if you guys want to check them out I've been feeling they will go on sale soon so is the school candy crusher right for you let's find out in the review [Music] starting off with the build quality and design I really enjoy the way these headphones look and how well they're built when I first took them out of the box I could tell right away that these headphones will last me a long time the ear cups in headband are made out of a really durable plastic and the top of the headband is made out of synthetic leather which really gives the headphones a high quality looking feel the bottom of the headband is made from a rubbery material with some padding I wish there was more padding in the headband because when I tried these on for the first time I felt some tension from the headband after a while but I have gotten used to it now and I can wear them longer without noticing anything we also have stainless steel adjustments and soft leather new cups for comfort there was definitely a bit of clamping force when I wear these but they are still comfortable enough for me and probably for most average consumers however if you are looking for the most comfortable headphones possible for very long term use then I would recommend the bose noise-canceling 700 but these things also fold up and Skullcandy included a nice pouch which makes these great for traveling in terms of buttons we have a total of four they are all very simple and easy to use on the right ear cup we have the volume buttons which allow you to skip to the next song or previous song if you hold it for three seconds and we have the power button which also allows you to pause play or with a double tab you can access Siri or Google assistant on the left ear cup we have a really cool feature that allows you to adjust how much bass you want simply slide the button up and down to increase or decrease the bass but the one thing I don't like about this is that the slider will show some scratches or wear and tear over time below the slider we have a micro USB for charging and a three-and-a-half millimeter input for physical connections Skullcandy also claims up to 40 hours of battery life which is insane and probably one of the best in the market we also have an incredible quick charge feature which allows you to get three hours of playtime with just ten minutes of charging in terms of bluetooth it is just as easy to pair as any other headphones when you turn the headphones on it will automatically start to pair your device and if it doesn't automatically pair all you have to do is connect it through your Bluetooth settings on your device which takes less than 30 seconds the range is about average and I haven't had any problems with it I also haven't experienced any latency issues which makes these great for watching videos now let's get to the most important part of the review the sound quality I always find myself adjusting the bass with the slider button in which I think is a really unique and cool feature to have but of course the more bassy you like your music and the less crispness and clearness is going to be in the vocals what makes these headphones great in my opinion is that you have the option to listen with less bass if you like more clear audio separation with the instruments and vocals or you can listen with a ton of bass if you like to have that extra character and your music I would have liked to see some noise cancelling as well but these do keep a lot of the noise out with the sealed fit I will say though if you aren't a fan of bass and you would like noise cancelling then there are some other headphones out there that do better with clear and precise vocals and audio separation I would recommend the Sony WH 1000 XM threes and the bose noise-canceling 700 s another thing I noticed is that some audio leaks out so if you're listening to music over a 60% volume then people close to you might be able to hear your music so is the Skullcandy crusher right for you well if you are looking for some headphones that are affordable have tons of base an incredible battery life the great build quality and design simple buttons and are good for traveling then I would recommend these headphones for you but like I mentioned earlier if you aren't a fan of bass and would rather have that noise cancelling and clear vocals then the Sony WH 1000 Exim threes and the bose noise-canceling 700 are some of my favorite headphones and would be a great thanks so much for watching guys and if you learned anything from this video make sure to hit that subscribe and like button also make sure to ask any questions you have below and I will work hard to get back to you without further to do I'll see you guys in my next video peace
374,H2XcSUrBftc,Tech Spurt,UCVLN0tY51ewH44wUtx3YZTA,Lypertek Tevi Review | Best true wireless headphones for battery life,"Reviewing the Lypertek Tevi true wireless headphones, the best buds I've tested for battery life. A full charge gives you just under ten hours of music playback, while the charging case can power the Tevis up several times over.

With a UK price of £99, these are definitely among my favourite Bluetooth earbuds that cost under £100. They're compact and light enough to comfortably wear for a few hours at a time, while the snug, secure fit means the Lypertek Tevi buds are suitable for jogging. They're IPX7 water resistant as well, so you can rock them out in the rain.

For audio quality, they're solid for the price. I find Samsung's Galaxy Buds are better for rock and dance with stronger lows, but these Bluetooth true wireless headphones offer impressive clarity, powerful volume and respectable passive noise cancelling. And for battery life, the Tevi earbuds really are the best I've reviewed - although Creative's Outlier Gold promises 14 hours from a single charge! Check back soon for my full verdict on those.",28,26809,102.0,419.0,13.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H2XcSUrBftc/hqdefault.jpg,lypertek tevi|lypertek tevi review|lypertek tevi true wireless|lypertek tevi

10:22:47.365258, hello there you gorgeous person you this Christmas experts I'm here with a new light but tech TVs quite the little name there they're another pair of true wireless earbuds so many at the moment but these are the set themselves out because they're only 99 pounds which is pretty affordable as far as these wireless earbuds go and - they've got up to 70 hours of battery life using that battery case ten hours at a time and then you can get six full recharges using the case apparently which is better than pretty much any other buds out there that I've tested out so I'm gonna show you what's in the box and then zip forward magically in time a few days and give you my full review and more on the latest and greatest tech please do POG subscribe and ding that notifications bell Cheers so I've never even heard of light detect before these guys got in touch so we're really interested to see how the sound quality and everything mirrors up to some of the biggest rivals out there cause Samsung Galaxy buds cost a little bit more pretty much everyone is doing there or not a wireless earbuds now correct you get these damn things out the box oh my is a tight fit there we go there's the actual carry kids and then the buds themselves oh and some spare rubbery tips as well so you can change them depending on how big or small your look calls ours you can see just some different sizes there and there is the charging cable as well nice bit type see which is always good to see do like it when they use Type C these days roll in the old micro USB not Lea is it reversible also most modern phones use Type C now so I need you to have to carry around two different cables when you're heading off on a long trip and you got a QuickStart guide as well which is properly wedged in there there we go and then just shows you the parent process and everything but I'm expecting it to be very straight forward indeed so these are the actual like patek TVs as you can see they're fairly chunky wireless earbuds but nothing too extreme and of course lots of smart tech packed away in there so hopefully should prove comfortable I'll cover that in my full in-depth review towards the end of this video and the actual charging case itself as well I really really like it's got lovely fabric style finish quite unique similar I guess to the likes the Google buds except hopefully the light detects boards suck and of course you just stick the actual buds when there's a wrong netic connection and as you can see there the charger case already has some power in it because the buds are now charging and you just power that way and there you go you've got nice little charge and that light indicator on the outside as well obviously gears itself is quite chunky definitely thicker than the like so the Samsung Galaxy buds care stuff like that but should still just about we pocket sizes though you don't mind having a slightly unsightly bulge and of course you can attach them to stuff that using that as well so yeah and of course they're on the Mike is your type-c USB port just stick that in where the charging kit itself is running out of juice and others here they reckon you'll get up to 70 hours of use from a fully charged kids in it and stuff right I mean testing out that I protect em use for a good few days now I'm gonna sit flat ninety nine pound asking price pretty solid value in one feature in particular is very impressive indeed now first up I do like the dinky design of these things they're not exactly the most revolutionary of true Wireless here buzz they look like quite a lot of rivals but they are nice and dinky as you can see there they just fit neatly into your inner ear sanctum they're reasonably subtle little just out too far or anything and they're pretty comfortable to wear for a good few hours at a time as well once you find the right rubbery tips to fit your ear shape they just sit in there nicely and they don't feel like that sort of passion on your inner ear or anything but as you can see they're then nice and firmly in there there's a lot of runnin for trains in the like this week and they have never felt like they're gonna pop out at any point the ipx7 a water-resistant as well so no problems if you get caught in a downpour great news if you live in the UK like I do and you can even drop them in your cup of herbal tea and they won't break just give a quick wiping off will be up so you find the buds work independently of one another as well either one can be the master so you can use just the left one by itself absolutely fine or just the right one by itself and if you using both you can just take one out put one back in the case the other one will continue to work seamlessly so it's all good that's how I did notice that when I pulled them out the case if I didn't pull the left one out first occasionally they would struggle to work as a pair as to make sure you always take the left one out of the case before the right one and then I protect em used to actually have a little push buttons here on the flat surface right on the edge as well for sure that was comfortable to use because of course when you push the button and you are basically driving the buds into your ear holes so not only is what you'll want to do is you want to solve pitch the buds and then tap like so kind of a little bit awkward but it does work and the buttons themselves are fantastic you get one on each bud just push in once either buds will pause or play your music if you double push the right one that will actually raise the volume if you double push the - one that will drop the volume back down against is great to see that they work it independently like that and of course if you want to skip the track it's a triple tap of this one you want to go back a track it's a triple tap of the left one it's of course if you only use in walnut buds then you won't get that full functionality but it's great that with just a single push button on each bud they managed to incorporate all of these different controls and when I first started tested out the light detectors I was a little bit concerned because the Bluetooth connection with my smartphone was really not very good it was constantly cutting out stammering stuttering the kids in the music would just pause for a few seconds before finally resuming thankfully just seems to have been initial jitters because after a couple of hours they were absolutely fine so that the kids are tiny little stomach when I hibernate my smartphone but otherwise no worries you got full app tanks support and everything as well for syncing up your sound with whatever video you're watching at the time that'll seems to work absolutely fine that's for the sound quality well the lovely stock TVs are pretty good for that 99 pound asking price and force the folk music does bizarre things like that they're not entirely well suiters they don't quite have the power behind them to really make those tracks resonate as the bass is a little bit weak the drums don't really slap the way they would really hope for as you would get with something with much more expensive like the the power beats Pro for instance so the tongue is definitely better suited to something like pop music classical music things like that the clarity is really good all the instruments come through clearly voices again the vocals very really nice and clear and for 99 pounds definitely happy on top volume these things will absolutely blast your eardrums as well and the clarity is still pretty good even on those higher volumes I tend to keep it around the mid volume range and I found that with the properly fitting rubber tips then all these cancellation was actually pretty good as well have any active noise cancellation or anything like that they do a really good job of blocking out surround and sound from the even when I was on a tree and on a tube somewhere really noisy didn't have to boost the volume up at all but the area where the levee stocked heavies really impressed is the battery life frankly the battery performers on these things is really good now i protect reckons you get around 10 hours of use from a single charge in that case and I was like yeah show me I'll have whatever pills you've been popping no chance where they last a full 10 hours but actually after 90 minutes I checked the Bluetooth battery power written on my smart phone there was still at 90% was like this is same could they actually go beyond the ten hour limit they didn't quite manage to break ten hours but they came really really close that's about double what you get from most rival true wireless earbuds some very very strong indeed and when they do need a recharge just shove them back in the handy carry case and apparently you'll get up to six full recharges out of this case as well I've been rocking it for a good few days now and I'm not even close to wearing this thing out so it definitely seems to do the job they're pretty faster charging as well just fifteen minutes and they'll give you a couple of hours of use and that is why I think of the line protect every is after a full week of testing as you see not quite perfect but for 99 pounds they have a lot to offer including that really impressive battery life that's definitely the best battery life of any true wireless earbuds that I've personally tested but that said I did get an email just this morning from creative about then you only gold true wireless earbuds apparently forced 14 hours of battery life on a single charge so I'll be getting those into a review those and see how they stack up against the light protector about the same price as well around that sub 100 pound mark so I'll be very interested in indeed let me know what you think in the comments down below if you've got your own personal preferred brand of true wireless earbuds as well which you really really endorse especially on that one 100 pound walk be definitely be great to hear your thoughts in the comments down below as well and one of the latest greatest tech please do pod subscribe editing that notification spell Cheers [Music]

pat|g933,2020-10-07 10:22:47.365281, [Music] hey guys Patrick here and today I've got an awesome unboxing for you this just arrived from Logitech and it is not released in Australia for about another couple of days I think I'm pretty sure you can pre-order it at ple right now or your local PC gaming shop gogo - JB guys they are the price levitate gear normal process are at places like ple or msy so check those guys out this is the g5 3/3 wireless headphones that have just come out in Australia I know they've been around in America for a while I know there was reviews out there I know but this is Australia my friend so I'm gonna box this now and hopefully we'll in a week or so I'll have a review for you guys because I really want to use it because I have the first ones that came out the G 933 and I am in love with these headphones I use it so much so that I got rid of my speakers which were Logitech speakers because these headphones were so much better so this to me I feel like is the sort of the baby brother of for example the Jean 900 here at the G 344 channel was is now the baby brother I suppose and I feel but this is just a step down with a little bit less features maybe and little bit less flakiness I don't know to be still I wouldn't travel with these for example but let's see what's inside the box and I'll get you a full review but from the outside my friends very nice box matte back and we've got here 7.1 cinematic gaming with pro G or your drivers we've got 1515 freedom for 15 hours to 15 meters 50 now is that sounds pretty damn good I know these guys get about eight but they also have a few more extra lights on the sides but 15 hours sounds excellent it could even be better top sports mesh ear cups I don't know what you can say about sports things and gaming gear supposed to be better I don't know I want to check it out how they feel different to the g9 three threes these don't feel a bit soft and a plushy kind of feels like cheap plush inside to be honest it hasn't bothered me because they're so large they go over in a cup my ears but I'm wondering how these ones will go and if they're the same I will definitely point it out but let's so let's open the box quickly and see what's inside my little trusty knife or there we go what else is on the side I guess a little bit of writing a little bit technical details big g-53 bit technical details they're just going to sound good who cares what kind of Drive check out right yes it's a simpler box than the other on the other one big hump with the applies baguette at the box but this one I think it will be a nice simple box empty box and we have the wireless receiver of course in some sort of very tight plastic I haven't really seen something like that before well it's like guys come on like also protecting or as a petition from Team oh oh okay still pieces of it left well not the most exciting unboxing there all right that's that and we've got the arm oh the headphones some instructions and the cable that's it just like the other mouse that we unboxed before not much inside set the cable seems like a decent length I think you can use this while actually game so yes full rubber has got no sort of material on it no sheathing your cover but seems like a good quality USB cable and you know sometimes these are hard to come by so you know take it with what it is ah one feature that I can already see that is missing that the other one has is multiple sources so this one does not have a jack in it that you can put a laptop on the side into your wireless receiver and get an extra sound in there so that is one difference but I can already notice things start and let's get in I see the actual headphones or category very nice very nice indeed okay okay it feels a little bit different but it could just be that they're new and the foreign feels very very similar if I would say almost the same before me I don't know I'm being so picky mmm and the sides fingerprints I'm going to get on it easily shiny I've got a button some cool oh I like that it's pretty loose that's pretty cool on/off button and charge it up in a minute and we've got the microphone here and it does extend I don't particularly like this extension as photos do you need it it becomes very wavy and dunno it holds very well so I don't know but look I mean look at that this is very loose I will see we'll see what happened about both and you'll see how comfortable it is to put on well guys it is a lot lighter than the G 933 and that is the first and best thing I can notice right out it's so much lighter hole my goodness and it feels very very comfortable it is definitely cutting my ears and now I'm getting excited to use it for a long gaming session wow this could actually be good this doesn't hide out that's one any kind of users headphones going to sticks out a little bit I suppose it to know that if you're into that charging port on a button and a G button and that is it I'm ecstatic it looks pretty good to me keen to and excited to see what it's about and I'll get a review thing I soon so we're not before buying let's just see if it's actually worth one hundred and sixty-nine dollars being into the tides right now on pre-order thank you very much guys for watching and I'll catch you later now remember to check out that competition I've got going it is ending at the end of this month so get your common sense and subscribe it that's the way you're going to get in the drawer I'll catch you later thank you so much [Music]

10:22:47.365326, hey this is Silas and I'm going to do a review on the RS 170 bison Heiser the difference between the RS 170 and the RS 180 is these are closed and the other ones are open so many of these are open I chose to do the 170s because I play games and whenever I watch films I don't want the person next day and hear me nor do I want to hear them with open headphones you hear everybody and everybody can hear whatever gunshots music whatever it is pretty clearly to the person next to you really distracting if you're on planes is not like you hear the noise the person next to you can hear you or if you know let's say the searchers trying to study and they have listened to everything going on your headset can be very distracting so one 7yz it was these are the wireless radio frequency from what I gather they're at 2.4 gigahertz to 2.4 8 gigahertz that's the signal range so if you've got a cell phone a cell phone but like if you're one of those people who still have the landline with a broadcasting signal up like 2.4 then they could cause interference so obviously try to find things that aren't on the same frequency a little bit about the Box obviously you can see into it sorry for the being really really oversaturated but comes in a standard plastic blister bag pop this open coming out pretty easy maybe take some scissors to cut whatever tape they put on to it but else why I was pretty frustration free not a big deal I got mine from Amazon also comes with a 2 year warranty which is pretty nice so that way you know if you break it or something else to it you can always do something about it so which is nice so anyway the next thing we're going to talk about is kind of inside of it other than the headset but you get obviously a nice light box inside the light box comes with a instruction manual and the CD haven't had to use the CD and this assuming that has to do with some extra options but it gave a sound card or built-in sound probably already has options to deal with that Danielle warning I'm not sure what the warning is for maybe if you play your headphones too loud but I guess it's got to be included the same way that they include don't operate heavy machinery on children's medication inside is the other little box comes with cable to connect it a little anti kink thing drive it a bunch of different connectors so that way if you live in a different part of the world it works for you I assume it's just a global standard cover all if you buy it in some other portion it's good to go so on the actual product itself it's again it's got a giant radio frequency tower and the headphones themselves sitting on top of it there you go you just set it down and it it goes now the nice thing is is that lets you literally just set it down on top of it and it starts charging I don't think it really matters which way you even put it as long as it's sitting on there and making contact the contacts themselves are on the front there and on the back here right there sit on top I'm good to go on the front of the charging dock station has whether or not it's charging the base is the double-up base basically doubles your base makes it a lot more pronounced your surround option which is pretty cool especially for gaming it sometimes calls warbling we need to some sounds something like that that's the best way I can put it but that's generally if it's not good code interest around I personally like surround so it works good for me back to the actual docking station itself is the jack that you can plug into just about anything your CD player your TV your computer or sound card or backing about motherboard here is your it has an attenuator it goes eight decibels to zero decibels I put my zero an eight a little quiet and obviously your power supply goes into the wall pretty standard bugs in there hit the power button in the front and off you go so a little bit about the headphones themselves sound quality wise they remind me of the HD to 80s they're pretty good responsiveness they're pretty fast sound great they're really soft they're super light that was the other thing that was really surprised by a lot of wireless headsets I have the World of Warcraft as well and tons of others as you can see I reviewed before these light it's pretty impressive they're built pretty pretty solid they're not too stiff on the head they block out a lot of sound one thing that kind of sound like 280 they remind me of 100 autocrat headphones they're about $170 on Amazon right now that's where I generally get most of my stuff so it's pretty good that way you've got a good sound and it's $100 per headset and it's wireless and it's better than any gaming wireless headset sound you're basically gonna find however is not without its faults a couple things if you use Ventrilo or stings go silent for a little while on skype but we says anything you'll have a little bit of time where you say something in a goes like a very very low of noise but it doesn't lose it so like I could hear everything but right before that sound pitches in it kicks back on and kicks back off can be kind of annoying if do the thing bothers you but it doesn't actually cut out the person's voice oh it's not so bad obviously it lengthens and yadda so once again this radio frequency as far as cutting out some people complaining that they have a lot of cutting out maybe they're getting cross interference I only have a cell phone in this house and a microwave so I don't have anything that really interferes per se so I always take that in consideration if you have a wireless mouse a wireless keyboard cell phones a house that's running on like the same frequency 2.4 gigahertz you're gonna get some crosstalk you're gonna lose it I don't have any of the issues that some people have I've been able to walk most of the me into my house into the next room start to get a little kept it loose a little fuzzy sometimes it'll just cut straight out but it's pretty good most of time you can listen to it walk all right around the house and it's usually fairly good once you radiofrequency look out for that you can go you don't have to be in line of sight you can put it off to the side but honestly wherever you put it put it close enough that it can talk back so once again this is the review on the RS 170 s once again the only difference between these and the Rs 180s is these are the closed ones meaning that they block out sound they don't have as wide and listening field doesn't feel as natural but still blocks up sounds they sound great they remind me of to 80s but without a cord it'll be a great purchase for you if you'd like to be able to get up and walk away or if you'd like to pair a great set of headphones wirelessly and have your mic on your desk for instance I have you prefer using really nice mics as opposed to move Mike coming off with a cheap pair headset anyway once again this is the rs.1 70s and my style has

guys this is Tampa Tech and I'm going to show you how to connect your headphones to your Amazon fire TV or Amazon fire TV stick or if you have Amazon fire TV built into your TV that works as well I want to show you what headphones to get to give you the best TV watching experience we're going to be using the Kohen headphones because it has the latest bluetooth version 5.0 which gives you extra battery life longer range and faster data transfer it also has built-in aptX low audio latency so you don't have any audio/video sync problems it also has active noise cancellation my AC unit sounds like a freight train you can hear it right now very loud very annoying but when I flick that switch it blocks out majority of that noise which is great there's no audio leakage coming out of these headphones unlike the beats solo which sit on your ear you have a lot of audio leakage in a person sitting next to you might hear that audio this it's around your ear very soft cushions and will block out most of that sound so the person sitting next to you won't most likely hear the audio coming from your headphones I Technic or a little less expensive both of these headphones are under $100 but the eye technic is around 55 dollars and I'll leave links in the video description below if you guys are interested in these headphones both are Bluetooth version 5.0 which is very important when connecting to the amazon firetv stick or whatever headphones you get make sure they have Bluetooth version 5.0 so I technic headphones have very similar features it has the built-in noise active noise cancellation where blocks out the AC unit in the background just flick that switch the battery life on the I Technic headphones are around 20 hours on the Kohen headphones the battery life is around 30 hours but they're more expensive these also sit around your ear so you have very little audio leakage coming out of the headphones so you don't bother your loved one while they're sleeping and both of these headphones connect to your phone and you can take calls and has a built-in microphone so you can talk in them as well and I technic of course has the same cables to microUSB cable and the audio the audio cable into your headphone jack the settings you want to go over to Bluetooth devices now if you want to connect your headphones to your TV we're not using the Amazon fire TV stick that's a different video I'll leave a link in the video description below how to do that that way you can actually connect to headphones at the same time but your audio latency is going to be a little bit greater because you're connecting to headphones which causes more data transfer now I'm gonna leave a link in the video description below if you're interested in connecting to headphones at the same time to your TV whether you're using Amazon fire TV stick or a cable box it doesn't matter you just need a headphone jack on your TV or audio output on your TV on your Bluetooth devices and I'm gonna go down to other Bluetooth devices first connect the mic Technic headphones it's very easy to do the controls are on the bottom and you just press and hold the power button which is also pause and play button and then wait until the LED turns red and blue Bluetooth and searching right now and picked up my tube and here it is you actually connected the echo show but we're not going to do that that was a different video I made my Technic hit select and now it's pairing all right so now it is connected it's extremely loud the bass on these are amazing I love it let me turn up these lights [Music] we're gonna add Bluetooth device similar controls to the eye technic and your press and hold the power button for a couple seconds maybe five seconds until the LED turned red and blue so the LED is turning red and blue pairing device headset connected now these also have great base active noise cancellation is great blocks out the AC unit so if you're watching TV and your wife is ready to go to bed you could grab your headset turn it on and then switch from the TV volume to your headphones should Auto connect within a few seconds and it does all right and if you want to turn it off it would automatically go to the TV volume there you have it now you know how to connect your headphones to your Amazon fire TV and you also know what headphones work the best on the Amazon fire TV they give you the best movie of TV watching experience and if you guys are interested in any of these products the Amazon fire TV stick or the Bluetooth headphones check out the links in the

10:22:47.365395, now if you're looking for some headphones that are going to be extremely affordable are gonna have like head thumping bass you're gonna want to watch this video oh and by the way they're $55 this is he became an tech reviews and today we're gonna take a look at the sole ultra wireless headphones let's check them out now in this video we're gonna do an unboxing review of the SOL ultra wireless headphones so let's get right to it make sure you hit the subscribe button and tap the little bell icon to get notified when new videos become available now before doing their boxing let's check Sol electronics website so you can see more about the specs so we're looking at a weight of 197 grams so these are gonna be relatively light you're looking at bluetooth 5.0 a three hundred and twenty milliamp hour battery forty millimeter speakers and then 33 foot blue to the range also you do have the ability to take phone calls with these so you have answer pause and and phone call buttons as well as all the expected Bluetooth profiles now 36 hours of battery life is what really excites me about this headphone and then also the audio quality so let's get right to those two points now inside the box you're gonna find your headphones a travel back as well as a microUSB charging cable now taking a closer look at the headphones what you'll see is that you have memory foam on the top memory foam for each earpiece and they are foldable so you can fold them right they have the sole logo on the side see it appears on both sides and then what you have here at the very bottom is you have a micro USB charging cable port pinhole mic headphone you know u.s. standard headphone jack you have your LED indicating that it's on power button and then you can see that you have here your multifunction button as well as your volume rockers now the headphones themselves are pretty straightforward and you can notice that we'll try to put this in an angle there is a right and left ear cup and let's see if we can show that right there so you can see the right logo and the left logo is there and as we put these on you'll notice that they do a really nice job of covering and even when playing music one of the things I'll mention about these is that there's there isn't really much perceived sound leakage coming out of the remember these are 6555 dollars depending on when you look at this video they feel well they don't feel like they're cramping or you know vice in your head and let me turn over to the right here over to the left you can see what that looks like and you know they feel fine on your ear there is no real heat that builds up around your I would say your ears and then also there's no heat buildup that I found at the very top so they're very comfortable to wear I think a lot of this has to do with the lightweight nature of these headphones as we take a look at the audio side of these they do fantastically well for again this price point baseman's and highs are all present but bass is where it's at these have great bass so I listened to several tracks I look at for testing music I look at my track start with audio vocals first and then we introduce the instruments and sometimes even introduce the bass and what I look for is will the bass when it comes in does it overwhelm the vocals or when more than one voice comes in does the other voice that's coming in overwhelmed the vocals as well am I able to hear all the instruments so these had great soundstage for again for this price point had great bass mids highs are present but not as bright as you find in some other headphones but again well balanced now when the bass was introduced one of the things that really impressed me about these is that typically the bass overwhelms all the of their voices or even the instruments that was not the case with this and I'll tell you like the bass is like thumping bass so it does a really nice job there so if you're looking for you know headphones that have great bass but don't overwhelm you know the senses when it comes to your mids and your highs and these are definitely a great deal so guys that wraps up our review of the sole ultra wireless headphones these are a great value have great audio have fantastic battery life and it's something that I highly recommend so go ahead and check them out

vergara|smart watch android|smart watch|smartwatch 2020,2020-10-07 10:22:47.365442, if I were to say the word Montblanc to you what would come to mind probably something in forms of luxury like fashion pens and of course watches but now what if we add to that a pair of high quality headphones it's Joshua Vergara what's going on everybody here's a look at a couple of new products from Mont Blanc including an update to the Mont Blanc summit - yep we're starting off with the mum block summit - plus and this new SmartWatch from the luxury brand brings some needed updates to the wear OS device what we have here is now the Snapdragon wire 3100 processor that comes with its 1 gigabytes of RAM and 8 gigabytes of on-board storage it's of course a Bluetooth connected watch but it also has the ability to connect to phone networks LTE connectivity is available along with calls using the speaker and the microphone built in that battery is a 440 million power battery that will allow for up to three to five days worth of battery life if you turn off key SmartWatch functions but you might want to stay in the main SmartWatch operating system because Mont Blanc is offering a lot in their version of where LS you navigate around it using of course the touch screen but there are a couple of pushers for shortcuts and then you can do a rotating crown which is honestly something that I feel like should be on every SmartWatch moving forward especially where OS devices and this entire casing which comes in at forty three point five millimeters is made of pure steel and is going to be ipx8 rated this luxury SmartWatch does have a number of different configurations that you can put together in order to get a nice combo that fits your style including over a thousand different watch face combinations using the watch face configurator and then you can also put a bunch of different straps on to there as there are plenty of them that I even saw during my short time with it but with all of the different sensors that are built into the summit - plus there are actually extra applications to take advantage of their capabilities and help you in different ways for both travel and fitness and well-being I wasn't really able to show too many of these applications but there are different apps like a travel info app that will give you your local traveler information when you're on the go there's even another app that will help you minimize jet lag in the time-shifter app which will use the information of your upcoming flight details and your current sleep patterns in order to help you that jet lag while you're in a different destination as far as fitness features are concerned this watch is also able to do vo2 max tracking as well as heart rate variability two things that along with heart rate tracking in general are slightly more advanced things to track when it comes to your workouts with all of its capabilities it's great to see that Montblanc is trying to add in features on top of the fact that their high-end watches are of course going to come in at a higher price tag so it's not just for the look it's also for the different capabilities that a watch like this can provide and that will include everything from making calls to having LTE connectivity to all of the tools that are in this wire OS device and all in all it's just a great-looking watch and that's something that you kind of expect from a luxury brand like Mont Blanc but it's one thing that you might not expect is a pair of headphones from a company like this that's right mom Blanc is creating a pair of travel headphones that have some of the DNA of Mont Blanc luxury design all the way down to some metal and steel but also a lot of comfort in the headband and the ear cups themselves I was able to use the Mont Blanc wireless over ear headphones for a little while and I was able to listen to a number of different tracks coming from my own smartphone and I have to say the sound is actually pretty up there when it comes to just pure quality but then the comfort of the actual headphones themselves are what really got me there are a few features that come in really handy if you're an avid traveler not only do you want to have comfort when these are sitting around your neck or up on your head while you're doing the long haul flights and listening to anything that might be coming through those headphones but you also want them to pack down pretty easily so they don't take up too much space in your luggage both are actually covered by Mont Blanc thanks to a combination of leather and of those metal finishes obviously none of the metal will actually touch you when you're wearing the headphones on your head or around your neck so all of the pieces that do touch your skin are really comfortable that's because the leather is also filled with some sort of memory foam which are not only comfortable to the touch but also make enough of a seal so that you are immersed into your audio there are some simple controls not only on the touch sensitive area but also with a couple of buttons that are found on the outer portions of the ear cups including ports for USB C connectivity and charging and also for a headphone jack cable so that you can connect it via an analog connection if you need to even a dedicated button for triggering google assistant but of course what makes these a little bit more high-end in terms of travel headphones is the added active noise cancellation and while there is somewhat stiffer competition these days for anc quality headphones I believe the mum Blanc's are going to be pretty close to the categories of the Sony's and the bows of the world I would have to compare them side-by-side of course but I will say that in the little bit of time that I was using them the ANC did enough to block out the majority of what was going on around me I even found myself just having them on while filming the watch and just enjoying my media from my phone with the ANC awning getting into the zone filming the rest of this video now just like with the Smart Watch I don't have the actual price of these headphones I do expect them to be on the higher end after all Montblanc is a luxury brand I got to say I was really surprised when these headphones were revealed to me at my meeting and I'm actually very impressed that this first attempt by mam Blanca yielded such a memorable experience I do hope to review these products for you very soon so keep it tuned to my channel and subscribe to it if you haven't already drop some likes on this video if you like what I'm doing here and also again to the comment sections and let me know what you think about any of the mam Blanc products I talked about in this piece let me know if you have any mont blanc products yourself whether they are where OS smartwatches they have a few of them already or any of their other luxury items let me know what your experience has been with them in the comments down below as well and with all of that said I'm gonna go ahead and call it on this one thank you so much for watching look forward to even more here on my channel and until my next video I

386,9-fShPZdMqs,Tech Spurt,UCVLN0tY51ewH44wUtx3YZTA,Jaybird Tarah Wireless Sport Headphones Review,"Unboxing and review of Jaybird's new Tarah Wireless Sport Headphones, a pair of in-ear Bluetooth buds connected by a rubber band. Is the Jaybird Tarah one of the best running/gym sports earphones of 2018? We take you on a full tour and give our in-depth impressions after a couple of days of use.

The Jaybird Tarah boasts water and sweat resistance, up to 6 hours of battery life per charge and built-in controls with support for Google Assistant. You can use Jaybird's mobile app for iOS or Android to see how much battery remains, change the audio output, locate your Tarah when it goes walkies and more besides.

Check out our one-month review of the OnePlus Bullets Wireless, a strong rival to the Tarah thanks to its affordable cost and slick design - although it's not as well suited to sports use.

wireless earbuds review,2020-10-07 10:22:47.365538, hello just peeps this is Chris from Tex bird and I'm here with the new it's our Wireless sports headphones up from j-bird hopefully pretty much all the information you need is right there in the title they are fully wireless Bluetooth earphones and they are designed for the more active lifestyle so if you like jump in between rocks in your spare time you know so it's gonna cost you 90 quid they'll be available online from October the 9th and in stores from October 15th I'm just gonna get them fully unbox set them all up using the gia bird mobile app and test them out as well to see if they're actually up to snuff and for more reviews on the latest headphones earphones stuff like that don't forget to hit subscribe and thing that notifications bell Cheers so let's just break into this packaging and the grand and veil there are that our Wireless bought headphones accessories inside yep that's very helpful obviously need all the usual stuff to power them back up because they are of course bluetooth and then behind all that you also get a rather meaty Quick Start Guide Wow look at the size of that it's like worn freaking peace so the actual headphones themselves we'll just stick those aside for a moment and have a full explore them in a second so you also get a proprietary charging dock as well so you need to do is connect to the tower to the dock like so just push it in there nice and firm once that's connected then you just basically plug in the USB bit either into a laptop a USB adapter whatever you have lying around and that should power back up again full charge should take about six hours but partly you can also get a full hours of use from just ten minutes of charge times are pretty handy if you forget to plug them in before pounding the pavement that is actually connected pretty damn tight as well so they certainly shouldn't slip off by accident or anything it's not magnetic connection unfortunately it is basically just clips in there and that's that's held tight at least so that's the main thing as you can see there the towers do of course bought a soft silicone in earbud and you actually get a spare set right here in the box as well so no matter what your ear size and ship you can get a different set connected and hopefully provide a nice comfortable fit they snap off nice and easy just basically give them a bit of a tug off they come as you can see there the inner bits exposed then all you need to do is find another one and snap it on there there's a nice little sticky a bit to help keep it in place so just slip that over there and that will hold it nice and firm as you can see there the cord can actually be adjusted on the flight as well so you can make it shorter longer whatever you fancy to get a nice comfortable fit you also get a bit of clip action as well if you just want to clip it to your clothing just to make sure it's not flying about the place I just slips onto the cable like so and then you're basically good to go as you see there you've got a little control panel actually attached to the tower wireless spot headphones as well so you've got control over the volume you can also pause and play your media and apparently can be used to answer calls and there's also a full support for Google assistant in there too designs pretty straightforward by the looks of it nor particular frills or anything like that it's all about obviously the comfort the fact that is a fully water resistant as well it's ipx7 so you can give them a full on Duncan in some water you actually wear them while you're swimming if you want to and it's pretty sweat resistant as well good news if you were you sweat up a storm like I do with any amount of activity you can grab it in black and gray or blue and it certainly so far just from an initial test seems pretty durable that nice flexi rubber cable shouldnt get all tied up or twisted or anything like that and hopefully should be able to take a good bit of punishment as well now as mentioned there is actually a gia boat app available to sync up with your headphones as well and that's available for either iOS or Android first up we just need to actually pair them a to the smartphone of course that's dive into the bluetooth effort and then if we hold down the power button here on the gia bird taras there we go we've got a little light flashing on as you can see it just pops straight up in the devices and then pair and complete nice and easy that's what we like dive on back into the gia bird app you can see it's busy connecting now to our Terra's connected hooray I like it when stuff just works so what this allows you to do is basically customize the audio output from the G over terra's all the ways you can choose from various presets as well if you're feeling a bit more lazy diving on into the music section it looks like you can actually stream some tunes island beats cardio live hypernym of course you can you just use your standard Spotify playlists if you'd rather do that you could also share your presets and everything or with the world if you want to and then you can check out a little bit more about your headphones as you see there there's also a fine my buds option as well so let's turn that on and then this will actually show you where your buds are currently looking at it presumably only if they're actually turned on and everything of course all right so I've been using gia birds for a couple of days now full on use and so far definitely liking them the silicone gels provide a nice comfortable fit the fact you've got different sizes as well means you can find the ones that are just right for your lug holes and then when you slip them in there it's getting nice and easy to slide straight in it's a nice snug fit so you can be a running pounding the pavement as fast as you like and they will stay in there there's no sign of slippage or anything even when you're getting a wee bit sweaty I have found however that because you've got this control block here over on the right hand side they do contendere get dragged over to the right a bit as you are moving around which kind of tugs a little bit on your left earlobe and it's particularly annoying if you're trying to then look over your right shoulder it just then pause a little bit and provides a bit of resistance not to the point where I'll ever risk popping out or anything just it's just kind of a little bit irritating so definitely recommend using the bundled clip which I showed you earlier just clip it onto the back of your collar if possible and that'll just help to prevent that from happening and I've got to admit I did miss the magnetic connection of the Wampus but as well especially handy when you're not using them these things we can just slip off quite easily whereas the one place you just stick them together like that they magnetically connect and I see forms are kind of weird necklace no problem with it slipping off at all those controls work absolutely fine they're nice and easy to locate and you've got usual volume controls and nice and intuitive volume up at the top volume down down below you can also skip tracks as well a few long press them so that's pretty handy if you're doing a bit of a play list some it comes on you don't really feel in the mood for as for the battery life I have found that between five and six hours of use per full charge is basically spot-on they give you a little update of roughly how much battery life is remaining when you turn them on you do actually get a proper precise readout of exactly how much about your life it is remain and within that jaybird app which is definitely very handy and as promised you can pile them up pretty quickly as well just ten minutes of the plug and you will get a full hour of use out of them no problems and good news if you can just kind of on a quick jog and session and you forgot to charge them as for the sound quality I see the towers are pretty respectable in that front as well probably quite similar I guess to the one-plus bullets vocals come across nice and crisp and it's only the sort of heavier rock tracks things like that where things get a little bit muddled especially on higher volume but in terms of the volume as well absolutely no problem they're strong powerful output when you bump them right up that's a good news if you're a wee bit deaf like me and that in a nutshell is the dear bird Tara wireless sports buds definitely do the job for anyone who does a lot of runnin hits the gym quite frequently and just want something to listen to their tracks for decent quality its nightly quid not the cheapest as well you can't get the lights the oneplus Wireless buds for cheaper than that so definitely let us know what you think in the comments down below and thanks for watching everyone don't forget to hit subscribe for more on the latest and greatest tech Cheers [Music]

going to help you decide whether the Edifier w 830 bt wireless headphones are worth buying now first of all before I show you the actual product I really like the packaging on this one very understated packaging I come from a graphic design background and I love the fact that this box is matte and then they've done this like gloss varnish just to the headphones on the box simple thing but I just really like it the box also details some of the features on these headphones including up to 60 days of standby time and up to 95 hours of music playback from a single charge that is pretty impressive now before I show you the headphones and talk to you about the quality just want to let you know that this is a live broadcast so if you do want to use the live chat then please do if you want to use the super chat that will highlight your comment and if you're watching this after the live broadcast please do leave me some comments or questions down below answer pretty much all of them and if you can subscribe to the geeky noise channel I'd really appreciate it hit that subscription button and also click on the notification bill because then you'll be notified when I either do a live broadcast or when I upload one of my regular videos so anyway what else do we get inside the box where we get the headphones themselves which are supplied inside this really nice pouch you also get a USB charging cable you also get a three-and-a-half millimeter audio cable as well you can use these wired as well as Wireless now they're made some bold claims about battery life and I'll talk to you about that a little bit later on but let's take a look inside this pouch it's like a zip pouch very very nice it's got Earths or rigid top and bottom to it and then in this top section we've got a little netting sort of pocket to keep your cables in and then the bottom section obviously houses the headphones themselves and when you take these out I think they're really nice or understated sort of look very very nice indeed a combination of blacks and then around on the ear cups here we got this sort of gunmetal grey type color very very nice coloring to these I do like it a lot let's talk about comfort factor first of all nice padding across the headband we've got some Eddy fire branding across here as well and then on the actual ear cups and these do fold flat let's go into the case which is really nice but on these a really nice amount of padding on here as well I'm pretty sure don't quote me on this it it feels like memory foam but just a really nice amount of padding and a nicer sort of layer of material over the top as well don't think this is leather I think it sort of ass or an artificial type material but a really nice quality of padding very very comfy and they're quite a nice lightweight pair of headphones so I don't think you have any problem at all wearing these for prolonged periods of time we've also got adjustment on the size sides with this ratchet mechanism and wearing them they're sort of over ear design but not massive they're just the right size for my ears and they feel very very comfortable I really do think they feel nice and comfy now if we look at the actual controls on the ear cups let's fold this round so we can get a better look so on this one here we've got the three-and-a-half millimeter audio jack and we've also got an NFC contact point on this ear cup as well so that means you can connect them nice and easily if your smartphone's got NFC we've also got a little rubber cover and underneath that rubber cover is the micro USB charging point now this is the only negative I found with these so far this seemed this little rubber cover comes out sometimes a time it's a little bit loose I would have liked it with to being a bit sort of a tighter fit if you push it down in there you can get it to sort of stay in but that's just one of those very very minor things I picked up on then on this one here we've got a little tiny pinhole microphone we've also got a little push button in the middle which is like a multi-function button and then volume up and down so you've got full control on this earcup here so if a call comes in you can obviously take that call and then your music will resume after you've stopped speaking adjustment wise we've obviously got some rotation on this axis we've also got the ear cups moving on this axis means you get a nice comfortable fit charging very very good as well very not quick charge but a very good charging time and the claims of up to I think 60 days is it yeah up to sixty days standby well I can't comment on that cuz I haven't had them sixty days but going back on the claim of up to 95 hours of playback time I've had roughly I would say about forty to fifty hours of use and still haven't had to charge them which is good by itself I mean come on that is absolutely fantastic I don't think you'll have any issue at all with battery life on these and if they live up to this 95 hours of music playback time which are pretty sure they will go in judging on it so far then that's gotta be one of the best performance battery life in a pair of headphones I've tested to date now we talk about the actual audio quality in a very short while before I do so let me just remind you that you can also find me on Twitter on Facebook and on Instagram if you search geek annoyed on all of those platforms you can find me please do follow along especially on Twitter I tweet a lot so follow me on Twitter as well I've also got the at geek discounts account on Twitter so if you're into buying technology and you want to save a little bit then please do check out that Twitter as well so back to the Edifier headphones the w8 30 BT part from the really good battery life apart from the comfort factor how do they sound that's very very important bass extension on these very good I think the frequency response is 20 Hertz to 20,000 Hertz so very very good bass frequencies not the lowest of bass frequencies all the most controlled lower frequencies I've heard in a pair of headphones very very bass heavy tracks sometimes sound a little sort of mushy little bits all compressed but not too bad at all a very good performance especially at this price point which are come on through in a short while mid-range vocals sound nice and natural little tiny bit of colorization these have got their own sort characteristics but again a very convincing sort of vocal performance in all different genres of music and the higher frequencies I don't think you have any complaint about at all they don't sound clinical at all just nice amount of detail don't sound tinny and they just sound really nice very very nice with the higher frequencies and the overall sound signature is very pleasing and when I looked at the price of these I was amazed excuse me very very impressed with the price check out the current price and I don't normally mention pricing in my videos because it changes so often but if you check out the links down in the video description then you'll find the current pricing to these there's also a link to the Edifier website so if you want a decent pair of wireless headphones that you can also use wide with amazing battery life then check these out thank you very much for watching don't forget to hit that like button and subscribe a course and are sealed in another video very soon"

But hey, I'm just writing this down so that it says something down here, because that's more professional right?) and if you're still reading along at this point you might as well sit down and grab some popcorn because this is about to trail on about how we are this premiere repair service located in Washington State North of Seattle in basically the ""Armpit of the US"" near Mt Baker (Mt Baker has the world record for most snowfall at 1,140 inches in a season). Even though it can smell bad around here we love the fresh air and being near the post office and in a quiet sleepy mountain town certainly gives us much closer access to Team Turtle and Team Beaver (Watch our ""Who, what, when and where is JoesGE?"" video if you don't get the reference). 
All this to basically say that we are all addicted to coffee and stay in the warehouse for ridiculously long hours in order to keep up with the demands of the youth for these two-sided head audio devices and speakers that float when you throw them in the ocean or in your bathtub to test if they actually float. On top of that, we do like it when less stuff ends up in landfills so we hoard everything on shelves with wheels so that we pollute less, it just sits in our warehouse losing molecules slowly over time degrading to become smaller and smaller. 

If you are still reading at this point you deserve an award, or a high five, or something because you must either be the most patient person on the planet, or you read blogs frequently. And if the latter is the case, then this whole thing must seem pretty short so let's keep going. 
We do some really interesting things here at JoesGE which are frequently documented in our sometimes weekly sometimes never vlogs. 
Also, if you are wondering how we keep up with the demands of the people so well, its because 90% of the people that work here are all Russian around getting things done most of the time. Yes, that was a pun, you are welcome. We hope you have a pun-filled day, because who couldn't use a few laughs?",28,24035,131.0,244.0,16.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_nqVFdFo2EI/hqdefault.jpg,Beats|Sony|Bose|headphones repair service|broken power issue not working|center|Washington|New|York|California|joesge|gaming|and|electronics|headphones|JBL|Bragi|Apple|UE|Logitech|Fitbit|Samsung|broken|remote|non|authentic|false|knockoff|real|canon|nikon|camera|lens|service|help|hook|review|test|determine|HK|Tutorial|Earbuds|iFixit|Inear|google|Beats Solo 3 Wireless|Solo 3 wireless dies fast|Beats Solo 3 Wireless battery replacement|fix my beats,2020-10-07 10:22:47.365628, hey guys this is David with Joe's gaming and electronics here with the beat sold three Wireless repair video today I'll be showing you how to replace the battery all parts of tools that will be used in this video are available on our website linked below so let's get into it first thing I'm going to have to do so grab your pry tool it's a tool we use and pry open this right outside panel starting on starting right here kind of go along the edge of the circle part of the panel once you got this part kind of pulled up you can go ahead and start prying up the side here along the hinge all right now we have X to the battery there's a power board where the battery clips in we can go ahead and remove the old battery so first you want unplug it and now you can use a pry tool and pry this up so it's held by a piece of tape all you need to do is shove your pry tool right underneath in it kind of pry it up just like that grab your new battery and plug it in let's plug it in you can go ahead and place the battery back in its slot weights it kind of fold these wires back down and finally place the hinge on the outside panel just like that flip it over and first thing I like to do is clip clip in one side of the panel right here flip that in flip this over and now you can just pinch this into place but pull the hinge a few times make sure it's not it doesn't get stuck or anything and now we can go ahead and clip in the rest of this panel make sure your hinge so it's nicely and that is it if you guys have any questions regarding this repair comment in the comment section below and we'll do our best to reply to your comments please like and subscribe to our YouTube channel thanks for watching have a great day

10:22:47.365671, alright guys so the embargo has been lifted and everybody today audio-wise is probably going to be talking about the drop thx pandas now this is a pair of bluetooth headphones that is a collaboration between drop and thx which to me looks like a modern wireless version of the Oppo PM threes they have some pretty impressive technology I'm gonna do this video a little bit differently because I really want to talk about what is making me gravitate towards using these why I keep picking these up over some of my other headphones and why I think these are pretty special at 400 bucks now first off $400 is a lot of money but if you consider the technology that's in these because these do have plane are driven drivers they're using a Qualcomm 51:24 chip which allows for apdex l DAC apdex adaptive apdex HD AACSB c pretty much all of the high-end bluetooth codecs you could possibly think of these are capable playing this is a pre-release version so this one is actually handmade although the official release version is going to be you know factory made so you know take that with a grain of salt considering I don't know how that quality is gonna hold up compared to these which I'm sure somebody paid very specific details to making sure everything was right but I think this is an excellent pair of headphones I've enjoyed the hell out of using them and I've been excited to be able to tell you guys about them but I couldn't talk about them until today because today is the day that they start pre-ordering these which all of that information will be in the description below so first off what are these headphones well this again is a collaboration between drop and thx which thx is a company you usually associate with movies because George Lucas came out with this to bring out better detail in the audio because he felt like things were missing in Star Wars he had subtle sounds that when it's projected in the theater he felt like that just wasn't being brought out so thx was designed to be able to bring out those details focus a lot more on audio and so these have a thx triple-a amplifier built in so one of the first things that I noticed when I got the box is the packaging's pretty simple like there's no logos I mean other than it's saying drop in thx on the outside of the box then when you slide that open it's just a simple spiral design there's no information there's no details it's just a plain box with a plain looking pair of headphones inside so there's nothing to get excited about just simply by looking at these now you can tell inside the box there's a slot where there would normally be instructions mine didn't come with any it just came with the headphone case which is a fairly large case but it's a nice hard case but it also has a compartment inside that houses the headphone cable because you are able to use these wired now I will say if you're going to use these wired I highly recommend plugging these into an amp because that really is the best way to get the most out of these so the headphones themselves are pretty plain Jane it don't look like anything special it's just solid black there's not a lot of controls there's no fancy touch controls in fact the way that they did the controls on these I liked a lot they're basically using this little joystick on the back there's only one button so that one button allows you to play pause skip your track forward go backwards turn the volume up turn the volume down everything is right there on that one button and I love the sound effect that it has when the headphones turn on and when they shut off it really reminds me of like an 80s arcade machine so having that little nostalgia just by turning these things on it just sounds really cool now the headphones himself the first thing I noticed was the headband does not have a lot of padding now the headphones are not necessarily lightweight so I thought that maybe this was going to be an issue but the silicone van that they used underneath provided plenty of padding this was a pair I was able to wear for a long period of time I guess the weight was just distributed evenly and it never got uncomfortable now the top of the headband is plastic and for me it would be something to baby be slightly concerned about just because build quality wise whenever I see plastic on a headband especially a pair that I'm gonna spend $400 on I would be worried that this might snap now the way that you adjust these the aluminum that's down here just simply slides into the headband and it wraps down to connect to the headphones now the ear on the outside of the ear cups these are also plastic but without these having so many parts on the outside and without these having the ability to fold inward there's not a whole lot of parts that you have to worry about now as far as swiveling they do swivel inwards so that if you have them and you take them off your head you can swivel them down and they will lay right there instead of just sticking straight up the ear cups on these our foam ear cups wrapped in a protein leather now these are extremely soft there's a lot of give to these and the ear cups are fairly deep so my ears are not hitting the inside of the ear cups which is where you can see your left and right or marked the drivers that are in here are unique I haven't seen these in a lot of other headphones you don't really see a lot of playing our ribbon drivers so I was very curious to how well that thx amplifier is gonna be able to amplify them and I can say that these get plenty loud and I never heard any distortion which was really impressive considering that was just on Bluetooth as far as your inputs go it's pretty simple on the left hand side you do have your three-and-a-half millimeter input for that headphone cable on the right hand side you have the USB C input for charging battery life on these you're going to get around 30 hours on a single charge but if you do happen to pick them up and they're dead a quick 10 minute charge is going to get you three hours of use now that comes in handy because I'm one of those that's the worse for making sure that all of my headphones are charged so you know being able to pick them up charge them for ten minutes and get three hours of use is always welcomed now as far as the microphones on here it says that it has dual microphones all the microphones that I see are on the right hand side but I see slots for three so I'm not sure really if that's just kind of messing around with placement or how that works but I will still give you guys a sample of the mic test so that you can be a judge here alright guys so here is a test of the microphones on the drop pandas this is just to give you an idea of what it would sound if you were to take a call now let's get over to the sound because for $400 even though I think that's very inexpensive for this type of technology in these type of drivers in a Bluetooth pair of headphones $400 is still a lot of money for a lot of people and the initial thing is people are gonna want to you know compare these to the Bose 700 or the Sony 1000 XM 3s and I'm here to say you probably shouldn't because this is not that kind of headphone these do not have noise canceling technology at all which I feel like with the Sony and the Bose whenever you switch over to noise cancelling you can tell that that technology is doing something to the audio like it's altering it it's changing it it usually warms it up a little bit or adds a little bit more thump in the bass where with these you're going to get the same sound on Bluetooth at all times like it doesn't matter there's no EQ settings which I really would have liked to have seen and I'll explain that a little bit more in a second because this overall is a very warm sounding pair of headphones I felt like the detail and the mids and the highs were extremely great I think these are very detailed but something about the bass not having that overpowering boom or punch to them just kind of added a warm layer to it now I'm not saying that these don't have bass at all they have plenty of bass and plenty of thump to them but it's not overpowering like a lot of bluetooth headphones are so that was one of my concerns when I saw that it had amplification at all I felt that these were gonna be very boosted I was a little concerned that there was gonna be distortion and you know simply put that just didn't happen now I'm not saying that these sound like a studio pair of headphones although you can get that sound if you're using these wires I think the best way to explain these is you have basically two completely different pair of headphones into one because if you're using them Bluetooth you're going to get a certain type of sound but if you're gonna run these wired and you're gonna run these into an amp you can get a completely different type of sound and I felt like using these wired open these up a lot more it brought out a little more detail and it added a little more thump in the base where I felt like using these with Bluetooth the bass couldn't reach its full potential you know it didn't have that impact like a lot of other headphones and a lot of people are gonna prefer this sound and overall again I think this adds to these sounding is natural as they do because the mid sound fantastic the mids never got lost in the bass it never got lost in the other instruments that were going on I think these did an excellent job of separating the instruments I think these did a great job with the detail and the sound the treble sounded nice and clean but it didn't sound anywhere near harsh so it didn't sound like they were trying to boost these too much and I personally think that what they were going for is a very nice natural warm tone as far as the soundstage and the sound imaging like I said it does an excellent job with detail of instruments I don't feel like these sound as open as I thought they would and maybe that's because having these type of drivers I'm used to kind of hearing and open-back headphones so I'm used to a more open feel now this does feel like you're in a larger room but I guess I was kind of expecting that concert hall sound and it didn't fit that so although I think these are an excellent pair of headphones I do have a few cons this might be nitpicking but I really wish that these folded down just to have you know a smaller footprint if you want to throw them into a bag I think with the amplification it would have been nice to have had some app support so that you can EQ these a little bit now I know that you can have your own app within your phone but if there was an app that was geared more specifically towards the headphones himself it would just feel like maybe you can tune them a little more because everybody is taste and listening to music or movies or whatever it's different so to be able to have that control is just nice but outside of that I think this looks like a very clean polished product that you're getting like superior audio compared to a lot of other Bluetooth headphones in a price range that's competing directly with some of the more consumer-friendly type Bluetooth headphones this right here in my opinion destroys the bows and the Sony's but it is a completely different listening experience and this isn't a pair that I would if it's something you're trying to block out like your surroundings or airplane noise or stuff like that it just simply doesn't do that so overall my experience with these has been just nothing but Pleasant I have loved picking these up and I've reached for these more than I've reached for any other pair of headphones in the time that I've had them in fact I have to send these back and I'm pretty sad that I have to do that but I am gonna be one of those that backs these because I really want to just listen to these more but guys that's my video on the brand new drop THX panda bluetooth headphones I absolutely love them I highly recommend them and if you want any more information like I said there will be a link below in the description but guys thank you so much for checking out this video thank you so much for checking out all the other videos and as always make sure to stay tuned for more

10:22:47.365737, these are the Aurora wireless Bluetooth headphones [Music] [Applause] [Music] so why frogs have sent over the aurora wireless headphones these are a good-looking set of over ear headphones that come in a variety of different colors on our attractively priced at 35 Pines down the side we can see that they've got an ergonomic fit vibrant sind 40 millimeter drivers all near controls up to 40 hours of battery life and era foam ear cushions so it's a rather attractive package of anything and it might be quite cool for the kids you know you can see the rather striking design it's all one color obviously and that reiterates all those features on the back here pointing out where exactly to find them okay so the ergonomic bluetooth headphones with own ear controls yeah alright there's not too much more on the box other than all those features again so let's get it out and have a look at the quality of them at 35 Pines I'm not expecting too much because obviously they've they've got an awful lot in design and things like that but right from the word go outside of the box we get we get a 3.5 millimeter headphone cable to pull on one side 3 pull on the other looks fairly standard probably as a part of a couple of feet long then we have a USB charging cable which is micro USB to regular USB very short here we have a quick start guide as to how to use the buttons there we go so volume up volume down track forward and backward button play pause in the middle taking calls pressed play music power to power up power impaired quite difficult to see through the viewfinder here sorry to turn your roars higher headphones on press and hold the large button yeah we'll come to that alright so their headphones themselves well here they are they're really light exceptionally light in fact plastic the whole way around faux leather for the ear pieces and on here we have the side which is quite shiny and good-looking to be honest volume up down left and right and then a clicky power button then we have the USB or micro USB connector here that looks to be an LED there and a microfilm there another than that it's fairly simple around here there's not much in the way of adjustment but I suppose whenever you've got two of them acting together that gives you a good couple of inches to encompass the larger heads but I can't imagine too many large headed people using these or older people using these for that matter and here we have right it's all plastic construction in here a couple of metal screws and then a foam bumper to make it comfortable on the head left on this side there's no wiggle um so you this is what you're gonna have to stick on your head no matter what there's no adjustment laughter right then here there is actually a bit of a pattern here it's not for gripper and things just basic design that doesn't do anything this doesn't do anything and we have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack there so if your batteries died and you've remembered to bring a 3.5 millimeter headphone connector then you can have a go so I'm gonna slip them on and see how they go so right to that side so over this way around and they are exceptionally light they really are on that on the ear they don't press in too much around here that I can imagine these being very comfortable on a long road trip if you have if you're having to deal with one so we'll turn them on and pair them up I heard a little voice they're saying something our phone has detected them already connected it said and we'll have a we listen to some tracks okay so listening through a couple of tracks there they're a wee bit tinny there's not much in the way of BS they feel very very light I would actually recommend using them maybe more so for podcasts than for heavy tunes I listen to quite a bit of rock and punk music and they just didn't quite cut it however they're 35 pint headphones so I wasn't expecting that much for to get a better sound quality at that's price you're probably better off going with some form of in-ear headphones because these lose quite a bit what I'll do is I'm gonna bring up one of the podcasts so I can play that music and I'll hold this up to our microphone here so you can get an idea of the tennis it's the fourth of October and this is tech Alex this week we're talking about Google pixels pixel to pixel to excel the whole mini the whole max the pixel book and the big daydream okay so hopefully that gives you a bit of an idea of what to expect from these to be honest I think they're all about design and for that they look pretty damn good there they are a gorgeous looking pair of headphones and you could do far worse for your money but at the same time you could do a lot better there's there's plenty of other thirty to forty pint headphones out there of a different nature these are over the head headphones so they might work rather well with the microphone and I suppose I could maybe try a call or two but I'll have to report back to let you know how well the microphone operates in calls and that sort of thing where maybe wearing them around the house to take phone calls but that's doesn't really look like what they were planned for so doing a little bit of research to see if I can find out exactly how long the battery would might last or what size the battery is which doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere in the website or in the documentation I have noticed that it says here that it has a 13 millimeter driver inside on the website as opposed to 40 millimeters than it brags on the box hopefully it's just a typo on the website we're going to throw these at depaul for him to review and let us know what he thinks of it in all honesty alright cool thanks for watching

and the main button and then there's a microUSB cable connector there with a cover to allow the person to keep it somewhat sweat-resistant or a little extra bit of water if it were to hit you because there is no IP rating on these I don't believe no there is no way I mention all waterproof or water resistance at all anywhere in and the microphone I am wondering if though you know that's supposed to be up like that so your nail can catch it quite easily okay simple simple and then some hyzer on the bottom and then up to the other earbud which is exactly the same as the one the other side I guess you can only put these into your ear one way so this would be the right yes that's the right because putting it into the left means that this comes out and goes backward on itself which is quite uncomfortable so you're not gonna get them the wrong way wrong then it feels natural to push that in like that yeah so that's your right and oddly enough this is your left okay I'm gonna have a go at testing these to see how well they work and I have an idea I'm not sure how well it's gonna work but oh I'll give it a go okay so a sec effectively my idea is to take this time microphone which I'm talking into now and hold it up to the headphone as there is a podcast playing that podcast from the tech addicts crew has some pretty swell music which is similar to the music at the opening of this video and a little bit of spoken word so will give you a better idea of how well this sign so obviously these are not burned in or anything they're straight out of the box but can get a bisque idea of how well the signed signs so we'll do that now it's the 8th of November and this is tech addicts this week Ricky's got a new iPhone he also has a new Xbox one axe razor phones be launched I got a Ritter from teammate only identify for phones you could buy for the price one thing that we haven't done yet is to test the magnetic bottoms okay so it does it clicks together much like this isn't that fantastic all right so if you have any questions let me know in the comments below check back on tech Alex dot uk' for other reviews and videos for headphones and under like hit that subscribe button turn on notifications and other than that take care [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

editiion,2020-10-07 10:22:47.365784, [Music] everybody loves apples new beats solo three wireless headphones the only thing that makes them better is the special edition Mickey's 90th anniversary version that comes with a bunch of accessories to go along with it and a really unique design these have been out for a little while now but we finally just got our hands on some and we're really excited to show them off so if you haven't seen them this is your chance you see what you get inside compared to going for just the stock beats solo three Wireless out of the gate the attention to detail is insane there are so many little touches that really make these headphones above really most of the other ones you're ever gonna find on the market even inside the back of the top of the box there's little imprints of Disney going around the edges it is very very cool you're greeted at first by that Disney pin which we're gonna come back to which below you'll find the canvas bag that is actually going to hold your headphones it's not canvas more like a wool type bag to hold the headphones and then underneath all of that a few getting started guides and paperwork carabiner clip and audio cord for taking phone calls and controlling music and the power cord itself so back to that pain that you saw right when you open it up the special 90s 90th anniversary Disney pin even the back of this has the little Mickey ears on it it is metal and then you got the beats logo and the Disney Mickey logo there on the bottom right if anyone who collects pins this is just a cool thing a cool little thing to be included in the box attach it to the side headphones or wherever you want to save it now we don't need to go through all these getting started guides it's a lot of what you would come to expect from the beats solo degree because basically how to get these things up and going but what is really cool is you also get a beats sticker the same thing as the pin button sticker form so apples always done this beats has done this you get beats het stickers in the box apple sticker in the box same thing here but now we're getting that ninetieth Mickey anniversary sticker so another cool little touch that gets included with these headphones so the two cables that you got with this thing the first cable that is included is the power cable so you use these things to charge everything up unfortunately compared to some of Apple's other more recent headphones these things still charge via microUSB so you still got to keep this around if you're an Apple user you're not necessarily going to have one of these cables in your rotation you often have lightning cables maybe some USB see looking towards the future but if you pick these up you still need to have a microUSB cable as far as powering these up they charge super quick you can actually get three hours of use out of them after only a five minute charge and then of course we have an audio cable that you can plug into there plug into the bottom of your phone assuming you have an adapter on one of the newer ones or playing to your computer and you can use it to take calls and there's an inline controller set as well you can use to control the music though there are controls on the headphones themselves but you can use this wired if you'd prefer rather than wirelessly so back to the headphones beats headphones often contain these little carrying pouch is we have another one here that's very unique to these with that Disney and beats logo right there on the front it's kind of like a marina wool very soft feeling to it and it's going to protect those headphones whenever they're thrown into your bag carabiner clip can also be attached to the end of it to clip on to the side of a bag and Apple did include that in the box so these are the headphones themselves they look pretty awesome a bunch of Disney Mickey Mouse caricatures going around the edges they kind of move on to the cups just a little bit a lot of really premium materials that we've seen though they are still plastic which I note some people had problems with plastic level on the beats headphones but these are pretty awesome headphones and they have the same specs as a standard beats solo three Wireless on this left hand cup here you can see we can play pause in the center as well as change the volume up and down by pressing on the actual cup itself and on the right hand side is where you'll find the actual power button to turn it on and on either cup there is either the headphone jack on this left hand side and on the right hand side you'll find the micro USB port to actually charge them what makes these headphones pretty amazing compared to most headphones on the market and not just their Disney and aspect they're mickey aspect is east ed apples w1 chip inside which makes for an unbelievable experience they pair effortlessly to your iPhone your iPad your Mac your Apple watch it actually goes to one device and then they're available on all of your devices so as you switch between them it's really really easy to make sure your headphones are kind of following you depending on which device that you're using you can use standard Bluetooth but using the W one you get like a hundred foot range and a bunch of other benefits sound quality still it's beats so it's going to be on the high end but it's not going to be comparable as some of the really upper echelon you're still paying for more of the brand it so has a little bit of extra base but audio quality has come a long way from where the beats brand used to be if you want to pick these up they're really amazing you'll find the link below in the description and I want to hear your thoughts down below in the comments [Music] [Applause]

398,oQxLxN3_IoQ,SmackumApp,UCvMQpqdo9kC42u7h2Ii0aFw,How to make wireless headphones using an iPod  shuffle and velcro,"If you jog or ride a bike these days, most people listen to music. The arm bands that hold iPods work fine, but the wire running from the device to your head can get hung up on a door knob and hook you like a fish. 

My knees suck so I ride bikes rather than run. I wear a head rag, helmet, glasses and headphones. When you plug in from the bicep it is cool, but I prefer to be wireless. Using an old iPod shuffle (e-Bay $25), behind-the-ear headphones (Walmart $15) and one piece of velcro you can do it.  

I don't want to look like some guy wrapping a radio to my head with rubber bands. This method does not look geeky, it is barely noticeable under your helmet. You have access to forward music, or take off the whole unit without getting hung up. 

Here is a video showing exactly what to do.",28,20343,10.0,30.0,43.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oQxLxN3_IoQ/hqdefault.jpg,iPod shuffle|earphones with velcro|wireless iPod headphones|bicycle ipod headphones,2020-10-07 10:22:47.365826,

Recently I got my hands on Skullcandy uproar wireless Bluetooth headphones thanks to my friend Sanjeev. 
Other GREAT alternative to these headphones - https://youtu.be/EJn1_h6Km4g 

I used it for few days and came to few conclusions. These headphones are not comfortable and if I bought them at their MRP in India, I would certainly feel looted. However there are many ongoing deals on it which keep running on Amazon and flipkart. However, size and comfort is subjective and can vary head to head. 

Their battery backup is good and the sound is just around average. 

However, You would find their best price at Amazon US and there they cost around 25-35 USD which in my opinion is a great price for these bluetooth headphones. 

Let me know your thoughts on it.

So a friend of mine let me borrow his Skullcandy uproar wireless headphones. So when I first listened to these headphones and I saw the MRP which clearly says rupees 5499, that is about almost 80 US dollars, I felt that these are very very overpriced for the kind of quality of the sound they produce, for the quality of the materials used in the headphones and for the comfort. So there's a volume up volume down key the same buttons also skip tracks. The middle button is the power button and you also need to hold this while you are pairing it with your device for the very first time. So definitely these cushions could have used some work, they could have been more Comfortable. These are clearly and very easily on-ear headphones not over-ear Headphones. I have no idea why they tried to put these cushions on top of the Headphone, it’s quite small and quite thin to give any sort of comfort to any head whatsoever. I could be wrong you could have a soft head and it serves the purpose to you. Of course I have a hard head. One thing I noticed is that as you can see the wire is clearly visible right on the plastic part so I would say for the wire it's not quite a safe proposition and you need to be very careful when you pack these headphones in your bag or just throw them around because these wires can easily cut off. These are not heavy headphones at all. The build quality does feel cheap but I think if the materials of the plastic used on these headphones are good then they can really last you long. What I've read on some reviews online that people do say that they are very reliable and they have lasted a very long time for them so if I believe in those customer reviews I would start to feel that yes this light plastic is really of good quality but only time can tell that. So out of the box you get a micro USB charging cable and a headphones. that's it. A user manual and stuff like that. So I mostly listen to trance on these which is the primary genre of music which I listen to. I felt the sound is quite balanced, the bass is decent if I push myself into believing that these headphones should really cost around 25 to 30 USD dollars then I would truly enjoy the sound but if Skullcandy tries to sell these to me for 80 US dollars which is almost rupees 5500 in Indian currency then I would truly hate these headphones. The primary reason for hating these headphones won't be the sound but the comfort they provide. The plastic, if it is of really good quality or not ,only time can tell that but apart from these things what I can immediately check is the quality of the sound and the comfort. The quality of sound is just just above average for 25 to 30 US dollars headphones bluetooth headphones, but the comfort on my head, they were not comfortable at all. So as some of you may know that I have a big head....a big head. These were truly uncomfortable for me. I couldn't wear them more than let's say 30 minutes or so without taking them off, taking a little break and then again putting them back on. One more thing I noticed that these headphones do not have a very high volume when I reached the maximum volume level both on my phone and on the headphones. It's not bad, it's not very low but but it is a thing which is good to know. These headphones claim they have 40mm drivers and I believe so and I think apart from the 40mm driver inside of it there is nothing else. About the battery life the battery can easily last you for a day and even more than that if you are not a crazy maniac and you use your headphones for 15 hours straight. The charging time is around 3 to 4 hours which is quite fine for the backup it's providing. If you want to see more reviews on Bluetooth headphones let me know in the comment section and do subscribe to my channel because it motivates me a lot for making videos past midnight. So if you are getting these headphones under some deals some amazing deals like how I saw an Amazon US for 25 to 30 US dollar so you can definitely purchase these headphones but do not purchase them at their maximum retail price that is for sure these are these are not worth that price at all and if you notice these headphones were made in China. So is everything else. Except for Apple flagship phones now they are being made in India. So I would say these headphones have a balanced sound, the bass is decent the clarity is fine but do not expect anything exceptional from these headphones. They are just another average headphones which are there out in the market to please you if you just wanted a branded bluetooth headphone. So I think skullcandy here did try to charge you a lot for a headphones which could have easily costed half of its MRP, which is Indian rupees 5500 and round about 80 US dollars. But when I looked at some deals on the same headphones on Amazon US, I noticed that these went as low as 25 US dollars and believe me for that much amount of money even for 30 US dollars, these are really good headphones provided that you don't have a huge head. So you are going to be fairly pleased with these headphones if you bought them at a good price. If you paid anything around 60 or 70 USD or above you will feel you have been cheated. So I think this video is supposed to be a responsible video and make you a smart consumer. Well hit that subscribe button then. I did not mean to roast these headphones in this video but I thought to add some humor and I hope you like it. That's all for today. MuBot out. The skull here on the headphones signify that they belong to SkullCandy Company.. ..What am I saying.."

headphones now quick back story just about five years ago I made a really cringey video about my favorite headphones at the time which were the audio technica ath em 50s like the original ones the ones with the cable so long that I had to tie an elastic band around them to keep them from falling everywhere now I love those headphones I tried so many other ones in the past and couldn't find anything that sounded really really good for the price and then I ended up finding mkbhd video at the time and then I saw his video bought a used pair and never went back to any other headphones they just sounded so good and I ended up keeping that exact pair until late last year and I beat the crap out of those things using them every single day throwing them in and out of my bag but ever since switching to my essential phone I noticed that I put away my corded headphones in favor of my Jaybirds X twos but something never felt quite right I always missed having that crispy audio quality and the tight punchy bass so I began my hunt and that brings us to today since I liked Audio Technica I ended up looking up to see what models they made and found that their Bluetooth line was expanding quite decently I ended up trying the ath sr6 bt b ches oh my god that's mouthful which were audio Technica's new high-resolution bluetooth headphones first of all I did like these headphones but I couldn't figure out what was missing from the sound they were very clear in the highs and the mids which I do love but they lacked so much in the bass it just made music so boring it sounded as if there was a low-pass filter that just removed the bass from all the songs yes it made all the lyrics and the music much clearer but I hated how it sounded they were light and comfortable and I appreciated that they paired with NFC but that just sounded too tinny to keep as my daily drivers pun totally intended by the way and that brought me to the other end of the spectrum with get ready the a th WS six60 btg BLS audio Technica's answered to all the people who wanted bass in their headphones but it turns out that those people also hate hearing vocals and mid-range music fun fact these headphones although they are great for bass heavy music with no vocals I just couldn't deal with them sounding muddy half the time I really tried to give these a go but they were just so light and they would fall off constantly I hated how they felt on my head I just couldn't trust them not to break after everyday use so I finally gave in and bit the bullet and decided to spend the money and try out the m50x bTW much more reasonable name by the way and holy crap I am home Audio Technica it just just hold me I was a lost child out in the rain and I finally saw the light no seriously all jokes aside the moment I put these headphones on my head I felt like an old friend came back into my life and everything was just right in the world I kid you not these are literally the perfect headphones and I'm hard-pressed to believe that you could find something to impress me more at the same value as these guys same as my review from five years ago they sound absolutely phenomenal with striking highs full meds and the tight punchy bass that I love although they are a little bit bigger than your average headphones the benefit of them being on the bulkier side allows them to fit in those 45 millimeter drivers which make them so special and the fact that they use the Qualcomm aptX standard for Bluetooth which gives them a decent bandwidth advantage over other regular headphones also that giant battery I've said it so many times in the past and I'll say it again I cannot believe that there is a better pair of headphones that exist out there at a better value than these honestly if you're worried about spending the money trust me they will last you a lifetime since these are bluetooth I can't speak about how the battery will last over time but as of right now it's ridiculous how long of battery I got on these I was actually waiting for them to die to test them and see if it worked without a battery and just a cable and it took me almost two weeks to kill them when I first got them I was using them every single day and for the first week they still said they were at 80% I just couldn't get it below that your mileage may vary based on how much you use them in terms of battery life but for me two weeks is basically guaranteed because I plugged them in and use them wired when I'm at my desk at work and yes they do work that way which is awesome along with when the Bluetooth is off you can use them without a battery by just plugging in the cable and that's such a godsend I don't know why more headphones don't do this so all in all this isn't as much a review as much as a confession of my love for the m50x BTS and honestly I think you owe it to yourself to give them a shot or don't because everything else was I'm terrible after thanks so much for watching guys this was a bit of a different style of video I know but as a five year user of these headphones I had a bit more to save and just how comfortable they are it feels good to be making videos again apologies there's a few months of nothing it's been the most hectic time of my life now to kick off 2019 and I promise I'm not gone and I will be making more videos this year I've got a couple exciting videos lined up and I hope that you guys are excited to see them subscribe so you don't miss them and thanks everyone for 4,000 subscribers it truly means a lot to see people interested in what I have to say anyway so I'll see you guys on the next one take care"

405,o8u7H7uAV8Q,GameSpot,UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw,The Best Wireless Gaming Headset Of 2020? - SteelSeries Arctis 9 Review,"Dave has been playing with the new Arctis 9 headset from SteelSeries, complete with 2.4GHz wireless, a Discord certified microphone and VERY comfy ear cups.

Dave got some ears-on with SteelSeries' new Arctis 9 Wireless headset, featuring 2.4 Ghz wireless transmission, Bluetooth, retractable noise cancelling microphone and compatibility with both the PlayStation 4, and upcoming PlayStation 5.

The headset also includes a wireless range of 40ft, as well as a 20 hour battery life and audio pass-through to allow for easy use with your desktop speaker or mobile

headset|steelseries arctis 9|arctis 9|arctis 9 review|steelseries arctis 9 review,2020-10-07 10:22:47.662549, i've had pretty middling experiences with wireless headphones in the past but i think i finally found a set that suits this irregular sized cranium so why do i think the steel series arctis 9 are finally the wireless headphones for me i mean firstly they look great they're clean simple they've got this nice matte finish to them the steel frames sturdy while being lights but because they're not overly gamery i feel like i can actually wear these away from my desk if i want to go for a walk or other shops and not have little timmy point and look and be like oh look there's a nerd let's get him and if i want to get away from my desk i can even hide the microphone inside the ear cup so this point they're just a nice set of earphones like i said the steel frame makes them extremely durable lightweight flexible to the point that paired with the ski goggle headband that steel series use even on my giant head they're perfectly comfortable so if you have a human sized head and you're not some kind of missing evolution link like i am chances are they're gonna be a great fit for you as well i'm also a huge fan of the breathable ear cups that steel series use none of that fake plastic leather sort of thing that gets real sweaty when your room is anything above like 20 degrees celsius and if you have headphones for too long they start flaking off and falling apart no no no no no nice and breathable nice and comfortable feels great against my skin i've been wearing these for six to ten hours a day for the past 5 days and i have not had a single complaint or felt discomfort even once but headphones aside for a second the other feature that comes in the box is the steelseries wireless hub this is probably it probably makes one of my favorite features of the whole kit that you get now steelseries claims that this thing has a range of 40 feet using its 2.4 gigahertz wireless connection i haven't been walking around with a tape measure i must admit but i have been able to go to every room in my house and venture forth with into the garden without any quality drop or any signals cutting out whatsoever so for normal everyday use this thing is probably going to go above and beyond what you want it to do but you also have the option of using the 2.4 gigahertz wireless connection in tandem with the bluetooth capability of the headphones that means for if if for some bizarre reason you want to wear these listen to your game audio and your discord audio but also play music through your phone to the headphones you can do that i don't know really why you'd want to do that that sounds like a bit of a cacophony to me but hey it's nice to have options but for me the best quality of life that dongle gives you as opposed to standard wireless headphones that just come on a usb is that the hub features audio in and out now that means you can use your computer speakers in tandem with the wireless headphones and what i mean by that is that as soon as you turn the headphones on your computer audio will switch from speaker to headphones and vice versa as soon as you turn them off back to speakers and it's doing all that without you having to suffer and like oh go down i need to go to my my device menu speakers virtual headphones select playback device none of that it's a faff it's not going to mess up your discord input outputs it's not going to make you suffer through scrolling down it's a minor issue i know but it's a it's so frustrating when you just want to listen to your speakers it only takes a few seconds and it means that i don't have to fiddle with windows select playback device nonsense it's not going to mess up my discord audio inputs or outputs just turn the thing off listen to my computer it's a small feature but i love it it fixes that pet peeve for me bless speaking of discord the microphone that's included is discord certified now it's not going to blow your socks off when it comes to audio quality but it's got enough gain it's got enough noise cancellation that doesn't pick up my clicky clacky keyboard and most importantly it's clear enough that i can make effective enemy call outs when playing escape from tarkov or deliver my well-rehearsed speech as to why i'm in fact not the imposter while playing among us with friends the overall sound quality of these has been pretty great they do come out of the box pretty level across the board maybe if not a touch heavy on the bass but if you're like me you like a bassier experience when it comes to your games and music then they're likely going to be ideal if you do want to tailor your audio experience a bit more steel series has its own software with an equalizer so you can really tailor the audio experience to suit your tastes the axis nines also come with dts headphones 2.0 which is meant to simulate that kind of surround sound vibe inside your headphones now for me and the games i play it's completely fine i've not noticed a huge uptick in me being able to pinpoint enemy locations or really know which angle gunfire is coming from but from what i'm aware in the sevens it was an optionable toggleable thing in the software now it seems like a small step back keeping it enabled all the time i've looked in the software and i can't find the option to turn it off so it's it's not a hugely intrusive feature but it's a shame that you don't have the option to play around with it and flick it on and off you also have the on-the-fly game to avoid mix controls so with a little turn of this wheel you can turn your discord up or your game up in relation to each other makes it world easy and you don't have to tab out and fiddle with your levels you just turn the wheel find something that suits you and you're comfortable with my only gripe with these controls however is they are exactly where your thumbs sit where you put the headphone on or you take off so pretty much every time i take the headset off or put it on i'm messing with the levels that i might have been happy with before or i'll rejoin a discord call after go and get a parcel or go to the bathroom or whatever and all of a sudden i can't hear anything and i have to spend like 20 seconds just oh well i can hear you again yep oh no hang on oh they left the call with these minor gripes aside though this thing does everything i want it to music movies games let me sit on the toilet without audio interruptions dude what the hell all that coupled with a 20 hour battery life as well as being able to use these on my ps4 and steelseries have said that they will work on the upcoming ps5 that is the whole feature set except for the chat to game volume mixer i've got to say me and my large head we couldn't be that much happier oh but before i go this one thing on the box really made me laugh the box says pros have won more prize money with steel series than any other brand i good for them i mean i'm not gonna win no money i'm a bit of a scrub but hey steel series i respect the weird flex but for nearly a week of me using these things those are my thoughts let me know if you have any other questions about these in the comments section down below or if you want us to take a look at any other bit of tech or hardware then feel free to let me know on twitter as well until next time if you want to stay tuned for all the tech news hardware reviews pc gaming and everything in between make sure you subscribe to gamespot you

headphone transmitter set so this is the Avant rewire 'less headphone transmitter set product code HT four one eight nine if you're here to see what this does you probably know what type of product this already is if you just happen to walk upon this it is essentially a wireless headphone and transmitter set that you plug this into the TV sit back and listen to it on this so you don't disturb the other folks in the hice ors flat or apartment or a vote that you happen to be dwelling or dwelling that you happen to be a boding if you need help you can contact the people there and here we have some of the facts and features no pairing is required no lip sync delay that's a bold statement optical support and up to 40 hours playtime haha there are some more specifications down there for you to run down and have a readout and guess there's something that you want to know like the frequency response on the impedance the driver size is 40 millimeters hmm okay so it runs off bluetooth 4.2 no bluetooth 4.1 the headphones are for use with 4.1 but the transmitter is 4.2 uses a dude a 2d p and supports various codecs and operates up to either 100 feet or 30 meters alright so let's get it right hook it up and see how it works already we have support information right on the front of the box with phone numbers that you can call if you're in trouble with it how wonderful is that how often you see that that well done Avon tree you deserve a round of applause one hold all in a box so am I let you upload quietly Adam okay inside we get a user guide on the top get a care product or sorry get a free product buy four or more Avanti products and get a fifth one for free of equal or lesser value than the cheapest item purchased yes still on five point points off when you spend no five dollars off when you spend $25 or more that worksite does have the UK numbers on the back there so there there there Boston for you to get in touch with them decent amount of instructions therefore if and when things may go wrong here is the transmitter okay so we have a Vaughn tree written there I'm guessing these little buttons light up whenever we start to use them and we've got a and B USB auxiliary optical Bluetooth SBC FS apdex and ll so I'm guessing that SBC's one of the codecs a fascist fast stream isn't it and then aptX is apt X and I thought apt accent dear or ll or the sea and or well maybe there are maybe there's no a slightly different version okay run the back we have the model number input us 500 milliamps optical and FCC information little rubber feet and yeah we have stuff around the back we have ports on the back so we have the DC in which is a micro USB we have an optical kick cable we have an optical port and auxiliary and an on/off switch very simple and I'm guessing these are just channels that you can switch between in case you're getting interference or something like that bomb I could be wrong and then we have the headphones which are actually really nice yes they are they're they're kind of the old school style headphones and they're very light so we'll start at the top we have like a faux leather on the top with some brine stitching and they're adjustable with the cool old fashioned bits of metal sticking out for you to adjust and there's a braided cable that connects well obviously one to the other that goes up and in here and there's a little bit of rubber here with a bit of a texture on it which is kind of nice there's a little instruction guide there of how to turn it on so yeah we'll come back and then there might be maybe a microphone with some description there there's a something you can pull out okay so that's the microUSB for charging and now 3.5 millimeter headphone jack for the possible time that you actually run out of charge there's another hole there that could be an LED light you know the dishonor off then that could be I'd love to think that that was a microphone so it's possible it could be we'll check that out in the review and we have some nice ear cups they're very soft leather with a bit of foam in here as well it's not just a piece of material covering the driver that was actual fool in there that's that's nice it looks like it's gonna be quite comfortable then on the side we have which is the right headphone so we have the indicators here we have avanti's Nouveau there have on trees Louisville there and that's that so press and hold mfb for three seconds until blue LED is on for one second okay so we got a blue LED and it said welcome to of on tree-sweet okay and click volume up and down to change the volume right so what we need to do is set something up to be able to test this with using this one thing springs to mind now that I've just run around and find a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack I'll have a look at Messiah see what else there is Wow we get on an optical cable as well and then we get a bunch of cables brilliant I've on tree thinking that's wonderful okay so we get a micro USB cable for charging Martenot charging powering which we will plug in okay so we're still in the off position I suppose I'm looking for lights and we're not the enemy we have another microUSB cable I'm guessing for charging these we have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack cable and we have followed a phono which this isn't entirely compatible with okay so I run a run find these so I'm going to use these I've plugged it in to my phone to stream some music I'm gonna go for a little bit of Led Zeppelin I believe and if I turn this on actually I'm going to place these on my head so that I can tell you what audio cues there are let's treat it it's telling me that it's connected straightaway it's scanning and it's find that there's an axillary plugged in and that Bluetooth is there if we hit over to be it's not let me do anything there but I'm gonna go straight away I'm try this and just see how the music signs coming through on the on the headphones alright so having listened through to two songs on Led Zeppelin there they are pretty good headphones they they do give off a good sign they're they're very well tuned for music and the volume works very well too I took it down to dying stairs with them I don't that the building I'm in isn't particularly large it's a double garage with a roof space so I took it down to Ron both rooms downstairs it didn't cut out or anything that was that there was no particular disturbance whatsoever it was a very very strong signal the whole time so I'm gonna have a quick blast at some some Netflix just to see how how well it copes with me skipping around and things like that to see if it keeps up with the lip-sync as it brags alright so Netflix and YouTube do sound very good on these as well they're they're good all-round headphones I have to say and the fact that they're streaming live from this makes them a pretty good option no I have had a look at some of these in the past from one end of the spectrum to the other I've seen the the San Heiser flex 5000 that I own myself and I love I use those quite frequently no as frequently as I thought I would I also had a look at jelly combs offering which was a lot cheaper than these I believe there were 30 pounds in total and they did very well as well however the headphones were nowhere near as comfortable as these these things are fantastically comfortable initially having only used them for a few minutes to skip through some some good signing stuff and good music and I'm quite impressed with these and I think I would sit down for an evening but I'm not going to have that option I got to fire these out to Peter for him to do a full review on so let me know if you have any questions or anything you want them to test in particular in the show notes down below hit that subscribe button and give us we thumbs up if you fancy and other than that take care

have something really exciting we have the brand new wireless headphones from drop these are the panda and so a drop is trying to do is create a audio file level pair of wireless headphones and these are a pre-production model these are I think one of the first samples that they've really sent out for review so we're getting to take a look at it and I'm excited to share it with you so let's check it out thanks for watching nine to five toys be sure to LIKE subscribe and enable notifications so you don't miss any upcoming videos so if you're not familiar with drop or mass drop as it used to be called they were originally a kind of a group of buying website so communities would come together and you know agree to purchase you know one or more of a certain product and then they would go to the company and say hey we have you know three hundred orders for this thing can we get a special deal on it and so bring the price a little bit down and then they would you know pick something else and all the community would get together and once they had enough votes they would all vote for it so it's kind of how mass drop started but then as I continued they took that community mindset and started using it to develop and design different pieces of equipment and clothing and the latest one they came out with is this and it's called the Panda a wireless pair of headphones that should give audiophile quality sound and you are gonna be paying a little bit more for that audiophile quality sound right now the MSRP is 399 so obviously not the cheapest pair of headphones but if you're looking for the highest quality wireless headphones you can find and you're probably spending something in that price point anyways so right off the bat one of the things that I really like about the Panda is it's a very simple functional elegant design and actually you don't I've only found the drop name in two different places once it's you know very small here on the inside of the headband right here you'll get a close-up of that and then the other one is on the strap of the carrying case you know other than that there aren't really any markings all over it it's a very simple elegant functional design which I really enjoy so on the right ear cup we'll find the USB port for charging the control stick a super small discreet status LED and if you look close there are two microphones and on the left hand we have only the 3.5 milimeter port for passive inputs the control stick which is located here on the right ear cup can be moved up down left right four different controls I can evolve all Youm down skipping the next tracks and then also for controlling calls and then it can also be pushed in for pausing and playing and accepting and rejecting calls as well I really like this method of controlling wireless headphones that's something we saw on the Marshall headphones we checked out a little while ago the little four directional control they can also be pushed in and that's just a really really nice tactile way of controlling all the functions on your headphone without putting in a bunch of different buttons on here and we'll show you the design of the case really quick so you open it up and there's a little other little pocket in here where you can put your cables so you have it comes with release this one did I'm not sure what the actual production unit will but this one came with a USB type-c cable and also a 3.5 millimeter to 3.5 millimeter cable those just easily stick down and there there's a little magnet that closes that so it was really nice and secure and with the headphones obviously they are adjustable you can pull them out and push them back in to fit your head but the nice thing about this case is that even fully extended you can just lay them down in here and it'll still fit fine you don't have to push them in and you know totally mess up your adjustment setting which is a really nice feature on the inside of the ear cups I've actually been noticing a few companies doing this lately which I'm a huge fan of you just put a big L and a big R right inside the ear cups to let you know which is left and which is right I think that's a very classy way of doing it you know it doesn't put it anywhere else but it's also very visible there but not visible when you are wearing the headphones so in the announcement post that drop posted they said that the weight was going to be at or under 350 grams and so I put this on steel and tested it out and it was coming in at a little bit over that at 380 so obviously 30 grams isn't a whole lot but I was kind of curious what was causing that difference and if they actually intended on hitting that 350 mark for production line so I sent a message to their head of product marketing and asked them you know what is causing that difference and if they plan on actually hitting that mark for production and he said that the engineers said that on this limited sample run they actually had to change the damping solution a little bit so they think that's what's causing the difference in weight but they still plan on hitting the 350 mark and if they don't that they'll just update the specs to you know reflect what actually is and despite that extra weight I didn't find the pan that cumbersome at all I mean don't get me wrong they are a substantial pair of headphones they have a little bit of weight to them but I don't really take that as a bad thing it kind of feels like they're a little bit higher quality because of that you know what also helps with that is you know in combination with the headband which has a little rubberized grip on here so it doesn't move much and the grip from the ear cups on your head it feels really comfortable with the cushions as well drop actually designed to the Panda so that the weight is held by the grip from the ear cups not so much the headband and these protein leather wrapped plush foam ear cups pack plenty of padding they feel plenty comfortable I didn't have any issues wearing them so obviously these are meant to be used on the go in a mobile setting and at their core they are a closed back design which also aids in acoustic isolation you won't find any active noise-cancelling on these but because of the grip from the ear cups and the closed back design they actually do a pretty decent job of blocking out a lot of noise it'll be something similar to like a in ear monitor so design wise the only flaw that I've really seen with the Panda so far is and I'm gonna attribute it to this being a pre-production sample but on the headband there's one little corner that the little rubber grip keeps kind of sticking out and coming loose a little bit and so like I said I'm just gonna trigger that to being a flaw of you know these sample units and I highly doubt that'll be a issue in in the actual production run and the rest of this feels extremely well built extremely solid and I've been very pleased with the fit and finish of the drop so one really nice thing was that I attended CES 2020 recently and will bright who is a co-founder of drop and also heads up most of the product development was there with thx showing off these headphones and talking about how they're using the thx technology within the headphones and so he's obviously really excited about these headphones because drop finally feels like the technology exists for you know audiophile quality sound in a wireless pair of headphones the combination of driver technology from the Oppo PM 3 thx triple-a amplification in Sony's L DAC make it truly one of the best sounding pairs of wireless headphones noticing the popularity of the PM 3 with audio files drop took that technology and brightened it up just a little bit to kind of offset the common critique that the PM 3 is were just a little bit too dark and to power those drivers drop is using the thx triple a discrete amplifier and it drives listening plenty loud uncomfortably loud for me at max volume that being said I did try it for a albeit short amount of time at max volume and I didn't hear any distortion when listening to him and then the third technology that makes this possible to get a wireless audio file pair of headphones is Sony's L DAC beyond just Bluetooth aptX aptX HD and aptX adaptive this L DAC is the closest wireless headphones can get to true audiophile bit rates unfortunately I was told that this isn't operational in this sample pair yet so I wasn't able to actually try that which is a bummer but even without that these things sound incredible the combination of those three technologies creates an incredible sounding pair of headphones that are easy to use when mobile polarity of bounds to pick out instruments and cluttered tracks and the neutral tone puts it squarely in the reference category also mentioned in drops announcement of the Panda is that there's no DSP found in panda another big thing that they wanted to push with the Panda was battery life obviously this is a wireless pair of headphones that you want to be able to use for a while so they claim that I'll have up to 30 hours of battery life that's really impressive for a pair of headphones that can get this loud when I first opened the box and turned them on there was a voice prompt that told me that the battery was low and then they ended up actually turning off because the battery was so low so I plugged it in and started charging it and within about two hours it was fully charged and the LED light was white letting me that it was ready to go speaking of mobility these also have microphone built-in so that you can take calls while you're listening to music and so here we'll give a little sample of what that sounds like and I think we mentioned earlier but the microphones are located there to little things down here on the right ear cup so I'll put these on I have them connected to my phone already and we're just going to start recording in the voice memos app on my iPhone 8 thanks for watching 9:00 to 5:00 toys be sure to LIKE subscribe and enable notifications with the bell icon C don't miss any upcoming videos hi this is Jordan with nine-to-five toys so there you can get an idea of what the microphone sounds like obviously it's not you know perfect but it's not bad either and it's really easy to find the controls here to control all of that so all-in-all I've been really happy with the drop Panda wireless headphones the battery life is great the sound is incredible they're comfortable and I think they're really well designed they are a little bit expensive at 399 but if you're looking for you know high-quality wireless headphones this is obviously going to be one of your best choices for that and also unfortunately these aren't available yet this is a pre-production sample unit so right now drop is thinking that at the end of January is when the product will launch but will actually start shipping closer to summer so it'll be a little bit till we actually see these available on the market but drop is doing different events around the country we can actually go check them out so at CES they had a couple different examples available and I think they're hosting something at their office as well if you are close to that and want to go check it out I hope you enjoyed this look at the pre-production version of the drop panda and thanks for watching if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up and consider subscribing this is Jordan with nine-to-five toys [Music] you

423,CmOfWQYh88s,Jake Reeves,UCk-_Zcn4aHKDYuEHD3FutuA,2-Months with 2 of Amazon's BEST Cheap NOISE CANCELLING Wireless Headphones,"Over the last few years, cheap wireless headphones have been getting good.  If you've been looking for a pair that offer Active Noise Cancellation lately, you've probably come across the TaoTronics SoundSurge 60's (TT-BH060) and the Cowin SE7's.  Both are a terrific value, but each has its pros and cons.

wireless headphones that have active noise cancellation the taotronics sound surge 60 and the cohen SE sevens the taotronics will cost about $70 whereas the Cohen's cost about 120 both are available on Amazon and quite often have discounts that can be applied in addition to make them even cheaper the reason I want to look at these two headphones is because they show up in a lot of searches for what the best value headphones are both are very similar in terms of styling with matte black finishes and very sporty looks with very minimal branding something that appealed to me right away so let's take a look first let's talk about battery life both claimed to give about 30 hours of playback the taotronics come in really close to that I would say I'm getting about 30 hours on average whereas the Cohens come in closer to about 20 hours when you're using active noise cancellation so given that I would have to give the advantage to the taotronics additionally they do offer fast charging so in five minutes of charging you can get an additional two hours of playback time here whereas with the cohens it's about 10 minutes of charging to get an additional out which isn't bad but overall in terms of battery it definitely goes to the Payette rocks next let's talk about the build fit and form both are pretty well built they have that very similar matte black finish with this hard plastic which feels quite nice to the touch I would have to give the advantage here though in terms of build quality to the Coens overall they're just a little sturdier and this hinge mechanism puts up some resistance which feels quite premium additionally the earcup pads are very very soft they're protein based as opposed to standard foam which is really nice and very very comfortable if you're going to be wearing them for extended periods of time I regularly wear them for about two to three hours time I would have to say that these are definitely more comfortable than the taotronics having said that the ear cups are smaller on these compared to the taotronics so you will have to take that into consideration if you do have larger ears additionally they're not quite as stable on your because the TAM trying to provide a little bit more clamping force overall it is nice that both of them do fold up a nice and compact let's say the cones are slightly smaller overall but not enough to make a real difference taking a look at the controls both are very similar they have the same buttons so you get power on/off volume up/down and then a toggle in order to enable active noise cancellation on the taotronics that toggle is on the front with a little LED that shows up whereas on the Coens that button is on the back in order to hide the LED it's kind of nice that it's a little more discreet but overall the buttons are a little closer here which makes it harder to distinguish between them so I have to get the advantage to the taotronics additionally the cohens take a little bit longer than expected to turn on and off which is problematic because when you go to turn them off you trigger pairing at the same time right before turning it off so you can stake the vocal cue for pairing or turning it off and then let go of the button too early without powering them down I've done that a lot and it's something that was really annoying at first and it's only over the last week or so that I've actually gotten used to it on the cones next in terms of sound quality both are good neither is going to compete with bows at $300 price points but at this price point of around $100 they're certainly better than I expected I would have to give an overall edge here to the coins they just sounded a little bit clearer in the treble then the taotronics did but both are certainly a little bit bass heavy so if you like listening to bass music this is probably pretty good another thing worth noting is that the Coens have a BT X so if you like to listen to high five music that's an advantage that you're definitely going to get out of the Coens whereas it's not present in the taotronics now if you're just listening to Spotify right now and 2019 they don't have HiFi sound so you'd be able to get away with either but if you're on a music service like title and you're paying for that additional five dollars a month in order to get the premium sound you're definitely going to want to go with the cohens another thing worth noting is the latency overall it's better on the Coens there are only about a hundred and thirty milliseconds latency whereas the taotronics are closer to 230 so that's a big advantage to the poem I would have to say that you know it's still Bluetooth I wouldn't expect to use them for gaming but if you're used to seeing a little bit of a mismatch in what you see when watching a movie on your laptop and what you hear you'd be better off going with the Cohens then with the taotronics in terms of noise isolation so just looking at passive noise isolation what they cancel out when nothing is turned on here it's very easy to say that the taotronics are better they block out a lot of sound just naturally whereas the Cohens are pretty much average in this category they don't block out a lot what that really means in real life though is that if you're listening to music at very low volume with the taotronics you'd be safe to have somebody at the desk next to you talking and you wouldn't be able to hear anything whereas if they're having a conversation next to you and the music's on really low with the Coens you'll probably hear a little bit of their conversation it's not a huge deal for me because I don't work in a really loud environment but if you're somebody who likes to commute and maybe you're on the subway and your whole point of getting noise cancelling headphones is to make sure that you block it out the taotronics are definitely better in this category in terms of active noise cancellation it's really hard to do a direct comparison because the isolation is so much better on the taotronics having said that though if you just listen to the difference between having them turn on and turn off I would have to give an advantage here to the Cohens on cheap headphones with active noise cancellation you typically get this humming sound in the background that can be a little bit annoying when active noise cancellation is enabled that's more prominent on the taotronics it's certainly not problematic but more prominent whereas with the Coens it's hardly noticeable which is actually really nice at this price point and I'm very happy with overall it's not going to make a big difference if you're listening to music it's just when you have nothing else playing or perhaps if you're listening to an audiobook that you would really notice that humming in the background additionally it's worth noting that when you turn on active noise cancellation for either of these the equalization does change a little bit it's not a huge deal when you're listening to music I could hardly notice it but if you're listening to an audiobook you can definitely tell that the sound better when active noise cancellation is turned off as opposed to turn upon overall both of these headphones are really good for the price point that they're at the fact that you can get either of these for around $100 is pretty incredible the sound quality is good they have pretty good active noise cancellation and really they're quite comfortable if you are somebody with larger ears though I would recommend going with the taotronics additionally if you are somebody who commutes on a subway or in a lab environment these would be good I personally work in an office where people are talking around me and the Cohens are perfectly good for that overall if you don't need either of the isolation or the larger ear fit I would recommend spending a little bit more money to get the Coens just because overall they're more comfortable for me and I can wear them for three hours without any issue whatsoever that's all I got for you today though if you liked this video or found it helpful in any way

wireless headphones I've been using them for a couple of months now and I'm gonna tell you what I like what I don't like and how much I think they're worth hey guys first I want to apologize for missing the past couple of weeks but I'm glad I'm back and you guys know I got the a cage with a galaxy note 9 a couple of months ago and I've been using them just have been basically my primary headphones so for pretty much everything when I'm on conference calls at work at home when I'm listening to music when I'm watching TV or just watching YouTube listening to you to basically been using these headphones for a while now and first thing I want to talk about is that the overall design the headband and the ear cups they're gonna be made of leather the headband is not the most comfortable one especially if you have long hair I feel like this headband is gonna be pulling your hair it doesn't have much of padding on the top and if you use them for the wallet for a while you're gonna feel like there's gonna be adding some friction and it's gonna maybe hurt you a little bit over time when it comes to the ear cuffs this are going to be pretty pretty small so you have larger head or if you have large ears this may be pretty uncomfortable I personally I feel like these are probably one of the best headphones I'd views so far I haven't tried that many but for me they work just perfect on the sides you can have the markings so you know when you have your perfect feed you can get it to the right exact spot every single time I notice that if I just wear them randomly they will start hurting my ears but once I get them to the right position I can wear them for over two hours and I don't feel any discomfort that is just something to keep in mind overall the ear cups that some people have complained that they cap come off for them in the past I've personally been using AKG for a couple of years now and they've been working just fine I mean the ear cups have not come off on any of the headphones that I have I have the AKG fifty and those are also still holding up pretty good when it comes to the outer rings you're gonna have this chrome design with the black the the chrome is still holding up pretty good I bang them a few times and and I haven't had that many scratches on them so overall quality I feel I feel are they holding pretty good even though they feel liberal plasticky but that may be something good because if this headphones are going to be pretty light which is something else that to consider if you're gonna be using this for the wall you don't want to have some headphones that are gonna haul down your head with a lot a lot of weight but again keep in mind that this may not be for everybody I noticed on the reviews seems like people that tend to have large hits that they don't don't like them a lot real quick let's talk about the buttons and some of the features so on the right cup you're gonna have on the top you're gonna have your volume rockers buttons are pretty clickable very easy to find they're pretty separated to the audio track control and your actual sliding track to enable the Bluetooth and the noise cancellation feature little further down you're gonna have the microphone and you're gonna have your audio track slide and mechanism so this one thing to keep in mind a lot of report don't know this but this is gonna work to skip the track go to the next track or previous track but this also is a button so if you press on it it's gonna pass play the song or is gonna answer the phone call or it's gonna end the phone call so keep that in mind it's an actual button itself further down you're gonna have the actual sliding button or sliding pad that it's going to allow you to enable the Bluetooth and enable the noise cancellation feature another thing to keep in mind is once you enable the Bluetooth you're also enabling in the noise cancellation feature which is pretty much gonna eat your battery if you're not using them and another complaint that I have on this is that I always forget to turn them off so you're supposed to get about 15 hours of battery life I honestly haven't been able to make it there because I always forget to turn them off it doesn't matter how much you try it I always forget so I have to charge them maybe every other day I probably end up using them for four to five hours before I have to charge them and that's because I always forget to turn them off and it seems like the Bluetooth and the nose canceling just stay on they continue using it but again I don't know that I was expecting this to just kind of turn off and stab using the battery life something that I'm having medicine on myself you also have your LED indicator in the bottom that will let you know when you have to put it on and also will start blinking red when the battery is getting low and when you're charging them as well it's gonna start is gonna let you know when it's fully charged or when it's charging also another thing to keep in mind is with some of the phones not every single phone is not likely to do this but you can actually check the battery level for example in the galaxy note 9 I can go to the options I'm gonna have them connected it will tell me how much percentage I have left in the battery I believe their iPhones do a pretty good job of doing that but a lot of the other Android phones like the no date no they note forward they they don't have the capability I was expecting the Narayan or they to have that but my particular unit does not tell me that so I don't you guys let me know if you're able to get the know today to tell you the battery level on years further out let's move into the other ear cup so you got your audio jack which again you're gonna have those come with it with the cable but one side is gonna be the 2.5 millimeter audio jack output input and on the other side is going to be here or your regular 3.5 so you're not gonna be able to use just your average howdy jack that you have four other headphones too something to keep in mind and you also have your micro USB charging port with an LED indicator which I was talking about earlier where it will blink red and let you know when it's charging or when the battery is getting low now going back to the idea cable you're gonna have the inline control basically it's going to have another microphone here it's going to allow you to use this when you're done having them connected to bluetooth and you don't have a button that it's gonna give you some basic controls when it comes to the microphone quality I think that AKG have one of the best microphones are using my work conference calls I always have asked many people to give me their feedback and they always sound clear I'm always able to use them for any call and I never had issues people understanding what I'm saying also another thing that I like about these headphones is that when I'm putting them away or they when I just leave them in the table they fall different ways you can either fold them sideways where they can easily sit on top of the table or when you're on the go you can just basically fold them in and they basically take in feeling pretty much any of your back set that you have if you can either put them in carrying pouch that it comes with or just throw them in your your backpack now when it comes to the audio quality these are not gonna be the best headphones when it comes to that bass a key G's is known for not having bass headphones and all the headphones earphones that I used before those headphones will not have as much space they're gonna do okay I mean if you're listening to a song in the house bass is not gonna sound bad but you're just not gonna get that basis based you're just getting like with the bit so that's what probably one of the things that you have to keep in mind when it comes to just overall sound quality just listening to all the music or just again just watching videos regular audio YouTube I think it does pretty good it sounds really clear and when it comes to the noise cancellation headphones I kind of have mixed feelings I know I'm not an expert on headphones but these are my first noise cancellation headphones so they're you're not gonna filter out all the noise 100% so I think if you want to get better headphones like Bose or some of the Sony ones that go over your ear that basically block most of the environment always these are not gonna do that these are going to go on your ears against our smaller ear but they're gonna go on top of your ears and they're gonna filter a lot of the noise but it's not gonna go away completely and it does a pretty good job I mean if you are for example when I'm sitting next to the AC unit it's pretty loud but put them on turn on the noise cancellation feature and it just basically mellows down the nose you can still listen to it it's loud mellow down which it doesn't bother you and and then it does how it's supposed to work if you are in the Train if you are in an airplane or just outside on the street and there's a lot of noise now these headphones were originally selling for about $300 they sell between 150 to 300 dollars depending on worrying when you check I definitely don't recommend you pay more than 150 dollars for them I know their AKG a lot of times you paying for a brand and the quality is there that they're supposed to last you a while and AKG is usually a consistent company that delivers from what they promise but I personally feel like they probably worth about $100 or that's something that I'm much how much I will be willing to pay for them 150 dollars may be pushing it but if you check for example in offer up Facebook marketplace I'll let go you're gonna see that there's a lot of people selling these headphones and that's because many of them got them through the promotions with the Galaxy Note phone so and I noticed that some people have been selling them $400 and even less I saw them once going out for about $85 new in a box so keep an eye out there on them I mean there's gonna be people trying to ask $200 $250 $150 you're gonna notice that those people are not gonna sell them but if you just keep your eye on it and you're gonna be able to pick them off for about $100 at least that's what I have noticed here in Dallas but those were my thoughts about the AKG in headphones there be my primary headphones and they're gonna continue to be luckily I got a massive gift with the Galaxy Note phone but I'd love to hear what you have to say let me know if you have any questions in the comment section below let's have that conversation thank you for watching make sure you smash the like button discontent and I'll see you on the next one

In this repair video we will be working on the Beats Wireless headphones that came in for now power. Customer said he had to wiggle the charging cable for the headphones to charge, but at one point it just stopped working. The charging port is totally broke off the charging board causing ripped pads. Let's see how we go about fixing the headphones.

429,ZZQHjS4nSJw,GadgetsBoy,UCOnA4oZccE0dxZjI733EjSw,AKG N200 Wireless Headphones Review: Looks Good On Paper,"The AKG N200 wireless headphones is a pair of headphones that looks good on paper in terms of specs, compatibility, design and more, but the reality if you asked me if I'd recommend them to you? I'd struggle to say so.  The sound quality is great but when it comes to phone calls, it struggled at times.  They rarely go into standby and when the magnet clasps, it doesn't stop it from functioning, therefore draining its battery.

headphones|akg n200,2020-10-07 10:22:47.663124, how's it going everyone is gadgets boy welcome to another video and today we'll be taking a look at the brand-new AKG headphones here this is a 10200 wireless headphones if that focuses let's see let's see come on Sony nevermind you guys would see more about it in a second for us let's take a look at what's inside a box so you guys will know what to expect if you're looking to buy one of these and then I'll talk you through my experience with it it's got all the things all the specs for it to excel really well but there are tiny little niggles here in there that I've found when using it that to be honest should not be asking used to but we'll talk you through that in a second let's check it out so when you take it outside of the box you get everything you need to get started like a cable to charge it it's there you got a case as well you got loads of light here tips and buds so that you can get the perfect fitting for your hair drums so the one that usually comes with earphones and general fits in my tears with no problem so I didn't have to change it at all but it's very easy to swap over including the shark fin that goes inside you here kind of thing to keep it secure so it's very easy to change and so on so this is this art in here and what you notice straight away is you've got an inline control and on this inline control you have your microphone a function button the port's to charge it it's a micro USB again this is something that I expected that AKG Samsung Harman whoever would opt it updated his by that to a USB see it she'd be phasing out by now you got the volume control which gonna also be used for changing tracks you got the starts and stop and and start answer phone call button and so on and you got this LED indicator lights there as well so you can see when it's pairing and so on and you've got microphone like I said already and a flap that covers the port's for charging as well what I really like about the cable the the strap here is covered in fabric and you can adjust it and then tie accordingly around the back of your neck so then it keeps it nice and secure so if you're gonna be using it for sports this is very good for that again my experience so far it's been good for making phone calls Audio is excellent bass is good something I expected from AKG anyway so you've got a good audio bass levels are good and mids are good and also the troubles are good as well and you don't really get outside noise as such as well even though they're not noise cancelling so again that's a bonus for someone looking for something like this for training or just using everyday you've got 20 Hertz to 20 kilohertz frequency response again really for audio you've got eight hours of battery with speed charge as well so you can really you can charge it up quickly so with eight hours once I've been using this I've got just around seven hours out of it that's what I'm using it all day long in the office and out and about and making phone calls and so on and to charge it you can charge it quickly within so you get 15 15 minutes of charge will give you an hours use and that is very true this is something they quoted and that's very true with Bluetooth it supports aptX and AAC technology so really good you can use voice a system with this is compatible with bixby google assistant and anything else that you use on your phone if using it with an iPhone you can use the Kinect Siri as well which is really good it's available in black it's also available in green and blue I'm not sure what color this is exactly ugh go for black hair because it's got tiny hints here and there of green as well which are quite liked and the fabric is very comfortable on the neck even when you're sweating it doesn't really affect you as such for those interested in its battery size and this is 110 million power battery in there again will last you up to eight hours depending on your usage pairing is very simple press and hold the middle button there to start pairing it pair with your phone you can pair with multiple devices and as combination accuser you can press to switch between devices as well which can come in very handy for someone like me who uses more than one devices you've also got this magnetic attachment here so if you drop you around you wrap it around your neck attach it like so and you can drop it and it's easy to go so you can store it around your neck cannot worry about losing it one thing I didn't like about that though is even once you've got this like that it doesn't stop the audio it doesn't go into standby mode it doesn't do anything so you're most likely to end up doing and thinking is going into standby and then end up running up the battery if you don't stop your music or disconnect from your device which is something that I really really found fire and that's a bit worrying on this device but besides that audio is good the design is excellent I love how it fits as well this just feels premium you set you back about 129 pounds in the UK I'm not sure anywhere else around the world all the availability sedessa do check on samsung's website where you can purchase this anyway guys that's it for the AKG end 200 let me know what you think one more thing I didn't mention is the app the AKG app on the app of Google Play Store wasn't compatible with this it wasn't um then what maybe they'll introduce something where you can actually control this a little bit and modify the buttons and so when that kind of stuff but yes let me know what you guys think in

headphones|sony 1000xm3 vs drop thx panda|best travel headphones 2020|best commuter headphones 2020,2020-10-07 10:22:47.663191, all right so when it comes to wireless headphones there always seems to be some kind of compromise that we have to make and usually that compromises in the sound Department well that ends today with the collaboration from thx and drop the Panda headphones [Music] what's a gossipy to here today we're gonna be talking about the drop and thx collaboration they panda headphones I'm gonna give you guys my thoughts today the rundown on some of the features that I think are really important the sound profiles and all that good stuff so let's jump into it so right now on IndieGoGo I believe these are three hundred and twenty dollars in the future though I believe they're gonna raise the retail price to four hundred dollars and later I'll give you my thoughts on the pricing and if it's worth it so in the box you're going to get the case which feels great it's always nice some companies provide that protection for your headphones for travel upon opening the case you'll see the headphones in all black and when light hits these headphones it hits differently they look super sleek also in the case they have this little compartment with a little flap that opens and then you can get to the 3.5 millimeter cable and USBC charger now these do have an adjustable headband I do wish there's more clicks though it seems a little bit short and you guys out there with big heads you might be in trouble the headband feels really sturdy though it feels like you're getting the quality product here the headband has rubber up top and it feels comfortable when it's on top of your head the ear cuffs level up and down and left to right to give you the best fit for you the ear cuffs feel great on your ears they don't get too hot they also have this memory foam that just feels so so nice against your skin and it also gives you a proper seal since these are a closed back headphone and they do block out a ton of noise so if you're somebody that takes public transportation or you fly a lot these are going to be a great companion for you because it just block out so much noise even without noise cancellation like I can have music in my room blaring or twitch blaring you know people are talking and yelling over the mic and it just blocks out all of that I just played my music the only reason why I knew my music was playing was because my arm started to rumble on my desk while I was listening to these so on the actual headphones they have like I said a 3.5 millimeter jack in here so if you wanna plug this directly to your phone or another source like a plane you can do that also on the other side you're going to have the USB port for charging so another feature of this headphone that I really love is the media control now all you have to do is hit it up or down that controls the volume left and right skips tracks there's no more trying to double tap or triple tap to go forward and backwards it's super-easy it works in one click and you're good to go and if you press it down you can pause or play your song really really easy system to use I actually love this over the touch controls of the 1000 X and three is because this one you know when you're going forward or backwards or up and down sometimes the 1000 X and three is it doesn't register what you're pressing alright so let's test the sound leakage right now I'm gonna put these on I have the volume at zero on my phone and I'm gonna raise it to a hundred percent to see if you guys can hear it so here we go okay we're at a hundred now this is 50% this is 75% so I'm gonna check the footage and see how much leakage there was but you guys can determine if that is good for you or not so these headphones are using bluetooth 5.0 and is using LD AC technology from Sony now what that means is you get a high bitrate over Bluetooth giving you the best sound quality possible so they really didn't skimp out on the quality of these headphones so before we get into the sound of these headphones let's take a look at the dual microphones I'm gonna drop a sound test for you guys right about now so this is a test of the dual microphones on the Panda headphones now usually with headphones of this type they don't really focus too much on the microphones and I have to say that these headphones are no different it's a little bit echoey but it will get the job done if you just wanted to take that phone call here and there in between your music listening but I wouldn't be taking any conference calls or business calls on these headphones just kind of sounds a little bit distorted in my opinion so these headphones can run for about 30 hours that's about what the Sony 1000x m3s are which I consider the best wireless headphones at the moment well maybe not anymore now most headphones that you're gonna find are gonna be dynamic driver headphone and those are subject to all sorts of distortion but with planar magnetic headphones that gets rid of a lot of the distortion that you might find by using these ribbons now usually you're gonna find these planar and magnetic drivers on the higher end headphones but guys drop has to decide to put them on the pandas and let me tell you guys they use every millimeter of these 55 millimeter playing our magnetic drivers the sound stage is what impressed me the most you'll be hearing instruments in the top bottom right left corners of these headphones every they use every inch of these headphones it's absolutely absurd that they were able to put this kind of soundstage in separation into a closed back headphone it's almost like you know the people responsible for surround sound made these headphones hmm speaking of which this has THX triple-a technology in it and this reduces distortion by twenty to a hundred times insane this is currently what they're calling the world's lowest distortion in any headphone another thing that I love about these headphones that kind of fixes some of the other issues that other wireless headphones have is the volume we've all been there we've been listening to a live set like an EDM live set and the levels just don't get high enough and you can't really feel your music I was able to turn up my music maybe it's about 75% and I already felt like they were too loud that's how loud these gift they get insanely laughs up in there where our previous wireless headphones they'll get to a point where it's like it starts a beeping is that deep like you can't go past a certain point you will never hit that point with the pen another thing that I love about these headphones is there's no gimmicks here everything comes from those drivers there's no extra haptic feedback happening in the background your rumbling from the bass and all the percussions and stuff is coming straight from these headphones straight from the source is organic and it feels and sounds so nice so when the homie bass attack was in town he actually showed me his pair of pandas when I tried them the first thing that happened was the mids slapped me in the face the vocals the bass was there but the vocals with a star of the show and you guys know me I'm a sucker for vocal so these headphones were right up my alley when I loved about it is everything feels so layered sometimes what happens with these gimmicky bass headphones is that the bass actually fails the vocals and the highs and actually kind of overpowers two tracks these keep everything intact allowing the tracks to shine in their own way and not trying to force something upon the track you guys know the first track that I had to try with these was that II oh man that was horrible but that rowdy rich the box sounds incredible on this head like I just had it on repeat playing again and again this headphone is super addictive to listen to not only is this good for rap but this is also good for EDM because of all that soundstage you'll be hearing sounds in every corner of the headphone like I'm before not only that it also shines because of that reason in classical music I don't think just because it's bass heavy that it just ruins all classical music it does a very good job of separating all the instruments that you want to hear so if you're feeling fancy you want to listen to some classical music you can do those with these headphones in terms of sound quality in my opinion nothing comes close to these in the wireless realm not the P X is not the 1000 X and 3 is not the boses these are the ones you want if you're an audiophile and it doesn't stop there it just doesn't have to be compared to wireless headphones for any pair of headphones these are a good pair of headphones by any standard so with all these features drop is calling this the 3 P signal path because it combines that high bandwidth Bluetooth LD AC codec that zero distortion with a thx Triple A amplifier inside and the phase corrector playing our ribbon drivers this summit of they put the best of the best into these headphones now these do have that same distinct flavor that all planar magnetic head phones have which is they're a little bit on the dark richer side and I'm here for it amazing headphone definitely go back this up on IndieGoGo so you can get a deal on it for 320 bucks this is an easy cop for me especially if you are commuting if you're flying or even if you just want to listen to this in your home hands-free wireless free this is it chief alright guys it's been your boy bt don't forget to like share comment and subscribe and I will see you in the next video [Music]

Take control of your acoustic environment with Zone Wireless, the wireless headset specifically designed for busy workspaces. Connect it simultaneously to your smartphone and computer: great for talking, immersive for music, and active noise cancellation for when you just want to concentrate.",28,14629,16.0,102.0,5.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nfg56lD9eBQ/hqdefault.jpg,Logitech|productivity|creativity|product design|peripherals|interface design|technology interface|product engineering|design technology|Wireless headset|Bluetooth headset|best office headset|headphone/headset with ANC|open office headset|headphone with microphone,2020-10-07 10:22:47.663213," For many years Logitech has been making high-quality headsets. So when we decided to design a new headset for the workplace, we asked users to tell us about today's office and their pain points. They said the workplace has changed dramatically. Many have gone from private offices or cubicles to completely open floor plans. This creates busy, noisy, active environments that can be extremely distracting and often very hard to concentrate in. So we created an entirely new kind of headset. In Logitech, we always want to have a big idea behind the product We want to make this one not just a business tool, but your best companion throughout their workday. We came up with a solution that helps you collaborate, communicate and concentrate. It's much more than a call center headset. We leveraged over 30 years of our audio expertise so you can listen to music how the artist intended it. And hear perfect clarity on calls. We designed these microphones to capture your voice and your voice only thanks to dual microphones with a noise cancellation algorithm. Users asked for simple control so we made it easy to use. We created an interface that has only volume up, volume down, and one button to answer or end a call, or play or pause when you listen to music. You can pair it. You can adjust the volume up and down and you can go on mute all with one finger. It's designed to be so comfortable you can wear it all day. It's about the weight, the proportion, the angle, material finishing, and how people perceive that product. It's easy to set up. It's completely cordless with wireless charging. Our design team has spent an amazing amount of time to create a great looking headset that is discreet enough but helps you look good on any video call. Because looking from the screen on the other side of the world is your first impression. It's important. When you are done for the day, you fold it up and you put it away. It's created to help you focus in today's busy office environment. Or where ever your work day takes you. logitech®"

earphones|bluetooth earbuds|airpods|bose|bose 500|pixel buds|beats powerbeats|soundcore|sennheiser|jaybird,2020-10-07 10:22:47.663257, all right welcome to a long-term review of the Bose sound sport wireless headphones the color that I have here is aqua I've used them for nearly two years and so I guess that's a good time to do a very long-term review video for people who like to keep their stuff for a long time and then are looking for quality stuff that actually lasts a long time two years is a long time these days - especially for stuff like these for tech that go obsolete every other month you see new releases but both somehow stands up because of its quality so let's talk about what's good first and then they'll get what's not good and let's get to a final verdict on and the earphones itself so what's good right away you know both they're really good sounding your buds they have their own equalizer settings but they call something else they have a term for it but you don't have a separate equalizer unless you have an equalizer app on the phone acceptable as rapala phone but they sound really really good without any changes so number one they sound awesome number two the fit is actually pretty good so for someone who goes to work out and four runs I use it mainly for a running I used to use them for workouts as well on a daily basis but right now I have a have some other pair of earbuds that I use for gym and but for running though these are really good and the secure fit that the post your headphones come with these ones actually go in your ear pretty good they have three sizes and I think most people well for them it'll fit them properly so these fit really well for running outside running or on the treadmill and never come off until or unless you have water going in there because you're sweating a lot but that's that's the that's that's the true situation for every other earbuds on the market so that's one good second good thing third good thing the quality does the quality of the year buds itself for two years of use you they haven't changed much except there are some things I lost by using them really rough and then there are some things that I changed here the basic quality of the earbuds and the sound quality remains the same so I don't see any disadvantages with that the sound quality remaining the same I would say 99% close to whatever well it still does since I bought it but they're pretty good so that's number three number four do I even have them before number four I would say the point right now the advantage of the Pro for these headphones or they're going for a really less low price they even dip to sometimes one twenty Canadian which means you probably get it for 99 USD sometimes on this number right now they're going from 150 Canadian which would equate to around 119 USD so the price itself I think is a really good Pro here so if you're thinking of getting them right now even though it's been 2 years since these released I still think it's a good buy for the price for the sound for the fit and for the quality that bose offers now let's go to some disadvantages on this item so the number one disadvantage of this item is they're a little bit on the heavier end so when you have it in the ear and you're running a really high pace they seem to jiggle around a little bit not too much a little bit they don't come off but you still have that feeling where you know you have something in ears that's a little bit heavy and you might feel like they're coming off but again it has a secure fit right here for the ears plus you can clip this see I see that I used a plastic I'll get to the disadvantage second this plastic goes onto your shirt or your vest that you're wearing and so there won't really fall off that's actually an advantage should be honest wire around them and then number two there are some pieces that are falling off right now especially after 2 years of use I don't know if it's about as a disadvantage but definitely if you're wanting to use it for more than a year and a half you would see some other things fall off first thing first again the second disadvantage I would say is you see here I'd put some glue on there though the rubber where it to the plastic after one year it started coming off a little bit because you use this button quite so often you keep on hitting it and the glue comes off a little bit easy and you see it there's also something else here if I touch it it goes down so the glue that's coming off here as well so that's one of the gripes but I'm not really surprised after two years of use that it's coming off but they're still functioning even though I have a lot of sweat it doesn't really seem to affect it you could use some glue and stick this to take these ends off the super glue stuff you can stick these ends off and I think you should be fine and then there are other items that come off like these the both logo ones one of one of it came off I think that after I had had it thrown around for a while after using it renewed roughly that's being a little bit harsh on both but I think they I think it still functions properly well that's that's one of the gripes I will if I'm really nitpicking that's one of the gripes that some things are starting to fall off or come off so other than that the really minor disadvantage is at the clip that comes with bows actually if you're sweating and if there's there's liquid in it this clip will come off of the wire itself and if you're doing heavy lifting like let's say bench press and you're sleeping Bob you know you're you're laying down position you're doing a flat bench press you might press against this and this might break off and it happened to me once and I ordered two of these again from from boss and this is this this is the second thing that I'm using yeah but they're all as well but you see there's a small or tiny crack here I don't know if you can see it very well try to focus on here but there's a crack I think this might be coming off in the next few months as well but that's the great if you're sweating this will come off and then if you're doing bench presses have you bench presses or have you double press then this will start to crack so that's something to notify and then you see another thing that just came off is is this item right here so it's supposed to attach right here and just came off the other side it's it's still there but anyway those are the disadvantages from reading me picking what for the price it currently is when I bought them they're really expensive but right now for the price the value is very good so I would say a thumbs up for this one if you're trained thinking of buying them especially at the price right now wait for the Black Friday you'd see them dead 200 USD or 129 years Canadian and so I'd say that's a really good buy there you go guys that's a review please be sure to LIKE and subscribe and thank you

Advice:
If you want really good quality, you must also have a device that has a good sound card, because if you use a device with bad sound card, the sound will be bad, even with these good earphones.

10:22:47.663536, alright guys so I want to start this video with saying as a tech reviewer I get offers to try inexpensive Bluetooth wireless over the ear headphones all the time and I used to jump on those and then I got to a point where these are all starting to sound the same and they don't sound good at all so when the company ear fund wanted me to try out their new earphone wave I was hesitant at first but the thing I did remember was when I tried the earphone free which is their true Wireless earbud I was really impressed what they were able to do for 50 bucks so I was also wondering were they able to do the same thing for 50 dollars with a pair of wireless over-the-ear headphones so today we're gonna look at the earphone wave that only costs 50 bucks and right now on Amazon even has a 20% off coupon so you can pick them up for førde now guys one thing I do want to point out is ear fun also wanted to do a giveaway for you guys that is going on right now all the way till September 24th they're going to give away two pairs of these but all of that information is in the description so let's go ahead and check out some of the features and what's inside the box now speaking of the box the first thing I want to point out is the packaging is actually pretty similar to Sony's 1000x m3s like when you slide the Box out it has the flap that goes over the hard case which also surprised me the fact that it came with a hard case and a pretty nice one even though the case itself is really thick it's gonna take up a lot of space at your bag but it is pretty compact the headphones themselves followed up very nicely inside of them and it even has a compartment that's holding your three-and-a-half millimeter cable that it comes with and the dreaded microUSB cable which I'm going to try to look past because these are so inexpensive but again guys just include a USB C and then I won't even have to bring it up but speaking of the USB cable let's go ahead and talk about the battery the battery life on these are 40 hours which to me is really impressive especially considering like some of the bigger brands even the Sennheiser's that I reviewed yesterday that's a $400 pair of headphones and you're getting 17 hours of use so getting 40 is really impressive and on top of that if you pick them up and they're dead a ten-minute charge will give you two hours of use and I always welcome that because I can't tell you how many times I pick up a pair of headphones and they're dead now as far as the design and everything on the headphones the whole overall presentation is just simple it's not trying to do too much the outside is a matte black it's just plastic but it feels very smooth which does mean it also picks up a lot of fingerprints it has the aluminum slider inside so as far as finding the right adjustment you have lines as well to be able to match up on both sides now one concern I will say concern is they feel maybe even too light at times where it feels like they could be fragile now I can say that I could I've been able to bend these and extend these and they're fun but I think build quality is something I maybe would have liked to have seen a little more weight on but the headband has actually some pretty nice padding but again these are so light that they could have left off the padding and you probably wouldn't have known but the padding on the ear cups they are very deep and very soft and squishy but that's like the best way to describe it but when they're on your head they don't have like that tight clamping force they really do just kind of give way and feel so soft around your ears that was one of my favorite parts is how soft the ear pads were on these now again like I said as far as being simple it does have their logo and just like a chrome ring on both sides of the ear cups but for the most part this is a very simple looking design now one thing that I absolutely do not like is the way they did the charging port on the headphones it has this little flap that covers them I just think it looks cheap I think it's something that eventually is gonna break off and it's just inconvenient to have to kind of pull that thing off to charge the headphones now on the left hand side you do have the input for the headphone cable and then back on the right side is where all of your controls are located so play pause skip volume up and down everything is on the headphones themselves so one of the other things they added a noise rejecting microphone so for you guys that are on the go and like to take phone calls just by keeping your headphones on it's doing a pretty decent job but you guys can go ahead and listen to a test here alright guys so here is a mic test of the earphone wave this is just to show you what it would sound like if you were taking phone calls alright and here's the microphone with a crowd noise being played in the background just so you know what it would sound like if you were in a restaurant bar or a coffee shop so now I think what is the most important part is the sound I will say that I won't spend any money on something that just doesn't sound good like features and build quality and all that stuff is great but it really doesn't mean much if it sounds awful and again that's where I go back to most of those inexpensive Bluetooth headphones just sound like you're underwater they just there's something about them that sounds muffled and congested and they usually just don't handle bass very well and that's why I was really surprised with these I was surprised in the fact that one it had a very nice bass presence there's tons of base in these headphones but they were still able to keep them tight and clean it's not one of those that distorts which is another problem with most inexpensive headphones I was able to turn these up really loud and there was no distortion also with the treble it was very bright very clean everything just about these had a very nice presence but I still feel like the mids were pulled back too much I felt like in certain songs or in certain genres I just would have liked to have had the mids boosted a little bit more I don't like to ever feel like the vocals are trying to battle it out with the rest of the sound and just depending on what it was I was listening to I felt like at times I was doing that with these but again that still me trying to compare this with very expensive headphones in fact the sound signature on these are very very similar to the beats solo threes like really similar in fact that I would be kind of surprised if this isn't the same driver that's in the beats solo threes that they also shoved in the earphone weight so even if you want to look at it like that you can compare a 250 or $300 pair headphones - a pair of $50 and right now even $40 pair of headphones you see where I'm coming from but as far as the cons yea it picks up a lot of fingerprints I really hate that little flap I would have liked to have seen maybe a little more weight in the headphones just so it makes you feel better about bending them and knowing that you can kind of throw them around a little bit and they'll be okay and then in my opinion they needed to bump the mids up just a little I think the features I think the nice case the battery life and the sound that you're getting is worth way over the $50 price tag so guys that is my video on the ear fun wave wireless bluetooth headphones if you guys are interested like I said there is a giveaway that's going on to the 24th where you guys have a chance to win two pairs but all that info is in the description so thank you guys so much for checking out this video thank you so much for checking out all the other videos and as always make sure to

10:22:48.054309, alright guys so I want to start this video with saying as a tech reviewer I get offers to try inexpensive Bluetooth wireless over the ear headphones all the time and I used to jump on those and then I got to a point where these are all starting to sound the same and they don't sound good at all so when the company ear fund wanted me to try out their new earphone wave I was hesitant at first but the thing I did remember was when I tried the earphone free which is their true Wireless earbud I was really impressed what they were able to do for 50 bucks so I was also wondering were they able to do the same thing for 50 dollars with a pair of wireless over-the-ear headphones so today we're gonna look at the earphone wave that only costs 50 bucks and right now on Amazon even has a 20% off coupon so you can pick them up for førde now guys one thing I do want to point out is ear fun also wanted to do a giveaway for you guys that is going on right now all the way till September 24th they're going to give away two pairs of these but all of that information is in the description so let's go ahead and check out some of the features and what's inside the box now speaking of the box the first thing I want to point out is the packaging is actually pretty similar to Sony's 1000x m3s like when you slide the Box out it has the flap that goes over the hard case which also surprised me the fact that it came with a hard case and a pretty nice one even though the case itself is really thick it's gonna take up a lot of space at your bag but it is pretty compact the headphones themselves followed up very nicely inside of them and it even has a compartment that's holding your three-and-a-half millimeter cable that it comes with and the dreaded microUSB cable which I'm going to try to look past because these are so inexpensive but again guys just include a USB C and then I won't even have to bring it up but speaking of the USB cable let's go ahead and talk about the battery the battery life on these are 40 hours which to me is really impressive especially considering like some of the bigger brands even the Sennheiser's that I reviewed yesterday that's a $400 pair of headphones and you're getting 17 hours of use so getting 40 is really impressive and on top of that if you pick them up and they're dead a ten-minute charge will give you two hours of use and I always welcome that because I can't tell you how many times I pick up a pair of headphones and they're dead now as far as the design and everything on the headphones the whole overall presentation is just simple it's not trying to do too much the outside is a matte black it's just plastic but it feels very smooth which does mean it also picks up a lot of fingerprints it has the aluminum slider inside so as far as finding the right adjustment you have lines as well to be able to match up on both sides now one concern I will say concern is they feel maybe even too light at times where it feels like they could be fragile now I can say that I could I've been able to bend these and extend these and they're fun but I think build quality is something I maybe would have liked to have seen a little more weight on but the headband has actually some pretty nice padding but again these are so light that they could have left off the padding and you probably wouldn't have known but the padding on the ear cups they are very deep and very soft and squishy but that's like the best way to describe it but when they're on your head they don't have like that tight clamping force they really do just kind of give way and feel so soft around your ears that was one of my favorite parts is how soft the ear pads were on these now again like I said as far as being simple it does have their logo and just like a chrome ring on both sides of the ear cups but for the most part this is a very simple looking design now one thing that I absolutely do not like is the way they did the charging port on the headphones it has this little flap that covers them I just think it looks cheap I think it's something that eventually is gonna break off and it's just inconvenient to have to kind of pull that thing off to charge the headphones now on the left hand side you do have the input for the headphone cable and then back on the right side is where all of your controls are located so play pause skip volume up and down everything is on the headphones themselves so one of the other things they added a noise rejecting microphone so for you guys that are on the go and like to take phone calls just by keeping your headphones on it's doing a pretty decent job but you guys can go ahead and listen to a test here alright guys so here is a mic test of the earphone wave this is just to show you what it would sound like if you were taking phone calls alright and here's the microphone with a crowd noise being played in the background just so you know what it would sound like if you were in a restaurant bar or a coffee shop so now I think what is the most important part is the sound I will say that I won't spend any money on something that just doesn't sound good like features and build quality and all that stuff is great but it really doesn't mean much if it sounds awful and again that's where I go back to most of those inexpensive Bluetooth headphones just sound like you're underwater they just there's something about them that sounds muffled and congested and they usually just don't handle bass very well and that's why I was really surprised with these I was surprised in the fact that one it had a very nice bass presence there's tons of base in these headphones but they were still able to keep them tight and clean it's not one of those that distorts which is another problem with most inexpensive headphones I was able to turn these up really loud and there was no distortion also with the treble it was very bright very clean everything just about these had a very nice presence but I still feel like the mids were pulled back too much I felt like in certain songs or in certain genres I just would have liked to have had the mids boosted a little bit more I don't like to ever feel like the vocals are trying to battle it out with the rest of the sound and just depending on what it was I was listening to I felt like at times I was doing that with these but again that still me trying to compare this with very expensive headphones in fact the sound signature on these are very very similar to the beats solo threes like really similar in fact that I would be kind of surprised if this isn't the same driver that's in the beats solo threes that they also shoved in the earphone weight so even if you want to look at it like that you can compare a 250 or $300 pair headphones - a pair of $50 and right now even $40 pair of headphones you see where I'm coming from but as far as the cons yea it picks up a lot of fingerprints I really hate that little flap I would have liked to have seen maybe a little more weight in the headphones just so it makes you feel better about bending them and knowing that you can kind of throw them around a little bit and

headphones,2020-10-07 10:22:48.054345, hey guys welcome to another gaging gadgets review video in this video we have some wireless Bluetooth earbuds from ball tune these earbuds feature 16 hours of battery life they also have bluetooth 5.0 and they're ipx7 sweat proof and water resistant all that for about 22 dollars using the available coupon so check the link in the description to find that price let's go ahead and open them up and check them out they come in a nice cardboard box and I like that because you can recycle it well I'm getting these open just want to thank Bolton for sending me these headphones so I could test them thank you very much alright so it looks like we have another flap to open on top we have some support information the actual headphones right here I'll put them aside see what else is in the box we have some spare earbud tips as well as your wings a very small charging cable which is standard USB to microUSB a carrying case that is really nice has some good protection to it this is similar to the cases that are provided by anchor and then finally we have a user's manual I'll go ahead and get the headphones out of the bag so right off the bat you can see that they have a magnetic design really cool I love when headphones have that it makes it much easier to use one at a time or to simply just wrap them around your neck when you're not using them come with some plastic that protects them so the earbud here seems to be metal on the outside and it's kind of a shiny metal so it'll be a little bit flashy then it's a plastic going on to two different pieces that can be removed and changed on the earbud so first you have the earbud tip and this is all a very soft material it feels like rubber and then you have the ear wing right here and this goes inside your ear lobe to ensure that the earbud is stabilized so really you have these two very soft rubbers that'll fit in your ear and hopefully be nice and comfortable these can all be changed out with the different sizes that were provided in this bag each earbud here has a right and left indicator located on the ear wing you can see that L right there and the R right there and there are no buttons or anything like that located on the actual earbuds the buttons are all going to be down the cable on the little dongle here so as you can see you have three buttons the middle is going to be a multi functional button that will be used to pause and play audio you can also turn on and turn off the headphones with this button as well as answer and hang up on phone calls then you have a plus and a minus button this will be the volume control as well as track control and then it looks like you have a little LED that kind of just provide the status of the earbuds so if they're in pairing mode if they're on and then on the side of the dongle you have a micro USB connector for charging the earbuds and it has this little rubber gasket to ensure that they are sweat proof the dongle also has a nice bull tune logo on the back pretty cool the cable is a very soft material so I don't think you'll have any issues with this rubbing on your skin if you wear it behind your head or on the back of your neck anything like that it also is flat so usually that means that they do not tangle very easily so really that's it on the Bolton earbuds you have the dongle with the controls you have the magnetic design and then the two removable pieces on each earbud now that we've taken a closer look at the Bolton earbuds let's go ahead and turn them on and then we'll get them paired with my phone so I'll turn them on and put them in pairing mode by just holding down the power button until we see the blue and red light blinking all right they're in pairing mode they come up by phone as Bolton BTB H 0 0 1 and we're connected as you can see they came fully charged which is always a nice touch alright so as you can see I'm currently wearing the Bolton earbuds right here and all the audio you're hearing right now is coming from the microphone located on the dongle right here so hopefully this will give you a good idea of what the microphone sounds like if you're gonna be placing calls with these or if you're going to be connecting them to a computer or game console or in game chat or discord additionally I hope this gives you a good idea of what they look like Warren one thing I definitely like about the magnetic design is that it makes it really easy to wear only one at a time because you can take one out and then connect it to the other one via the magnet and you still have the usage of the microphone if you want to if you want to be on a call or you can just listen to music and you still have one ear open to anybody around you that wants to talk to you alright so as you just heard the microphone on the Bolton earbuds was actually extremely high quality I would say you'd have no problem placing calls with these and it would actually be okay to use this in conference calls or in game chat if you're going to be using this with a console or on your PC now additionally I also like the audio quality out of these I found it to be extremely clear and the highs and the mids came through very powerfully with no tininess at all the lows while the bass was a little bit lacking it was still there and it was an enjoyable listening experience so really there was no problem and the listening experience was very enjoyable I also found no issues when I was watching YouTube or anything on my phone there was no problem with the audio being out of sync with the video the Bluetooth range is about 30 feet which is pretty normal for Bluetooth and you can actually sync to different devices at the same time now you only hear one device at a time but as soon as one goes silent and you start playing another one it'll start playing it through the earbuds so very cool how seamless that was and how well it worked the dongle right here works very well the microphone was obviously very good but the buttons are very responsive it's easy to find it because it's hanging down right near your face and the LED is very easy to see it's very easy to see if they're on and if you've left them on so you know have to worry about draining down your battery there either and then lastly I really like the magnetic design like I showed you in the video it's really cool to be able to wear one at a time and still use the microphone so if you wanted to be on a call and still be able to have some awareness around you by having just one earbud in you do have that option I also found them to be extremely comfortable like I said you have the rubber on the earbud you also have the rubber on the piece that goes inside the earlobe so it's very soft does not bother you after you've been wearing it for a long period of time such as a couple hours so really I wasn't able to find a lot of negatives with these maybe just look at lacking a little bit when you're listening to more bass dependent music but like I said it was not that big of a problem and on top of all that I think they have a really good looking design so they look great when you're wearing them so those are the Bolton Bluetooth earbuds if you've any questions about this device leave a comment below I'll get back to you as soon as I can I'm going to add an Amazon affiliate link

is sponsored by direct mobile so check out their deals at direct mobile skoda at UK so welcome to my review of the adidas sport headphones now there are two sets of added us headphones to choose from you can have the in-ear type or the over-the-air type they're both designed for your workout and I'm going to do a separate video about the earbuds because both of these really do sound great and they both deserve a separate video but for now this one is going to be about the over-the-air headphones now these set of headphones will set you back about 140 pounds and I think it is safe to say that most people would assume that adidas branded set of headphones are just gonna be pretty bog-standard when it comes to the engineering itself and the style would be the only thing that they really got going but this is more of a collaboration analyst have clearly done the styling but the headphones themselves are made by a Swedish company called the South who are known for producing high quality audio products I think I so clearly styled these to go with their primeknit range even the unboxing experience is kind of like unboxing a pair of trainers with this paper wrapping and yes since I've got these headphones I have kind of been thinking about investing in a pair now to give them their full name these are the adidas our PTO ones and with these were getting up to 40 hours of playback time which is a good few days of hard use and on top of that superfast USB type-c charging these headphones are extremely lightweight and comfortable which is probably thanks to the unusual knitted woolen material wrapped around the tubular frame I think that this star will not appeal to everyone it's definitely a street kind of look but it definitely works for me and it's not too bulky the material is removable and washable thankfully as it is bound to get dirty fairly quickly the only reservation I have about the fabric is that it might start to fray and bubble over time but at least if it does you know that your crown will be able to knit you a new one if it really is a lot to like about these headphones it's just they're very well made even though you you might think that they're not judging from the material when you get them in your hand they do feel the good quality even though they're quite light the tubular frame is made from us quite a nice matte finish plastic and there's a ridged rubber band that goes inside of the headband that has the added s logo on one side if you look on it in a band there's a little time telling you which one is left and which one is right and they're easily adjustable by just pushing the cups up and down these are definitely a fully-loaded self can I do like the control system on the right cup there is a little joystick you can push it up or down to control the volume push it in to start or stop the music or push it left and right to skip tracks I find the sound quality to be excellent rich and nuanced plenty of bass but not too much they it buries everything else you get clear mid-range and sharp tops as well it's just all around a really nice rich and clear sound bluetooth 5.0 gives a strong connection it will be available straight away in your Bluetooth menu but if you download the added s app you get a few different sound profiles as well as access to a graphic equalizer to create your own as well as the joystick type control on the right Cup on the left cup there is an action button within the app you can customize what functions you want to add to the action button and you can also connect up your Spotify account to get instant access to your selected playlists customize it how you want I've got the single press to activate voice assistant and double press and triple press to access my Spotify playlist I find out when making calls with these headphones although the voice comes through crystal clay you can't really fault it at all I can't really hear myself talk so I feel like I'm showering when I have them on which I probably am but that's probably more mindful than the headphones even my dad says that the call comes through crystal clear when I speak to him and he's always complaining about the quality of the phone line these are ipx4 rated so you won't have no problems with them getting soaked in sweat or if you're ever caught in the rain and it s really have capital bases here the only one feature that's missing is pass-through audio but you can find that feature in the in air version of these which I'll be doing a review of very soon or if you're watching this in a few days is up on the channel great but overall I really love these headphones I've got quite a few different pairs in for review at the moment but I keep going back to these ones because of the sound quality they just sound amazing on top of it they look really good looks great sounds great super fast charging from just five minutes charging you can get a good couple of hours play from this if you were thinking about buying these but you was a little bit worried that because they're by adding tasks they're not going to sound very good well taken from me these are a very nice set of headphones and come highly recommended I have to say my only reservation weekís headphones is probably the thing that is most attractive about and that's the material that they've used around it yeah it does look great now but I'm worried how it's gonna look in six months times a year's time ya know it's washable I'm just conscious that it's not going to look as good as it does when it was new and I always seem to have that in the back of my mind and I'm very careful with them even though they are quite sturdy you are able to twist that tube the frame quite easily and it just always pops back to its normal shape other than that these are great and I'm really enjoying using before I go I want to tell you about the Barrett Mobile's website it really is a great place to look if you're in the market for a new phone you can go there and compare all of the available deals with all of the UK networks to make sure that you're going to find the best deal plus they have over 24 years of a ward winning customer service their link is in the video description below or search direct mobile stock code that UK also down in the description is a link to a new detect Amazon shop where you'll find all the best tech or recommended by us is definitely worth checking out and that's it for me I hope you enjoyed this video look out for my review about the inner versions of these the fw0 ones plus a lots more news and reviews on the way follow me on facebook instagram and twitter is at v-tex thank you for watching guys and i'll see in the next video my name's David this is BJ [Music]

[Music] on the screen right now I'm actually a couple of different features of that phone one of which was the lack of the headphone jack which since iPhone 7 apples taken out of your phones now there's been a lot of controversy over that and Apple's released a lot of dongles but I personally are not funds that I think they're just hockey fan and so I decided since I was in a meeting I flew Yacktman 8 or X as the personal one for the next year so hey let's invest in Wireless next one so I did a little bit of research turns out Apple is releasing brand new studios needless to say I go to my hands and song installed it all further ado present and all new Beats Studio 3 wireless headphones [Music] all right so just looking at the blocks it looks pretty nice this is of course the special edition box that uses eyes as I mentioned earlier to beat studio three Wireless these actually come in six different colors I do have the shadow gray hair right now but this also comes in blue porcelain rose matte black white and red but I personally like the shadow great the best so that's what I have here so looking around the box so just a couple of features listed on the back which I'll be talking about in a sec and picture of the beat so just slightly in the sky gold beats logo right there so I'm gonna go ahead and open it up and yeah we do see the case right here which comes with these headphones looks pretty nice just gonna go through the rest of the ball this is the fast fuel charge linen cord so the cool thing about this is ten minutes of charge actually gets you three hours of playback which is really cool if you you know have your headphones dead and you're in order to get some just looking through the rest of the clocks we of course have the three millimeter headphone cord here which isn't going to be too useful if you have the iPhone a drive-in acts of course but for like other phone users like Samsung or even like the laptops this could come in very handy so I'm just gonna set that aside also and not really sure what this is looks like some clip of some sort so I'm just gonna set that aside so moving the box this side now focus on the actual headphones well this case looks really nice and most like you're gonna use this a lot wow these look really nice I was actually worried at first they might be tad bit too big but honestly they look really nice there's a sticker here which I'm just gonna peel off thank you ladies and gentlemen the all-new Beats Studio 3 Wireless head the shadow recolor of course looks very nice fluent beats clean D we designed this a little bit so I didn't see overall build looks a lot nicer and Mike looks really smooth and shiny today of course maintain the design over here that lets you play by hidden this and you know you can go volume up volume down by doing that or changing tracks by clicking left and right so that looks nice I'll stick over here which I'm just going to take off the charging ports right here the port of course if you choose to use a wired connection for this so just talking about the features of this as pure ENC which I mentioned earlier which is actually pure active noise cancellation so that actually cancels out blocks out a lot of external noise who's done a really good job at this this year especially with the addition of the w1 chip which is also you're not allowing to connect really quickly to your devices so long as they're running on newer iOS versions of course people love other non Apple phones like androids or whatever of course gonna have to go through the traditional process of pairing headphones really like Bluetooth settings and whatnot so what else is that tell me on fascicle charge which gives you three hours of playback from just 10 minutes or charges I mentioned earlier it also features real-time audio calibration to improve your listening so Bates actually claims these will have 22 hours of battery life so actually turn off the ante gives you more listening alright so just moving to the pairing process I did mention earlier that these headphones actually have apples neww on chipping off the big things with that actually is um parent so basically all you need to do is actually just turn the Bluetooth on your phone and then there's a power button right here and then all you need to do is just hold that to turn the headphones on and it automatically pops up on your screen all you do is hit connect and that should be it so now you can see it's connected to the Beats Studio threes and yeah you can go ahead and listen I'm just gonna move on says listen experience and also saying out these actually fit so Mike is gonna put these on now I've had a bit of a reservation on how they might actually fit just because they're a bit bigger than you know you're a regular headphones what I like the solos for instance so I'm kind of curious to see how it fits I'm just going to go ahead and listen to a song chest up you know the sound quality is great the one small thing I'm going to mention though is they're pretty big so that it might just be something you want to pay attention to before actually bind these to actually make sure they fit well those of you wondering these are actually gonna set you back 399 here in Canada so if you're not that price maybe I have to see they're pretty worth that you know the quality like I just said is really good and the fits nice long thanks for watching guys if y'all gonna already subscribed feel free to do so right now and I'll see you guys [Music] push me to

tutorial|monitor|beats|Making beats|bluetooth|iphone|ios,2020-10-07 10:22:48.054538, what's going on is this Kareem from DJ booth net and I'm hearing aloud to give you guys a quick review video of the new III TM a to HD Wireless and HD wired over the ear headphones so what we have here is the newest addition of the tma-2 headphones from III we also reviewed the TMA ones years ago then we reviewed the original tma-2 s and what the tma-2 is all around is a modular style headphone meaning you can customize these to exactly how you want them you can change the headband for different materials that you see fit you can also change the different cables if you want to coiled cable professional cables or if you want like a smart phone cable they have all of those options here for you you can also change the ear cups themselves so the ear pads either sit right on the ear like these leather ones we have here or they can fit completely over the ear like these microfiber ones that we have here or you can also get ones that just actually fit your ears better than what the other ones may suggest different materials and so on and so forth and you can also change the speaker units so you can get the sound signature that you want my original speaker units that I got in the original tma-2 s I believe of the Esso twos and those are great for a heavy bass because I kind of like heavy bass so that's what we had on our originals now in steps the tma-2 HD and the HD wireless when you order these they're $2.99 for the regular HD that does not include any bluetooth you'll get a all plastic headband as with the other plastic III construction but they do have really good durability they don't creak they don't pop they don't snap in any way very very durable even though they're all plastic all the way around and that's usually one of my gripes with headbands and headphones is that I usually like to have some metal in there but these have last four years so these are definitely going to hold up to the abuse of a DJ but again when you get these in the HD version non-wireless version you have a nice Alcantara headband underneath with memory phone very soft very very comfortable for long hours of use and then when you get these and the wireless version you'll get a bluetooth-enabled headband that gives you three different buttons here for volume up volume down and skipping between your tracks and answering phone calls and you also have a nice rubberized style of very soft headband underneath so that way it fits on the top of your head very nicely and it doesn't really give you any type of super weight compared to the non battery and non wireless version the battery on these headbands do last for 18 hours of playback use we tested that and we did get the full 18 hours as they described and they definitely feel pretty light even when compared to the other not much of a weight difference when it goes to that but the cost difference again is 50 bucks so it's up to you to decide whether you want that wireless version or the wired version when using wired or wireless version the ear cups to the actual speaker units have outlets on each side so you can always use a cable with them even if you don't want to use the wireless versions and wireless mode you'll always have a backup solution with the cable that comes included with it when you get the HD Wireless you do get a nice professional cable here it really feels really good to the touch it's nice and coated with this nice material to really make them feel like they're very professional they also come with a screw on quarter inch adapter and the side that plugs into your ear cup twists and locks in place so that way it can't be yanked out very easily the III tma-2 Wireless also come with two cables of course they come with a USB C charging cable and that actually fits right up inside of the headband it's kind of funny to get it kind of in there just right but it's nice and secure when you do get it in there and it's nice and stealthy actually where they placed it so I don't mind that at all and the construction again it's all plastic construction all the way around but when you're getting the HD versions you're also getting these new Alcantara ear cups and they have really nice soft plush memory foam my original III tma-20 fiber and they almost look identical but the new ones are actually thicker and they actually have way better memory foam meaning when I press this down they stay kind of indented for a while you can actually see it kind of growing back out again whereas when I'm using my micro fibers you don't have that same plush effect they do take a little bit of time to spring out but it comes out a lot faster than it does for these ultra comfortable Alcantara set on the Left which are the actual HD Wireless you're also getting new speaker units when you get the HD Wireless or the HD wired they're the so8 speakers that you can find on the I website they're nice HD sound meaning you get a good balance with the mids the lows in the highs my so2 which were bass heavy don't give you the same reproduction on the highs and on the mids but I actually like the bass more and these than I do and the Esso eighths but if you want to all-around loud and good and crisp sound then the S eights are the ones that you guys are gonna want that's what you get with the HD units again the wireless versions come in a cost of 350 you have all the aptX technology that you need in these so you're getting a very crisp signal from your source material and it sounds just as good when using these with the cable when you're not using them with a cable it always sounds about the same and we have again the regular HD wired versions these sound very good they feel very good on the head and it's just up to you whether or not you want to spend that extra money in order to get the wireless configuration so in conclusion the III tma-2 HD wireless and HD wired versions definitely have good construction all around they are all plastic but they're definitely going to live up to the abuse because they're made very very well and are definitely made to last the III tma-2 is also very very customizable meaning you can change between different ear cuffs you can change between different speaker units to get the sound you definitely want and you can get the different headbands and the different cables so that way it makes it just for you exactly how you wanted them they're also very lightweight and comfortable and the HD version gives you a nice new Wireless headband that has 18 hours of playback and the Bluetooth functionality is very very good as well and they give you them brand new so8 speakers that actually give you a nice HD style sound that are very very crisp and sounds good and all the full range of frequencies from the lows the mids and the highs on the downside at 300 to $350 I'm surprised it didn't come with some type of bag or case usually at that price point you get some type of holding device so that way you can hold these and bring them with you on the go and as always with iit ma headphones they don't have any real swivel feature or any collapsible feature so that way you can have one ear on and one ear off monitoring or you can make them down into a smaller form factor for travel use so for more on the review you guys can head on over to DJ booth net / DJ s so you could type in III you can see all of our review videos right there from all of the TMA lineups make sure you guys hit the thumbs up if you like videos

10:22:48.054605, hello it applause and welcome back to my IT workshop so in this video I'm going to do a quick review for these wireless headphones Skullcandy Reef Wireless and I've been looking for a world lit wireless headphones for a long time now I mean I'm using a regular with court headphones I'm going to leave the link in the description below if you're curious they are really good but I wanted something Wireless so this one has 12 hours battery life which is really really good and if you charge them for around 10 minutes you're going to have do you have you can have them working for around 2 hours so that's pretty cool in my opinion so I'm going to use these more for my desktop computer not not much for my cell phone or all that because I like to use it I spend a lot of a lot of time off my desktop so here we are we open the box and now we're going to open this little box so you can see here this one is charged using a micro USB I I wish these were USBC but that's not the case but that's not bit of a deal then we have the 2 year global warranty that's pretty cool now we're going to check the instructions which I'm going to show you later you can see there and now we're going to check the actual headphones so as you can see here this color is grey and green there are many colors of course this is not the only one but this is the one I chose for this one now this has it has this plastic cover you can like any other headphones you can adjust the size for your head so that's that's kind of well that's standard let's say now I'm going to take out these plastic covers and I'm going to show you how it looks these headphones also have a microphone built-in so that's really good too I don't use much the microphone to be honest because I already have a good microphone but that's a bird for example when you are on a cell phone if you're going to use it for a cell phone or for a tablet it's really good to have and you can fold it like I'm doing in the video if you are going to go for a walk if you have to go to school or to university or something like that out of real going for a walk I'm real light but I also what I like a lot is that there is super comfortable on the ears so that's really good this is one I use actually the blue ones with orange and I've been using these for about one month and I don't have any complain about this it's really good I bought the the silver one for my office so I don't have to take them to work and then I might forget it I come back a I forgot my headphones so that's why I have these two so again it's very comfortable on the ear on the years this very very breeze of material and that's something that for me is very very important now what we are going to do next is I'm going to I'm going to still show you around how they look they have many other colors like like I mentioned a few a few seconds ago and now since this is going to be for my desktop I don't have Bluetooth built-in in my desktop computer that's why I bought these Wireless well this USB bluetooth adapter I believe it cost like six dollar five dollars and going to lean I'm going to leave the link to Amazon in the video description as well so it's really quick you just connect it and after a few seconds you have a Bluetooth that's not big of a deal if you are doing this on a laptop or cell phone you don't need these of course so these are the instruction very straightforward if you press it for five seconds it's going to turn on it's going to blink the lights going to blink to pair and then you have these other options like the track back track forward the volume if you press it once it's going to answer a call and if you want to activate voice assist and in my case would be Cortana you have to press fast two times so that's pretty cool if you are on a cell phone whether it's Android or Apple is going to trigger the voice at the virtual assistant as well so it's very straightforward to follow is really easy to use I like it a lot because of that way that that's one of one of the reason I like a lot of now I'm going to show you I'm going to keep it the phrase for about five seconds and as you can see it's on now so it's in pair mode so it's blinking like in like it says in the extra instructions so it has only three buttons the one in the center and the volume up and volume down so as you can see here I'm testing it and what we're going to do now since I'm in Windows I'm going to connect it to this computer so here we are as you can see the icons are a little bigger so you can see it better so I'm going to type settings and I'm going to choose that option and then we're going to go to devices we click on it and the Bluetooth since it's already connected the USB Bluetooth adapter I don't have to do anything else it's you don't have to sell it or anything it's automatic and then I go to add Bluetooth devices so Bluetooth and it's going to look for the headphones there you go breathe wireless so I'm going to take a few seconds to pair it and that's it that was really fast the videos not to speed up or anything that was quick so as you can see I have two the one I just bought which is the silver and the other which is this the blue and orange so I don't have anything else to do here so we're going to go back to the headphones itself well themselves so as you can see here it's blinking and now it's blinking blue so that means it's pair and that the device is it's on it tells you on the headphones you can you're going to listen something like pair or something like that so you know it's better so now we are going to to see the instructions I don't know not instruction I'm sorry we're going to listen to some music so you can see how how it sounds alright so allow me a few seconds while I'm trying to do that so here we go [Music] [Applause] [Music] so there you go that was that was playing some classical music the maximum volume that's how it sound so when you go to David to the limit is going to blink even it's not going to it's going to make like a bit telling you hey this is the max volume and when you go down it's going to make another beep saying hey this is the low as we can go so it has good sound you have heard that is good I believes good volume is poor it's never a good idea to have the highest volume because you're going to damage your ears now another thing one drawback which I would say if you're going to choose these to make cardio for example is not advisable I try it and it makes your ears a little hot and you're going to be sweaty and all that it's not advisable to that it's for walking maybe or to stay at home well now when I'm at home I I just put it on my neck and I walk around if I'm listening to music or something like that it has a really good range I would say that that's another thing like a lot for the charge that I think it's very very short I already had this long charger about 1 meters or what how much how many mean like 3 feet something like that when the battery is is low I just connected and I can still use it so but but that's I'm not saying that super inconvenience I'm just telling you I already had the cable so that's what I wanted to show you this video oh by the way this video is not sponsored or anything I just look for I just need it I just want it to change really my headphones too for wireless ones and I wanted to buy something that is really comfortable good quality but it's not super expensive like I don't know $300 or $100 or something like that so that's why I've made the city so thank you very own you the microphone there I maybe I forgot to show it before but that's what I wanted to show you this video guys so I'm going to leave the link in the description below if you liked this video please leave a like and subscribe if you have any other comment or questions leave them in the comment section below and as always I'll see you in the next video [Music]

drivers so expect battery long battery life as well as bluetooth 4.0 for corn activities a little bit older than blue 25.0 but both of them differ my new lee now to power on and power of the earbuds is only one way which is taking off the case and putting back into the case i wish at this price point since it has the button right here a long press on the button would actually power on or power off since it has internal storage which we'll cover in a later bit the good news is on this true while it's a bus right here you can control the volume easily without the need to access your well smartphone the left side is lowering the volume the right side right here is to increase the volume so okay now this baby's right here do not have active noise cancellation but when it comes to the peso sound isolation meaning the physical highway alone it's amazing because it goes deep into the ear canal and blocking a lot more of the environmental noises i feel it blocks more than its more premium brother which is the true wireless 1000x mark tree which i cover in the previous review and one thing about this ear tips is because it's designed for swimming you can adjust the ear tips whether you want to push it inwards or outwards so it can even block the environmental noise more or even prevent the liquid going into your ears so something to note right there this true wireless device right here features a four gig onboard memory where you can store up to 900 songs without being connected to the smartphone this means it helps with battery life longer battery life obviously and you can not bring your smartphone to get destructor just focus on your running your sports and your other lifestyle activities instead the rate of battery life is three hours when the pair is used together the charging case gives additional chav hours hour battery life test is based on the Samsung S 10 e at the fourth volume bar we managed to get a total of 13 hours and 45 minutes now for audio quality test for Papa Indian I choose can be okay low base frequency is superbly energetic and superbly notable you can feel the air pressure movement in your ears significantly lower base does overpower the vocals in terms of audible level but not much vocal surprisingly sounds sharp and not muffled sound for PR me I do again the bass is highly energetic in highly notable the base fits to first and a two minute and five seconds of the song the vibrations is little or barely noticeable the bass does not overpower the vocals it feels like balance a little bit right here EDM tone sounds alive and highly energetic for vocals and instrumentals I choose violin the raindrop the piano and a varying tone is the warm sounding type and not the crystal killer type I prefer the crystal type alone it needs more shine at the highest the drum does overpower the piano and violin significantly that is not how the song is intended to be when it comes to patter Tony see true when it comes to Mitch grasses high-pitched male channel because it performed decently at a height great amount of shine is needed at the highest every diction and pronunciation it feels a little bit soft and maybe a little bit muted right here what could be boxing echoing and humming is great but that's overpower Mitch Garcia's vocal in a song and the main vocals basically lose focus right here so here's my take on this true wireless air bus right here this one is more on the bass heavy it performs well from the lows to the upper mids where its core strength is more on the EDM pop and BC type of songs so if you're a refined person you may want to jump on the sony true Wireless which is the 1000 X mark tree that is more for the refined people who is listening to vocals acapella and instrumentals this one is for the energetic fight right here it has the four gig onboard memory right here where you can store song so you can listen without the need of smartphone well you cannot bring a smartphone in a swimming pool or saltwater if not you're going this appear so it works as intended to be when I recommend this as a sports earbuds right here at this price is a bit hard to swallow but if you're looking for this necessary features definitely this would be a first priority right here for running I would say but for those dreamers I would say yeah thanks for watching this video if you're interested in this babies right here links in a video description where you can get them including the update the price remember like the subscribe and share this video on social media we need the necessary views to get 20,000 subscribers by yeah and till then I'll see you guys in the next Sony review"

10:22:48.054649, [Music] greetings and welcome back everybody to a new video so I have finally decided to upgrade to a violence Bluetooth headset so I picked up the Sony WH XP 700 this is from their extra base headphone lineup so in this video what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna review these headsets and I'm gonna show you how it looks like how it works and then I'm gonna tell you how these sound quality is like alright so this is the box in which the headset comes out so a quick look at the back this is how the headphone looks like by the way and we've got hands-free calling with the HD voice obviously it's called a microphone on board ten minutes of charge playback up to 90 minutes and then 30 hours of continuous music playback voice assist compatible with Google app and Siri and it charges through USB type-c and it's what I headphone cable why because this thing can be operated passively so in case you run out of charge you can use these passively by plugging in a headphone cable but yeah you can't really do that on your phones because yeah no more headphone jack so this is one of the reasons why I am upgrading to this anyways that's it get out of the box by the way this one is also compatible with Google assistant and it's got alexa built in and yes this only bluetooth headset will work with iPhone iPod Android Windows PC or a Mac and provided Windows PC has bluetooth onboard anyways let me get the headset out of the box and we will see what all stuff is supplied inside the box right so here Rd do to protect I look nice this is the blue color so this is what you get inside the box first off we have a USB type-c charging cable the three-and-a-half millimeter headphone cable to operate this passively and then we have the Quick Start Guide and the user manual also inside the box it shows you that you should download the Sony headphone connect app and you don't really need this this is not mandatory by the way but still go ahead and download this app on your phone so now let us take a look at the headset itself by the way you get this in two colors blue and black I picked up the blue color also do keep in mind the XP 700 does not have active digital noise cancellation so whatever noise is going to be blocked as the cause of this foam pad around the earpiece cup and I have already done some testing at the Sony store the noise cancellation is quite ok it's not as good as active digital noise cancellation but it's fairly decent considering you don't have active noise cancellation also the design is slightly different by the way these speakers or like this you can keep it on the table Sony's design language has also changed a little bit compared to the older headsets so this is the sony MDR XP 450 so this was their previous design language quite flashy and this is the newer design language not that flashy and kind of looks more professional compared to the old one but to be honest if you asked me I do like the order design language I like this metal thingy effect but this is plastic indeed just like this one enjoying the content well make sure to subscribe and do press that Bell icon so that you can get notifications to my latest uploads let's continue so coming back to our XP 700 you can see these speakers are clearly labeled left and right then the pan which goes around the head this one is nice and soft so this one is padded and I think this is leather it's nice and soft and if I then these you can see this is metal and it does become quite big so even if you have a big head this one will fit without any problem and because of the metal band the build quality of the headset is quite good although it does feel a little plasticky because of this plastic but I don't really think this will break easily especially when you have a metal metal band that goes around like this overall I do like the build quality feels nice and solid and we've got the Sony branding over here got Sony branding on either side it'll look at the buttons so this is your USB type-c charging port the headphone jack connector so you can use these passively the microphone and we've got the power button the custom button to activate Alexa or Google assistant then we have the volume buttons plus n minus a pause and forward button is over here forward or rewind and this is on the right side so the right side has the volume buttons and the power button is only left also xb 700 has NFC so the NFC is over here for easy pairing now pairing the xB 700 is super duper easy all you have to do is turn the headset on wait for the led to blink so right now it is in pairing mode and all you have to do is grab your phone make sure NFC is turned on and just have the back of your phone onto the headphone like this and it says parity Bluetooth device yes and this LED should stop blinking like this okay and that is it the headset is now paired with the Samsung Galaxy Note 1000 if you want to pair the headset with another smartphone well if your smartphone has NFC you can just have the back of the phone to the headset and it will pair automatically otherwise if you want to do manual pairing of any headset is turned on press and hold the power button for about seven seconds and you will see this LED will start blinking now the headset is in pairing mode so to do manual pairing turn on bluetooth go to Bluetooth settings so available devices pairing okay and that is it it has now paired with another smartphone but I do recommend that you used NFC because it is a lot easier to pair and unpair using NFC it's just one tap it will get disconnected see now it's disconnected one tap it will get connected automatically see that it is now connected so now let me show you the functionality of all these buttons which are on your headset so first off you can see this is the right side and this is the left so you will be pushing your headphones on like this so that means the volume control buttons will be on your right so these are your volume controls plus and minus and the middle one is prayer pause so press at once the music starts playing then this is to decrease the volume and just first increase the volume now if you double press the middle button this will switch over to the next song again double press switches to the next song now if you press this three times it goes back to the previous song again three times it goes back to the previous song press it once it stops playing pauses the music press it once again it starts playing these are all your music controls over here by the way this one also answers the call so now if we give myself a phone call so you guys can see I am getting a phone call to answer the call I just have to press this button once and that answers the call to end the call press this once and they call the end you can see the call has ended the music playback resumes so that's how these buttons function now moving on to the left side this is the button this custom button s for google assistant so let me quickly demonstrate the google assistant functionality so cup my xiaomi bedside table lamp here this one is connected to Wi-Fi so press and hold the custom button to give google assistant commands turn on bedside lamp check that out that is awesome now if you press this once and release the google assistant will read out your time and it will tell you if you have any notifications so in case you have any notifications the Google assistance would actually read that out for you this is your power button press and hold to turn the power off see that turns the power off if I want to turn the headphones on press and hold the upper kurds on so it is SuperDuper easy to operate this you can see it has automatically connected to the phone if you press the power button once it will tell you the battery level of the headset I'm gonna do that again near the camera battery only charged and then over here we have the USB type-c and the headphone jack now in case your battery runs out or if you want to use these passively with a wire you can also do that so you have a three and a half millimeter headphone jack over here so right now the headset is turned on the LED is blinking as soon as I plug in the wire this kills the Bluetooth functionality so the headset will get disconnected Bluetooth turns off and now I can use these passively like a normal headset so that's it all you need to do is connect and hear song and it will work no problem you can hear the sound it may be music coming [Applause] so this is the passive functionality of these headphones I think this is quite a nice touch in case your battery runs out you can just plug in your cable and still enjoy the music so let me give you guys a quick demo of how these headsets unlike especially the clear piece although I don't really think this sound recorder will be able to capture the full depth in the quality of these headphones so anyways we'll give this a try right now the level is low [Applause] so I hope that gives you guys an idea on how these headphones sound light if bass is awesome I don't think this recorder will be able to capture the full depth of the sound but these headphones do sound quite nice so now let me show you how they look like when you are wearing them okay so this is how the headset looks like when you wear them now they do look a little big and heavy at first glance but they really are not that big or heavy these are medium sized headsets although they are definitely heavier than your regular non bluetooth headset but hey they do feel quite comfortable to wear I bought them for an hour and a half during my commute and no they did not cause any discomfort and the nice thick foam around the earpiece cup does block pmf noise and I also like to wear my hat when I'm outside so these headphones are big enough to accommodate that no problems now coming to the sound quality I would say that the sound quality of the whx b700 is great for the price when I was testing these I did not use any equalizer and the clear base was set to level 5 that seems to be the sweet spot with these headset and with this sort of a setting the headset retains mids and highs even at higher volumes and there is a good level of bass although I do recommend keeping the volume below 50% if you value your ears as these do tend to get quite loud also there is no distortion skipping or lacks speaking of skipping the range is also quite good I have not experienced any disconnection issues I can roam about in my room without having any connection issues on this headset so concluding thoughts I would say that the xB 700 is a great wireless stereo Bluetooth headset it gives you a good balance between price and some quality with great battery backup although I do recommend that you go to Sony Center and try it out yourself before purchasing them because everyone has different preferences and hey if you like a lot of bass then turn off that clear based setting and enjoy your music with a ton of punchy bass and lastly if I have to pick one thing that I don't like about this headset well that is the plastic and it makes the headset feels less expensive than including yes Sony has done a better job on their older design especially the one on the MDR XD 450 but hey it's a personal choice I personally seem to prefer the old design compared to the new one and check this out my razor playstation chroma also doubles up as a charging stand for my new sony wireless headphones pretty darn awesome right alright so I guess that pretty much wraps it up for this video if you guys have any questions about the xB 700 and let me know in the comments below and I'll try and reply to you guys and by the way I recharge the battery on Friday I guess Friday afternoon and right now it is Sunday morning Sunday early morning it is 256 a.m. yeah so it is Sunday and my battery level is still 100% so this headphone does have a pretty darn good battery backup 30 hours of continuous playback and I have been listening to songs quite affect I guess two hours yesterday and two hours today so yeah battery backup on this headset is quite good anyway guys thank you for watching this stay tuned for more videos and I will see you guys next time

Hey guys, I am Siddharth, and in this big picture of excellence, there is one issue that keeps it from being the right choice for everyone, and we’re going to talk about that. Opening the box you get greeted by this welcome card which shines in multiple colors, then we get to some manuals, and then we get to this nice and hard carrying case which feels very high quality. It also comes with a pocket on back which can be handy. Inside we get this braided 3.5mm cable, because you can also use this in wired mode. Then we get a USB cable for charging, the detachable microphone, a USB A to USB C adapter, you get the receiver for the headphone which we will talk about later, and finally we get to the headphones. I have the electro punk version of these headphones, so it has these pink accents and translucent plastic. But the regular version comes in the usual black colour. The ROG Strix GO has won an IF design award, and it is easy to see why. This is one of the most well thought out designs that I have seen in a wireless headphone. Every part of this headphone’s design is just so good that you wouldn’t think this wasn’t made by a proper headphone brand. The headband cushion is really nice, the earcups swivel to 90 degrees so you can rest them on your chest while not using them, the earpads are very soft and they have a really amazing shape with these long earcups that are very comfortable while still being compact because the human ear is shaped like that. You really have to look closely to realize what a level of attention to detail is on this headphone, the clicky metal headband adjustment has ROG logo printed on it, and even the earcups have rubber pads in the places they make contact with the headband. The subtle ROG logos on the earcups also integrate well with the aesthetics without overdoing it. Next to the power switch on the headphone, you have a multifunction button which you can use to play pause and change tracks, and then you have the volume rocker, and you have to hold it up or down to increase or decrease volume and if you press it inside, it will mute the mic. A dedicated button to mute the mic would have been better, but this system also works fine. The comfort is good with the nicely shaped earpads that also have very nice memory foam, but it can get a little hot because of how airtight of a seal it forms around your ears. A character that I frequently observe in headphones with pleather pads and memory foam. The earpads on these also don’t seem removable, and I am not going to make a big deal out of this because most gaming headsets don’t have removable earpads, but every premium headphone should have removable earpads, whether it is meant for gaming or not. As the name suggests, the Strix Go 2.4 works with a 2.4 GHz wireless connection, and it comes with this USB Type C dongle that you will have to connect with whatever you want to use this with. The advantage of this is that unlike something with a Bluetooth connection, you won’t be facing any latency issues, which is critical for gaming, and because it has a USB type C port, you can use this with your PC, laptop, Nintendo switch, your phones, and even with iPhones and iPads if you are okay with living a dongle life. People have been asking me for a wireless headset to use for PUBG Mobile for a long time, so this will be really good. You can of course use it in a wired mode by plugging the cable in, and this headphone also comes in a wired version. The microphones on this are a very big highlight, and I say microphones, because there are actually 2 of them. So you do have a detachable boom mic, which is easily adjustable, but you may often forget to have it plugged in, or you might be using this with your phone without having it plugged, so for that Asus has included an in built microphone which is a really amazing idea, and this is how the inbuilt microphone on the headphone sounds like, and it sounds pretty good for an in-built microphone. But the boom mic on these headphones is very extraordinary because it includes Asus AI Noise cancellation, and when I first heard about it, I just thought it was a gimmick, because brands just keep adding AI to everything they release, but I was really blown away by how well it works when I tried it. So this is what the boom microphone sounds like and you can hear that it sounds pretty decent, but now I will play music on my phone at full volume and you can hear with the lav mic how loud the phone is. But now I have switched to the mic on the ROG Strix Go, and I think you must be able to hear how well it is rejecting the noise from such a loud source that’s close to it. The inbuilt mic doesn’t reject sound as well as this because it has to pick up your voice from a distance. So for regular kinds of noises that you have around, this should work extremely well, and suppose you’re in a gaming cafe where many people are shouting, this should be able to reject that noise well which is kind of a big deal. By the way, make sure that you're subscribed to the channel with bell icon so you don't miss out on future videos. The battery life on these is around 25 hours, and they also work if you keep them plugged in with a charger while using them, and they also support fast charging with 15 minutes of charge providing 3 hours, so you really should not face any issues with the battery life. Coming to sound quality, I think this is a very capable gaming headset. The soundstage and imaging on these is nicer than the lower priced gaming headsets that I have tried, and you do feel a very good sense of movement when things go from left to right, or when there is action going on on a distance in a game. But these have a very treble emphasized sound signature, and it’s almost like they just pushed the treble frequencies up by 4 or 5 decibels. So for music and general non gaming use, I really didn’t like these at all. If you listen to electronic music that is treble heavy on these, then your ears will probably start hurting. They do have high quality drivers, so even with the emphasized treble you don’t feel a sense of piercing sound on your eardrums, but the boost in treble is so high that you do feel the pressure of the higher frequencies on your eardrums, and it is not a comfortable feeling. You can tone it down by using similar equalizer settings like these, and you can see that I have to reduce the treble by 4 or 6 decibels, and then it manages to sound decent for music, but even then I wasn’t able to make it sound right. One quality I noticed is that even though the treble is boosted, the gunshots sound tolerable, but if you are playing something that has a lot going on in the high end, then you could find it to be fatiguing. If you are a bass head then these will definitely not be for you. Even for people who like balanced bass, I think these do lack them by a decibel or two. This is also an issue that I wasn’t able to correct with equalizer. So while I think that these should be good for gaming, especially for people who like a treble heavy sound signature because it helps them in hearing the footsteps more easily, I don’t think that they will be great for general media consumption. I also asked this question in audiophile groups that I am a member of, and most people did share similar thoughts as me on this subject of what kind of sound signature is better for gaming. But I also had very vocal responses from some people who said that they like treble emphasized headphones for gaming, and some said that they find high treble headphones to provide better clarity in footsteps and voices, so you will have to know what you want, and you could also let me know in the comments section about what kind of sound signature you like for gaming. In conclusion, I have slightly mixed feelings about this headphone. I totally love how well made it is, the attention to details that it has, I like how it looks, the microphone works extremely well and the second internal microphone is just a genius idea. Battery life is great, comfort is great, and it is just a headphone that has been executed very well. These cost around 200 US Dollars, and I think these do have enough technology and quality to justify the price. The sound is something that I do not agree on as a person who mostly reviews audiophile gear, I have gamer friends who also share similar thoughts about how gaming headphones should sound like, but there are people who do like this high treble sound signature, and for those people these are really going to be the best gaming headphones in this range. But if you like a balanced sound in a headphone, or if you want to enjoy the strong bass lines in music or in movies, then these are not going to be the ones for you, these are strictly meant to be used as gaming headsets only. Generally I don't care a lot about a product if it has a character that I don't like, but this particular headphone just does everything else so well, that I do feel a little sad that the sound signature is not more versatile. Non removable earpads at this price ping are also not a good thing. So I'll have links to buy this in the video description, give this video a thumbs up if you liked it or a thumbs down if you disliked it. Subscribe with bell, thanks for watching, and I’ll see you in the next one."

[Music] [Applause] hi this is Brian Campbell with old man new tech it's where we review budget electronics from a generation extras perspective why do we do it how we do it to save you money but we can't do this channel without you so if you could hit subscribe down below and smash that little bell and you'll get notified every time a new video comes out you'll also get your weekly dose of back in the day okay so here at old man new tech I'm always on the prowl for some decent active noise-cancelling headphones you'll notice on my channel and I'll put some links to some previous videos up above I've done some reviews I found some really good ones like the taotronics bh0 six zeros the TEL atronics bh 0 4 7s and the company Cohen saw these videos and they wanted to throw their their their hat in the ring and they sent me the Cowen se7 is now full disclosure they did send me these to review but as always I'll give you my honest opinion about them and see if they stack up to the Sony's and the Bose headphones of the world so I did a little research and I found these on Amazon and they come highly recommended by Amazon which means that they've gotten a lot of reviews and they've also gotten a lot of high ratings so you can find them for about $87 now Colin claims that there is super comfort and foldable low latency unsurpassed sound and up to 50 hours of play time so let's see if Colin delivers on the promises remember I did a review of cowan earbuds a few months back and I really liked him I highly recommended him so I had a good experience so my expectations are pretty high for these sexy little beasts right here so onto the unboxing first of all the the box itself is pretty plain flat black not gonna show any prints nice silver embossing there's your Cowan su-7 a and C wireless headphones and a little bit of info on the social deteriorate forward boxing let's see what they look like on the inside no nice so we have our our Cowan VIP card which we've already seen before that'll get you into all of the all of this secret parties at Cowan host I'm just kidding there but you will get additional extended warranties you'll be first in line for new products and exclusive discounts and they do have good customer support at Cowan so I do recommend going online and registering your product we've got our instruction manual there we go our user guide for the se7en c wireless headphones now these are pretty straightforward so not gonna worry about these right now alright the first thing I notice is the case it is a fine rich cutting theanine editor for your kids out there that was my best for card old Montalban by the way I love it when a case is included take note electronic companies that's the way to do it include a case with your headphones now inside the case okay so first thing I notice is the accessory case nice classy velvet accessory case we're gonna find out various connectors we've got a micro USB down there 3.5 millimeter double-ended aux cable so if you do run out pop run out of power you can plug this into your music source and you can wear it directly but that's not why I got these headphones I like bluetooth we've got an adapter for airplanes last but not least we've got a quarter-inch jack adapter for higher-end audio equipment so cool accessories nice little carrying bag there let's take a look at the headphones themselves so first impressions visually the cowan se7en C headphones have a clean minimalist look so they have nice black matte finish and you can get them in other colors I prefer the classy black there's a cute little embossment there that gives a little shine on the headphones but they're pretty low profile and not sure if you can eat it but they do have what's called protein padding for the ear cups now this protein padding is about as close as you can get to memory foam and they're very comfortable I got to tell you I've had these on a couple headphones now and they're really comfortable the headband is flexible and [Music] the ear cups rotate 180 degrees so they fit easily around your neck and fit really nice to your whatever shape skull you got there you know it's aluminum here for the interior of the headband that's adjustable so you can adjust the size depending on the size of your head you're going to notice that same protein padding here along the top of the headband that makes it comfortable to wear on top of your head and really the comfort level on these on a scale of one to ten I give them about a nine they are very comfortable it's kind of hard to read here but they are labeled right and left on the inside of the headband so you'll know which ear to put them on and notice the separate noise canceling switch right here so you turn that on if you like it shines green when it's on it's important to note because this switch operates independently of the power switch what that means is that it could be left on accidentally and if it is you could go too long it'll wear out the battery here we have the up-and-down volume control this is your power and your Bluetooth button it also answers phone calls here's your port for your 3.5 millimeter jack and it's still using a micro SB minor quibble with a lot of these companies I can't wait for a lot of you guys to migrate to us BC because I hate having to figure out which way to turn the charging cable when I'm plugging this in frustrating for you let me know down below [Music] now the battery life claims to be 50 hours and I'm sorry to say that I did not test it for a complete 50 hours I will tell you that I have worn them for an entire week not charge them one time use them once or twice a day never ran out of power and they do charge relatively quickly within I would say an hour an hour and a half you'll have a complete charge on these even though I never ran a ran them out they do last for quite a while so that's it for the looks let's see how they sound and listen to music you get really good mid-range but it's their very basic they're one of the bass ear headphones that I've reviewed so far I'm gonna give you a little bit of a listen to them here with my microphone so hopefully can hear that and I gotta tell you the bass on that is incredible the mid ranges are really smooth with no Distortion the upper end also when you crank them up you're not getting a lot of the source in there you could hurt your ears if you crank them up a little bit loud so once on the cowan se 7s are really comfortable and they're a little they grab a little bit tighter than the top tronic had set that I have upstairs but they really stay on good they're very comfortable and I got to tell you a worn them for hours with no discomfort and and quite cool they don't they don't get as hot as some other headphones that I've used before including the tail Tronics so and I think that's because the protein padding is a little bit more firm and it it holds itself a little bit farther away from the the head and the scalp so they they're very comfortable and like I said they stay on fairly firm and tighter to the head they don't project out as much as a lot of other headsets do and just on with the active noise canceling on you do get silenced I'm not hearing that that white hiss or the white noise and that's a matter of preference some people they do like white noise when they hear active noise-cancelling it helps them relax but this is performing on the level of what I've heard with Sony and Bose headsets final impressions so for final impressions you know I got to say that that these are really nice headphones and they look like they're going to last for a very long time so they're a high quality headset the noise is really good noise noise cancelling is really good and it does a great job of blocking out a lot of the low frequency noises that can drive you nuts whether it be on an airplane or in the house if you're doing laundry something like that they sound good - is that the music quality was great on them the latency was almost non-existent bluetooth 5.0 really steps up the range and the battery life on them is stellar so I would have to say that I highly highly recommend the kawan se sevens a and now back in the day so the year was 1976 the Bicentennial and the movie star wars had been released to the theatres Star Wars a new hope episode four yours truly old man Brian Campbell was a Star Wars fanatic I saw it 11 times at the very least 11 times at the movie theater and back in the day what we did to entertain ourselves in between the sequels was we've collected Star Wars cards they came with bubble gum sometimes you would get doubles but you have to collect your favorite hero they even came with stickers which I have not peeled off yet they came out in different colors as they were released in between the sequels here's my Ben Kenobi Luke Skywalker and c-3po but we will collect and trade these cards I'm not sure if they're worth anything now but to us they were priceless back in the day hey this is Brian with old man new tech we can't make this channel happen without you so please hit subscribe and smash that bell down below maybe looking for product links you'll find them there too thank you [Music]

headphones,2020-10-07 10:22:48.054810, I have the five best headphone deals of the season plus what not to buy great to be with you guys welcome back to the channel if you like this type of content please give it a thumbs up subscribe turn your notifications on I am here to unbox and save you money all of the deals that I'm gonna showcase are available on Matt's daily deals.com or reminder I do use affiliate links so if you are kind enough to use one of my links I will benefit monetarily but more importantly let's get to the unboxing so I'm going to go through the deals as the least expensive and then the most expensive on the spectrum there's a pair of headphones that you don't see for example there's brands I love like Sennheiser they're just not on sale right now at the time I'm recording this video so these are the best headphone deals on sales so let's start at the lowest and in terms of price although that by no means refers to low performance up got a pop up by the way feel free to join my email list the pair of headphones that I want to begin with is a good pair of over the ear headphones down to $39.99 from a hundred now with these headphones which are actually engineered in Las Vegas at the Consumer Electronics Show this is a pair of headphones where I get the breathability it's comfortable in fact let me let me show these to you up close the decibel bluetooth headphones especially the club studio headphones have an enhanced sound quality so your music will sound great you can quickly interrupt phone calls because this will allow for call answering with a built-in microphone you get the upgraded new bluetooth technology so at least 33 feet range and well most headphones on the market give you six to eight hours this promises a minimum of 10 and I've tested them at 11 and 11 and a half hours super breathable 39 bucks down from 100 best headphone deal number one now that's good for studying that's good for everyone being all home at the same time and if your classes aren't resuming anytime soon are you're doing that virtual learning this pair of headphones would be ideal for that I know someone that studies with classical music through these I would a hundred percent listen to death metal I also love Marilyn Manson thank you for listening let's move on to the second deal and I want to remind anyone watching right now the air pods are completely overpriced in fact for the price of the air pause in this little dental floss case that you get I would invest in this pair of JBL headphones now should mention the price that you see on your screen right now is reduced but you'll probably get a better deal if you wait a week or two oh no it's here here it is my bad 69 bucks sorry this price change it really depends on the color you pick I knew you could get a better price that's why I'm here the prices are changing every three seconds and a reminder on Matt's daily deals.com I do have the up-to-date pricing but 69 bucks damn from 99 the playback on here is virtually identical to what you would get out of the air plots I like the fact that the case is a little bit bigger I'm a klutz I'm less likely to lose this just that little bit of size I actually think makes a bit of a difference they feel weighted when I've had these in my ears and the battery performance is almost identical all of the manufacturers will over claim when it comes to battery life the air pods you get four or five if you're lucky sometimes only three or four after you've used them for a long period of time the JBL's claimed four hours of playback twelve hours out of the charging case I got about three and a half when I did this and for these which claimed 10 hours the reason I keep going back to these is because I actually got more than 10 hours on a couple of occasions so that was a nice thing deal number two deal number three I've never been a huge fan of beats by dre I always feel as though you're paying for a brand name or an aesthetic it's not worth full price ever in my opinion but these are sweat resistant and these are a huge price drop right now eighty nine ninety five down from two hundred year saving 110 bucks I like the splash of color and the headphones although you have to keep in mind that these are not truly wireless earphones we'll talk about that so these are sweat and water resistant they're good for the gym if you guys look at me you know I've really never worked out a day in my life and that's just fine trying to work on that but I'm not getting anywhere in these headphones because they have the hook they stay in differently when they're on your ears and I always prefer these generally if I am on the go to something that just fits inside your ear with that being said a pair of truly wireless earphones don't have a great battery life because they're both using their own independent Bluetooth connections to communicate with what could be a tablet a smartphone a desktop a laptop and well it's great that you can use one at a time which is a good way if you just have calls coming in or when I'm reporting on national television I'll put one of these in and just hear the anchors through one year which is which is great I don't need to use to the downside is you get less of a battery life on these power beats you're going to get twelve hours instead of your typical five for the price which is great because they are sharing some power capabilities through the wire that adjoins them on the back of your neck you don't mind that wire it's a great bang for your buck and that will bring me now to another deal headphone deal number three as we climb up on the headphone spectrum let's talk about the Bose sound sport true wireless earbuds so these are both truly wireless the battery performance out of here is good you're gonna get around five hours and this is good for people are on the go this is sweat and water-resistant a couple of features that I like for these wireless headphones they have that little ear mechanism where they balance a little bit better when they're inside your ear I'll show you a trick though for the Apple earpods you know in a moment if you really want that and you you desperately need Apple earpods but these are grateful running around from moving around sweat and water-resistant and they have some great features where you can actually track your earbuds with the case you get 10 hours out of this case it is a larger case may be a bit more cumbersome for a pocket but it fits well and you can also reverse track your headphones which is a beautiful thing if you've lost your earbuds as I do all the time you can actually track them on a map which is a great feature tied to the Bose products I love the sound on this I like the size of the case and if you love these headphones this would be my top pick number four is one of the top deals of the season although keep in mind if you do have 149 dollars to spend and you are a galaxy user a Samsung product affection Auto as I am for an on sale price the list price of 149 dollars at the time I am uploading for the Samsung Galaxy buds plus is a great grab now there's different colors for this I love the Samsung Galaxy buds these headphones have some incredible audio engineering and some good active noise cancellation so with these get 22 hours of battery life and my tests just shy of that 11 out of the headphones and then when you charge them in the case you get another 11 hours so be careful when you see 22 it refers to two different things it connects well with both Apple and Android devices the one-step connect obviously if you're an Android user is great and you're going to find that the ambience awesome so if you want to hear a little bit of the background noise in my house if I am streaming or I'm trying to record a podcast or I want to keep an ear on my daughter who is napping in her crib I control that with the ambience where and I can determine just how much of the surrounding noise comes into my headphones the fast charging time on here is great it is a three minute charge time to give you one hours of performance which is amazing beats has a similar feature which we'll discuss which is called fast fuel on one of their higher-end headphones but the sound engineering on here you got a tweeter and woofer on the headphones for AKG engineering at its best so just throwing that out there the Bose is one of the best deals of the season but if you had the same amount of money to spend the regular list price on the Samsung Galaxy buds might make that a better contender if the active noise cancellation is important for you it is better on this pair of headphones deal number five is a bit of a tie if I had to switch between two different headphones that fulfill two different types of purposes so the power beats pro at 199 down from 249 would actually make this one of the best beat deals of the season never in my life that I think I would have two beats products on a top five list as you can tell I'm not a huge fan of Beats but this is a very well engineered pair of headphones I will tell you that they're totally wireless they are high performance earphones you're gonna get a battery life of around eight and a half hours out of here although they do claim nine I've achieved that only twice in my tests they are great because you have the independent controls on each ear but and if you move around a lot be stay in for a little bit less money than the Apple earpods Pro you're going to find the battery life on this much better the charging case better and I actually prefer the design this is a good pair of headphones for someone that is athletic for someone that moves around and if you're watching now and you do a lot of multitasking as I do you got the laundry basket in one hand you're working from home you're trying to empty the dishwasher you've got a baby they've got all these things going on they are great because they do stay in but I do have a runner-up deal and another deal and a way to actually improve your Apple earpods which we'll talk about in a moment the Bose QuietComfort headphones at 289 down from three 49 are a great deal I didn't include this in my top five because they only offered this discount frequently on the rose gold though they have Alexa built in and so many other great features tied to this if you are not looking for rose gold headphones it would be difficult for me to actually include this on the list because the other colors are very infrequently reduced with that being said you get superb active noise cancellation and that on beyond a wear feature that I showed you on the Samsung Galaxy buds plus it's also present with the app that you can use on these headphones and I think they've got a graphic of the app there we go so that one out gives you the complete control that you would want over your headphones this may be complete overkill my thought on that is for a pair of headphones that gives you a similar feel to the Bose doesn't obviously have that level of active noise cancellation and it doesn't have an app but this is $39.99 and for $200 more on sale is it worth getting that active noise cancellation these days I don't find myself in the loud environments that I used to be in our crowds how we gather everything has kind of changed a little bit I'm not trying to drown out jet engines every three days as I commute between Toronto and New York so for me I think that active noise cancellation is an overkill but I'm just throwing that in there and now let's move on to the bonus deal and then that quick trick for your air pods the bonus deals are pair headphones I just finished testing it's not on sale which is why I'm not including it as a top deal of the season but it is a great design and a good list price and you'll find that although they have a 10% on a couple of items these do reduce from time to time I just think this is an ingenious design the superior sound on here is very similar to the JBL's that I showed you the difference is that JBL's are not waterproof they are not sweat proof and there's 69 bucks they're a brand name and they've got great audio but on these truly wireless headphones I found the audio may be a little bit less perhaps slightly less bass but you do get the ipx7 waterproofing level and how smart is this you have a charge indicator on your case so on the Apple air pots if I want to know how much time is left on my air pods I have to put them in my air I have to wait for it to come up on the phone a lot of the time it doesn't actually even give me the information that's accurate this is on the case which beautiful thing and then the case on here also acts as a power bank so it'll charge your smartphone that is an amazing $45 and $0.99 deal or maybe less depending on when you're watching it and these headphones do use bluetooth 5.1 which makes it a great grab and a wonderful well-balanced product now I can't actually give you a conclusive battery life number for this I've ordered a new pair I think I had a predecessor which doesn't have the exact same design so I can't make any claims in terms of battery life performance but you can read the reviews in the ratings people are very happy with these and now if you have the Apple earpods of the air pod Pro and you want to improve them or if you absolutely need to get these because they're so trending so hip just like I am let me show you this I will tell you the Apple earpods with the charging case are twenty nine dollars off the air pod pros are fourteen dollars and these discounts seem to continue to exist week after week so if they're not on sale on one particular week they will be on sale another and if you head over to mass daily deals.com get on my email newsletter I will update you on prices as they happen but the big takeaway is if your air pods are not staying in your ear nicely or if you have a pair of air pod knockoffs or alternates which I've actually covered in a different video get the ear hooks you can get three pairs of ear hooks for around eleven ninety five they're incredibly well rated and these will ensure you never need to adjust your ear pods ever again when I wear my air pods which I actually got as a present I'm constantly going like this to get them in perfectly and then I get complaints from people as I'm continuously adjusting them which is a pain and then on top of that if you guys have ever used air pods you know how sensitive they are you move it the wrong way and Apple thinks you're you're clicking the bottom and disconnecting your call and who wants that I've hung up on my Nana way too much these days and this is a product to ensure that doesn't happen 1195 a reminder guys I've made it very easy for you Matt's daily deals.com for the deals the blogs the coupons and some of the best headphone deals you will ever see if you liked what you saw again please give me a thumbs up it helps me know what to do for my next video so I'm saving you money not wasting your time and if there's any comments that you want to leave in

follow-up to one of the greatest wireless headphones of all time the sony wh-1000xm3s and if you don't already know which headphones i'm talking about i'm talking about the sony wh-1000xm4s and no if you're wondering this isn't them this is my old set of xm3s here are the xm4s and i happen to get them a day early so why don't we open up the sony wh-1000xm4s and find out if they're worthy improvement over the xm3s but before we get into these i want to give you all a huge thank you for tuning in to today's video whether you came from my main channel or you just found me on youtube somehow thank you so much for being here and make sure to hit that subscribe button if you haven't yet but i've got to say for me personally this is one of my most anticipated pieces of tech for 2020. this is a pair of headphones that i've been looking forward to for almost two years at this point ever since the xm3s came out so why don't i rip off this outer plastic and we'll take a quick look at the outside of the box i'm not kidding i've genuinely been really really excited for these headphones i just i can't wait to actually listen to them i can't wait to have all the extra features i'm stoked so majority of the outside of the box comes with this really nice matte textured finish which feels really nice to the touch of course the main image on the front of the box are the headphones themselves which let's be honest look just like the xm3s and then off to the side of the box we've got sony's logo the name of the headphones and then on the bottom some information about the battery life bluetooth capabilities and the fact that it has alexa and google voice google assistant is what i meant i called the google voice didn't i regardless it's got all the smart assistants if you choose to use them i don't usually use them on my headphones personally but that's up to you then on the back of the box you've got a ton of different information about the headphones themselves and also give you some links to download apps that can work with the headphones like the sony headphones connect app i obviously already have that app because i have the xm3s and other than an update i think i should be pretty much good to go i actually don't even know if i need to update the app i'll check before we actually try and sync up the headphones but i'm pretty sure it's already good the sony wh-1000xm4 is released tomorrow august 18th for a retail price of 349 bucks which to be honest is expensive but it's pretty much in line with all of the other headphones that are just as premium and have just as many features so why don't we finally pop this guy open and see it for the first time because i haven't seen this in person yet and i'm stoked so the first thing you'll see inside the box is the easy setup information download the app power on your headphones great let's put this top part down and then if you open up this flap you'll see the headphone case itself now i actually lost the headphone case for the xm3 so from what i remember this looks almost exactly the same as the xm3's headphone case but i could be wrong underneath the headphone case you've got some information about the headphones themselves you've got the warranty information and i believe the instruction manual as well or maybe that's just more warranty information no it's the reference guide we've got the reference guide in here but other than that that's everything that's inside the box look at that looking sexy af man i love these i'm not blown away though i mean they look just like the headphones that i'm wearing right now but hey if it ain't broke don't fix it actually my xm3s did break you may be able to see that little crack right there which i've heard is actually a pretty common problem and i've heard that sony did actually beef up the plastic around that area so that wouldn't happen on the xm4s that didn't sound good but back to the unboxing before we actually get to the headphones themselves let's pull out the cables that come with it which i believe are an aux cable right here and then also a airline adapter from what i remember it's the same accessories it came with the xm3s again i lost those accessories too so i don't remember for sure and then it looks like the last accessory you've got inside the bag is the usbc charger but they do not give you a wall wart you have to use your phone's charger or something like that it's also really short which is kind of a bummer i wish they gave you a longer one but it is what it is but here they are the sony xm4 is looking really nice with some extra padding around the top and some beefier plastic hinges other than that though the only real changes to the exterior of the headphones are changing the color of this logo right down here moving some of the buttons around adding a couple more mics and then also adding a proximity sensor inside the left earcup they really do look very very similar but what makes these headphones special is the fact that they've got a bunch of new internal changes that should make the experience of wearing these headphones a little bit better the first and most exciting change at least for me on the xm4s is the fact that you can now pair two different devices on the xm3s you could only have one device paired at a time and for me the time that i would be using these headphones the most is when i was working or traveling and the problem that i would have most often is that i would be editing a video on my laptop and then get a call on my phone or i'd be listening to music on my phone and then i'd really quickly need to make a change or do something on my laptop and i'd have to actually physically go into the bluetooth settings every time i wanted to switch between devices and change it manually but now it syncs up with two different devices so if i'm working on my computer and then i get a call on my phone i can automatically switch over without any issues to be honest that's a feature that bose has had for years and that's the reason why i even considered switching from my xm3s over to a pair of bows which i didn't end up doing but i was very very close to doing now to be honest the reason why i didn't switch from my xm3s to a pair of bose headphones was because the noise cancelling was so excellent and i've heard that it's gotten even better on the xm4s in addition to multiple device pairing you've got a feature called speak the chat which allows you to actually put the headphones on and then start talking and your music will hear it and automatically stop and not only that but it'll also allow for some mic pass through so you can hear what's going on around you so you can have short conversations with people without taking off your headphones these headphones aren't turned on though so i can't really hear anything because they already block out a huge amount of sound by just being on your ears that being said why don't we turn them on and pair them and see how they sound so now they're connected to my phone let me really quickly check the app and see if there's any new features that i just didn't know about there is actually an update great start setup and fully enjoy functions of the headphones 360 reality audio setup this is to optimize the 360 reality audio sound experience for you to enjoy an audio immersion experience as real as a live performance let's check it out try the sample music below to hear the difference let's do it that's all right okay let's hear 360 audio that's better that is cool though i can hear it behind me and now in front of me okay 360 audio is all right i'm mad at that they sound great it's still updating so they don't have the newest software setting but they sound good and the noise canceling on these sounds incredible i mean i can't say for sure if it sounds better than the xm3s yet because i haven't had a chance to actually test them out yet but i will come out with a full review of these headphones in the next couple days and let you know really what my experience has been oh this is cool this was the setting that i was talking about where you could talk and it would pause music and you could hear yourself that's awesome another feature is that if you take off the headphones they'll stop playing music that's actually one of the reasons for this proximity sensor in the left ear cup comfort wise though they do feel really really nice obviously it's a similar design so it's going to feel similar to the xm3s but they really did add more padding in the top which i appreciated and it felt like it was a little bit softer around my ears i could just be imagining that or they could have added more padding around the ears i'm not 100 sure some other awesome features of the xm4s which aren't really new from the xm3s but are still there on the xm4s and are still just as great are the 30 hour battery life and the 10 minute 5 hour charging which i've got to say is a lifesaver when it comes to traveling i never had any battery life issues with the xm3s and i would expect that the xm4s are going to be just as good one new feature that i'm actually really excited about on the xm4s is that apparently if you hold your right hand up to the right ear cup it pauses the music so you can have conversations with people and in addition to pausing the music it also allows for that mic pass through so you can better hear what's going on around you i know that almost seems redundant because you already have the speak to chat feature but what it does allow you to do is listen to announcements at places like the airport oh two other things that i forgot to mention were one you still have the touch controls on the side of the headphones whether you like them or whether you don't like them they're still there and not only that but sony also added some more external mics on the headphones so call quality should sound a little bit better that's something that i haven't tested personally but that's something that i definitely will test when i give these headphones a full review overall though in the couple of minutes that i've had these headphones and tested them out i've been really impressed now are they a worthy upgrade over the xm3s i would say so if you're willing to upgrade headphones and willing to spend another 350 on a new set of headphones they're not like groundbreakingly different but they do improve on some pain points that i had with the xm3 so for me personally as someone who wanted to upgrade to a newer pair of headphones this was perfect if you already have a pair of xm3s and you don't feel like spending the money though or you want to buy a pair of xm3s now that they're on discount that might actually be the way to go instead of grabbing a new pair of xm4s but with that we wrap up the unboxing of the sony wh-1000xm4s now i would love to know your thoughts on these headphones and whether you're considering picking up a pair for yourself so let me know in the comment section down below also if you're looking to grab a pair of these headphones for yourself don't forget to stay tuned for the review which is coming out in the next couple days because once i've actually had a chance to try out these headphones for myself i'll be really excited to tell you all the things that i love and don't love about these new headphones but as always thank you so much for watching make sure to subscribe if you haven't yet and i'll see you all in the next one you

I received a pair of Jabra Elite 85h headphones in black to test and review at home and in the office, and this is what I found.

Jabra Elite 85h are fully wireless, over-ear headphones that use Bluetooth to connect to your smartphone, tablet or device. 



As soon as you put them on you’ll notice they have killer noise isolation properties. 

There’s a difference between Noise Cancelling & Noise Isolation when it comes to wireless Bluetooth headphones. 

Noise isolation is the act of physically isolating your ears from outside sound; think fat padding on over-ear headphones, or a great seal on in-ear wireless headphones.

Noise cancellation technology on the other hand uses digital algorithms to listen for outside nose, then block it out by creating a digital mask over that sound bleed. While both can be effective, noise cancelling technology tends to be more expensive, so your budget may determine what you choose. These headphones also have Noise Cancelling, technology Jabra calls smart Active Noise Cancellation. Before we get to that we’ll want to talk about the Jabra app, which you’ll need to get the most from these headphones.

Jabra Sound+ App

Jabra has an app that allows you to get finer control over your headphones. Using the app you can adjust many of the features of the headphones including noise cancellation, sound levels including equalization and you can even hunt down your headphones if they’re lost.


Turning the headphones on and off
This is weird, and for a lot of folks might make it way too easy to leave these on accidentally. The Jabra Elite 85h automatically turns on when you rotate the earcups into the wearing position.



The headphones automatically turn off when you fold the earcups flat.




 Connecting more than one device

You can connect more than one device at a time to these headphones which is a great feature. To do it, just put them into pairing mode, and go to your second device and look for them in your Bluetooth menu.



How well does Noise Cancellation work?

Noise cancellation technology uses digital algorithms to listen for outside nose, then block it out by creating a digital mask over that sound bleed. 

Using the Jabra Elite 85h Noice Cancelling feature creates a great ‘cone of silence’ around you. It really does keep everything happening outside you from bleeding in. Chatty co-workers, barking dogs, or the neighbour's lawn mower were all successfully blocked out.

To turn noise cancelling on or off, you can use the Sound+ app, or bush the small oval button on the left earcup; this lets it cycle through the various modes without using the app.

What is Jabra HearThrough?

HearThrough is a cool feature that lets you allow outside noise into the headphones. This is designed to make you more aware of your surroundings when walking in busy areas, commuting or just needing to keep ears on what’s happening around you.

Turning on this feature in the Sound+ App lets you hear nearly everything around you, while blending that sound appropriately with your music or audio so you get both at once.

This feature woks quite well, and provides a good balance of outside ambient noise and music and helps you feel safer and less isolated. Plus, using the app, you can adjust how much ambient noise to let in; from lots to almost none.


Battery Life

These headphones are built to last and last when it comes to battery life. Jabra says the Elite 85h will give you 36 hours of battery life even with the ANC switched on. Sound quality & call quality

After going through all those features, it’s easy to almost forget about the primary feature: sound quality. I’m happy to report these sound great! 

The headphones sound very clear, and it's easy to pick up on small details in the music like drumsticks on the rim, claps or breaths. Without fussing with the equalizer, you get a very even sound that doesn't lean too hard in any high or low direction. With the ability to customize and fine tune your audio you can truly get a perfect sound.

When it comes to podcasts, voices are clear and the overall sound is well balanced.

Watching videos was great too; when I was watching YouTube, there was no lag between the audio and video as I have found on some headphones.


Overall review of Jabra Elite 85h wireless headphones

Overall, these are great headphones. They're comfortable, they sound great, and they're versatile thanks to the wired jack option. If there were any cons, it's probably that I found the preset audio settings weren't very deep or robust.But I don;t have any hesitation recommending the Jabra Elite 85h if you're looking for a new set of premium headphones.

These headphones sell for $399CAD from places like Best Buy and Amazon.",28,8048,24.0,272.0,9.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-HNLoPnr0To/hqdefault.jpg,Jabra|elite|85h|review|how

upgrade and all of a sudden you're in the market again case in point lead Jabra elite 85h wireless headphones I'm Erin for tech gadgets Canada comm and I have tried a lot of Jabra products going all the way back to my first bone conduction wireless bluetooth headset for the car I've got to say I've always been impressed with Jabra products I received a pair of the Jabra elite 85h headphones recently in the black color here to test and review in my home and at the office and I'll tell you what I found an early heads up though that if you end up liking this video and finding it helpful too please hit that like button and give me a sub because it does help me keep making more videos that I hope everyone out there can watch enjoy and learn from Jabra elite 85h are fully wireless over ear headphones that use bluetooth to connect to your smartphone tablet or device there's a multi-function button that lets you play or pause without needing your phone and you can use the headphones to summon your digital assistant - to get these phones set up just turn them on as soon as you put them on your ears you'll hear a voice prompt telling you to go to your phone's bluetooth menu and choose the Jabra elite 85h from your menu I was connected in seconds with just a single click you can connect these headphones to more than one device at a time and to a phone tablet or a computer what's in the box what comes in the box is rather impressive you get a large leather look carrying case that comes complete with a handful of Handy accessories like an aux cord if you want to use these in Wired mode a charging cable and a dual aux airplane jack for use on some older airplane models the first thing I noticed about these headphones is that the ear cups are huge now not so much from the outside but it feels like there is a ton of real estate on the inside for your ears at the same time there is plenty of cushiony thick padding yes these headphones are ultra padded and as soon as you put them on you're going to notice they have killer noise isolation properties now there's a difference between noise cancelling and noise isolation when it comes to wireless bluetooth headphones noise isolation is the act of physically isolating your ears from outside sound think phat padding on over ear headphones or a great seal on in the ear Wireless head phones noise cancellation on the other hand uses digital algorithms to listen for outside noise than to block it out by creating a digital mask over that sound bleed well both of these technologies can be effective noise canceling technology tends to be the more expensive so your budget may determine what you choose now these headphones also have noise canceling technology Jabra calls it smart active noise cancellation before we get to that we will want to talk about the Jabra app which you'll need to get the most from these headphones Jabra has an app that allows you to get finer control over your headphones using the app you can adjust many the features of your headphones including the noise cancellation sound levels including equalization and you can even hunt down your headphones if they're lost I will say I found the app finicky nine times out of ten I'd try to get the app to connect to the headphones to use some of the features but the app wasn't seeing the headphones and it was telling me to reconnect even though I had music already playing it was really only able to get the app to connect randomly and infrequently which was frustrating when it comes to music presets there are six music preset settings available on your Jabra elite 85h there's default bass boost smooth speech treble boost and energized the difference between these settings is minimal to my ear well the bass boost is easiest to pick out the rest seemed quite similar I gave the headphones to a co-worker and asked her if she noticed any differences while I was switching up the modes and she really only noticed treble boost saying it sounded like the bass got nixed there's also an equalization setting in this app using the sound plus app you can adjust audio settings to fine tune your bass mid-range and treble by dragging your finger along the line the adjustments are far more noticeable than using the presets you can really fine-tune your sound and get lots more bass treble or just configure the sound however you like it these headphones have a feature that until now I've only seen in Apple headphones it's called find my Jabra when enabled using the Jabra sound plus app you can see exactly where on a map your headphones last turned on and connected to bluetooth this feature works great and can help you find your headphones if you've forgotten them stay at the office or somewhere else another feature I really liked is the on ear detection on your detection can tell when you've placed the headphones on your ears and when you take them off I found this setting worked great and helped preserve my battery life it also made it easy to listen to podcasts at the office where interruptions happen frequently now let's talk about the noise cancellation and the ambient functions using the Jabra elite 85h noise canceling feature creates a great cone of silence around you it really does keep everything happening outside you from bleeding in from chatty co-workers to barking dogs or the neighbors lawn mower all of those things were successfully blocked out during my testing on the other hand here through is a cool feature that lets you allow outside noise into the headphones now why well this is designed to make you more aware of your surroundings when you're maybe walking in busy areas commuting or you just need to keep your ears on what's happening around you turning this feature on in the sound Plus app lets you hear nearly everything happening around you while blending that sound appropriately with your music or your audio so you get both at once this feature works really well and provides a good balance of outside ambient noise and music and helps you feel safer and less isolated plus using the app you can adjust how much ambient noise to let in from lots to almost none these headphones are made to last and last when it comes to battery life Jabra says the elite 85 H will give you 36 hours of battery life even with the active noise cancellation switched on I can say accidentally left the headphones on and connected to my phone with music playing all day and I still got many more days of battery life from them after I finally shut them down plus with fast charging you can get five hours of battery life from just 15 minutes of charging after going through all those features it's easy to almost forget about the primary feature and that's the sound quality I'm happy to report that these headphones sound great the Jabra elite 85 H sound really clear and it's easy to pick up on small details in the music like drumsticks on the rim claps or breaths without fussing with the equalizer you get a very even sound that doesn't lean too hard in any direction whether that's high or low and with the ability to customize and fine-tune your audio you can truly get

#RazerOpus #NoiseCancelling #THXCertified",28,7684,52.0,386.0,8.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/309BXbshpW0/hqdefault.jpg,razer|opus|wireless|active|noise|cancelling|headphones|true|apple|android|anc|sony|bose|wh1000xm3|qc35 ii|mic|test|review|gamesky|gaming|wired|battery|premium,2020-10-07 10:22:48.055102, alright guys so today we're gonna check out the brand new Razer Opus headphones now this is not the normal gaming style headphone from Razer in fact this is a THX certified Wireless active noise-cancelling pair of headphones so this is more geared towards being the one pair of headphones that you can use for everything and with them being THX certified these would be really good for watching movies and different types of media so if you're looking for a pair of headphones and you don't want to spend the price tag of the sony WH 1000 XM 3s or the bose qc25 s we're gonna see if the Razer Opus is worth the $200 price tag but let's start with the fact that they are available in black and midnight blue so unlike other Razer products they're not available in bright neon colors it doesn't have the usual neon green and I have the midnight blue model here which really just kind of looks like a lighter black it's hard to even tell that it's blue so you can tell they're trying to be real subtle about the colors and they're also trying to be real subtle about the design there's not a whole lot of big branding going on it's very simple and I really like the look of these now as far as some of the technology that's in here they do have an app that works with the headphones and really the only benefit that I see to having the app is it has different preset EQ settings that are built-in but I found that the thx setting that's on these right out of the box was the one that I preferred anyway so outside of that I really don't see a benefit to having the app now these are Bluetooth 5.0 they do have app techs and AAC playback and as far as the battery life you're going to get around 25 hours of use on a single charge so it's not up there with some of the 40 hours that I've seen on other headphones but 25 hours is gonna get most people through a week before needing to charge these so I think the battery life is more than okay and I don't think many people would complain now moving over to looking at what you get in the Box the first thing I want to point out is I think the box itself even has a really nice premium look to it and the first thing you're gonna see inside the box is the carrying case which is a very nice hard carrying case it's kind of flat like the bows and the so knees which basically means that the headphones just kind of fold down and fit in the case that way but it is a nice looking case and it won't take up a lot of space in your bag they are very lightweight I did notice because of the plastic build if you do twist these a little bit you will notice some slight creaking it doesn't worry me that these are gonna break but it is kind of annoying that it makes these sounds now as far as the padding I feel like the headband has more than enough padding because of the headphones being so light it's one of those that you can really kind of forget that you even have them on they don't really have a tight clamp force on them but they do say on the head very well and I found that the padding on the ear pads was also really nice because it has the memory foam cushions in it and it really just kind of formed around my ears and felt very soft now one thing that definitely threw me off is I kind of expected these to have touch controls considering that seems to be on a lot of the more modern headphones but razer decided to go back to actual physical button controls which I personally prefer just because the swipe controls always kind of seem inconsistent and sometimes you can just accidentally do something that you don't really mean to do but as far as on the headphones on the left side you have your power button you also have a noise canceling / ambient mode button and ambient mode on these work very well so if you just kind of press and hold it the microphones will bring in your surroundings and you just kind of carry on a conversation or hear what's going on around you without actually taking off the headphones now I really would have liked to have seen the headphones have different levels of noise canceling but you really just have noise canceling on or off and the noise canceling on these I think do a very good job now it's definitely not up to the Sony or Bose standards as far as noise cancelling goes I would say that it's about 80% of what those are capable of but I think for the price tag you're still getting really nice noise cancelling considering these don't cost as much as the Sony or Bose now also on the left side you have an input for your three-and-a-half millimeter cable which means that you can use these as a normal wired pair of headphones if you want to use them that way and then there's also a USB C input which is how you would charge these so inside the box you are getting the three half millimeter cable and the USBC cable and they've also included a USB adapter so that you can charge these like if you're gonna plug them into your PC or into a wall outlet now other than that they have included an airline adapter and then the only other controls are on the right hand side that is where your controls for your play your pause skipping your tracks forward going backwards and even your volume up and volume down so it is really simple when it comes to the controls it's not very complex and it's definitely easy to get a hold of another huge bonus with these and one feature that I like is these also have these smart sensors so that when you take the headphones off they will automatically pause and then when you put them back on they will automatically resume now this is a feature that you see in most noise cancelling headphones and I think that is done very well here now as far as the microphones on the Opus I think they did a pretty decent job overall but you guys can be a judge by listening to a test here so here is a mic test using the Razer Opus I think it does a fairly decent job of picking up my voice but this is what it would sound like if you were to take a call so now let's talk about the sound the sound is the one thing that completely surprised me about these because most of my history with Razer products usually consist of overpowering bass there are usually boomy headphones and you're lucky to get a lot of clarity out of them but you definitely get a lot of impact and what these do is focus a lot on the clarity so vocals come through very nicely the detail and instruments are nice and clean and you can hear dialogue if you're gonna watch movies or hear subtle things that a lot of other headphones miss these do an excellent job of picking up details the bass is nice and clean it's really accurate it's just not what I expected out of a razer product and comparing these two these Sony's the Sony's have a lot more bass but I feel the Razer has a lot more clarity so it's kind of hard to compare these to the Sony's because in my opinion this is a completely different style of sound coming out of these headphones now the more you turn the volume up the more impactful the bass does get but you can tell that they're leaning towards being accurate felt like the dialogue and movies came through extremely well it was really easy to tell where things are coming from so the soundstage and the sound imaging on these are just excellent I really enjoyed listening to these and I honestly think that I kind of leaned more towards using these because of the clarity that they had and now if you're somebody that likes overpowering bass or you like that subwoofer style bass to me these just don't deliver on that front but if you like a lot more clarity if you like a pair of headphones that lean a little more towards accuracy and has noise cancelling this is actually an excellent pair of headphones now as far as some of my cons with these I really would have liked to have seen the build quality be a little bit better now I'm not worried that these are gonna break but I'm not a huge fan of when my headphones start to creak if I kind of twist them a little bit and the only other thing outside of that is I really would have liked to have seen the app have a little bit more options when it comes to noise cancelling and same thing with the headphones you just have noise cancelling on or off when you have pairs like the Sony that has different levels of noise cancelling and even like the Bose 700 that has I believe 10 or maybe 15 different levels of noise cancelling with the razor you just get it on or off and I feel like you're kind of limited so I think the $200 price tag is more than warranted here especially getting the THX certified which to me sounds excellent with games and with movies and I really enjoyed the sound signature with the music that I listened to which is everything I think these fit all different types of situations and the $200 price tag you're getting a lot for the money but guys that's my video on the brand new Razer Opus headphones thank you so much for checking out this video thank you so much for checking out all the other videos and as always make sure to stay

m50x|ath-m50xbt|bluetooth,2020-10-07 10:22:48.055145, in this video I'm gonna be reviewing these headphones these are the audio technica ath m50x bTW this is the bluetooth version of the studio monitor headphones and in this video I'm gonna be doing a long-term review of these awesome headphones with some pros and some cons so let's get into it before I begin this video of course smash the like button and subscribe you know what to do down below and also if you like the shirt check out my shop at aqua dot shop you can find all my merch there so let's talk about these headphones so I bought the audio technica ath m50x BTW first of all that is way too long of a headphones title like they just need to call it like headphones Pro anyway the name of these headphones is really long but the quality of these is really great they run about two hundred dollars right now they're actually 180 on Amazon I'll leave a link to that in the description below but yeah I've been using these headphones for studio monitoring for making music and just for general listening and watching movies and that kind of thing so the most important thing to me in a pair of headphones is by far the audio quality so let's talk about that first in terms of audio quality I would give these headphones maybe an 8.5 out of 10 they're really really good they definitely have a little bit of bass response and they go pretty deep into the sub bass but they're definitely not super rumbly when it comes to really deep frequencies the highs are nice and sparkly and they have a very nice kind of stereo width when you listen to them you can hear all kinds of details flying in and out from left to right it's just very pleasing to listen to these especially for a long period of time sometimes the high trebles can be a little sharp in these like sometimes the S noses and the high hats cymbals that kind of stuff can be a little too edgy like a little too crispy for my personal taste but if you like a really sparkly treble kind of sound in your headphones you're really gonna like these the cons of the sound quality on these I would say is in the mids to the mid lows there's not a super thick sound to these the bass is definitely there it's just not very punchy so in general I do like the sound of these I just wish there was a little more you know mids and mid low sin and a little bit more bass but then again I'm usually not using these for really crazy listening where I want the most Bumi and you know theatric kind of sound I'm mostly amusing these when I'm making music when I'm using them as a studio monitor I really like the aesthetic of these I do think they look kind of huge when they're on my head they kind of jet out wide but they do have a lot of give to them you know they don't feel like they're going to break they're made of this kind of matte plastic type of feel with a little bit of this metal on the inside and I do like the band like there's this nice kind of cushion that I do enjoy and overall they're pretty comfortable to wear they fit right on my head pretty nicely and I do wear these obviously with glasses underneath and one thing I can say that's a little bit of a negative but this isn't so much these headphones it's just kind of over the ear headphones in general is they do press down on my glasses a little bit and into my head so I can actually create like a headache kind of feel for me and my head gets a little hot under these there's not a whole lot of airflow going in and out because these are closed back headphones and you know I live in Texas y'all it is hot here so I do have to take these off after about an hour or thirty minutes or something like that just to cool my ears off a little bit because they do get a little moist a little sweaty but I do like that the sound signature on these it's so even and it's so flat it just sounds very pleasant to listen to like I said so it doesn't really feel like these are very fatiguing on my ears I can listen to these for hours at a time while I do get hot they're not very fatiguing when it comes to the sound which is a really good thing one thing I do wish these actually came with especially at the price point of about $200 is I wish audio-technica threw in a hardshell case for these but I do appreciate that you can fold them up like this and they're pretty compact if you're traveling a lot they're really awesome for that I've used these for DJing several times too these definitely don't sound like noise cancelling headphones because you're not always cancelling headphones but they do isolate your environment noises a little bit when you put them on so you can kind of focus in on your music project and that leads me to the next subject which is the wireless capability of these these use bluetooth 5.0 which means they're lower power than other previous models or versions of Bluetooth and the battery on these things is awesome Audio Technica says these headphones will last about 40 hours on one charge these lasts like forever I barely even have to charge these maybe once a month and I'm talking about using it for at least an hour a day but there is a downfall of the charging mechanism and that is these headphones use micro USB that alone to me kind of dates these a little bit not the end of the world it's just kind of annoying and it makes these seem kind of less premium for some reason so when it comes to Bluetooth connectivity the Bluetooth 5.0 works really well with this I don't experience much latency or lag when it comes to playing music or videos even watching YouTube I don't hear any kind of sync issues with these so that's really good but the big kind of downfall of the Bluetooth on these is they only pair with one device at a time and they can't easily be transferred from device to device you have to manually go into your Bluetooth settings every time you want to change the device you're using these with and disconnect these from that device and then connect them manually to the next device which is not a huge deal like it's not the end of the world but sometimes I'll forget which device I'm using these on and I'll turn them on and I'll hear the little beep that says it's paired with the device but I won't remember which device it's on you know is it on my iPad is it on my laptop my phone so I have to go into each device and feel like that I use it on this device that I use it on that like there's no manual bluetooth pairing button on here where I can just unpair this with one device remotely and then just pair it with another device that I'm already holding so I do wish there was some kind of pairing button on these that would make it a lot easier to be able to switch this from device to device there are some multifunction buttons on these headphones though like a volume up and volume down and then there's a multifunction button in the middle they're very easy to use the ease of use is amazing on these you just kind of turn them on they're paired they're ready to go pairing is usually pretty fast with bluetooth 5.0 so that's not really an issue and while you can use these with a wire obviously because there is a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack on there but I prefer to use them most of the time with bluetooth I like having that wireless capability where I can just walk away with these headphones on listen to I mix and then come back make a change and then walk away and paste that's kind of my weird process but it works really well for that so I do end up using these on Bluetooth about ninety-five percent of the time and I don't notice a huge difference when it comes to audio quality between using Bluetooth versus using a cable situation which is a really good thing because sometimes you'll turn on bluetooth on wireless headphones and then all of a sudden the audio quality will change or you won't hear as much bass or treble and it sounds like a more compressed sound but seriously I cannot tell almost any difference between the wired version of these or the Bluetooth version which is a huge positive and in conclusion I do think that are an awesome deal even at $200 I actually found an open box version of these I think for about 129 and at that price these are an absolute steal I think in terms of audio quality build quality the accuracy of frequencies the overall design is pretty nice the Bluetooth functionality is super awesome I love being able to use these wirelessly it makes a huge difference in my process however switching devices on these is a pain in the rump shaker I wish these pick connect to a couple devices at the same time so I can kind of seamlessly switch back and forth that's not the end of the world though and I still think these are an awesome value so let me know what you think in the comments of these headphones having used them do you have other recommendations for other Bluetooth headphones that you think are better than the 80 H and 50 X bTW it's so long anyway I love these headphones I hope you enjoyed this video if it was helpful smash the like button and the subscribe button the notification though also if you want to hear my music search for Ben aqua on Spotify and Apple music thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video

headphones|wireless headphones for working out,2020-10-07 10:22:48.055189, so if you're not familiar with em pow they're a manufacturer of audio products and they make everything from wireless earbuds to Bluetooth speakers and pretty much everything in between today we have their h19 IPO Bluetooth wireless anc headphones at about 40 to 45 US dollars they look super affordable but we need to see if they're actually worth it the headphones come in a small cardboard box with a micro USB charging cable 3.5 millimeter cable that can be used if you run out of battery power a small user manual and a soft carrying bag I want to start this review by talking about comfort because wireless headphones like these tend to be something that people wear often and for long periods of time while they're traveling commuting exercising and all sorts of stuff like that so if they're not comfortable then you know what's the point so right away we can see this nice thick foam padding on the ear cups it's really quite soft and comfortable and there's some more of it up top on the headband which is also nice so it is soft and comfortable up against your skin but at the same time the ear cups are actually on the small side and what that means is depending on your ear size they might sit on top of your ear as opposed to around them and for some people that might make for an uncomfortable situation so just be aware of that but that's a compromise or a trade-off for such a small and compact footprint which helps with portability so it's not all bad and I think if you're looking for something that's gonna be subtle that you can wear every day and kind of blend in nothing crazy that's gonna stand out and have people stare at you and think you're communicating with the International Space Station or something like that then this is a good option these deliver that portability and nice small footprint and subtle look the ear cups have both tilt and swivel movement which should help fit a variety of different ear and head shapes and the headbands adjustable as well so it should fit most people even when wearing a hat you can also fold the ear cups inward to reduce the size even further to make for super easy storage and carrying the entire package is pretty lightweight at just 240 grams which I guess isn't surprising considering they're made mostly from plastic but they do feel pretty solid in the hand and that gives me the impression that they should be able to withstand a little bit of abuse without falling apart all of the controls are located on the bottom of the ear cups and they're actually pretty easy to find even when you're wearing the headphones on the left side there's a 3.5 millimeter jack and the ANC switch and on the right there's some volume buttons d function power button and micro USB charging port and a built-in microphone pairing the headphones with your Bluetooth devices as easy as powering them on and then selecting mpow h19 IPO in your Bluetooth settings the large 40 millimeter drivers deliver pretty good sound quality for a pair of wireless headphones in this price range I mean it's nowhere near the quality that you can get from some of those big expensive premium options out there but that's alright because these are just 40 bucks and I think a lot of people are going to be completely satisfied with the sound quality that these are able to deliver one of the main features on these is anc or active noise cancellation and what that does is it tries to remove some of the background noise like traffic or the sounded jet engines when you're on a plane and stuff like that and it actually works pretty well but I happen to notice that when ANC is turned on the audio playback actually sounds better so I chose to leave it on pretty much all of the time while I was testing these now there are a couple of issues with this though the first is that when ANC is turned on battery life is reduced quite a bit and the second thing is I noticed this weird hissing sound when you have ANC turned on and there's no audio playback coming through the headphones now that part might not be a huge deal because if you're wearing the headphones you're probably listening to something and not just having dead air in the background so you might not notice that as much battery life serrated at 35 hours but that's with ansi turned off and when you turn and see on like I said before that's gonna take quite a bit of a hit how much of a hit is hard to say I tested these probably for about 10 hours with an C turned on and they were still going strong so it's not gonna be too bad but one of the other things you can do if you do run out of power is they do support a little bit of a quick charge function where 10 minutes of charging is supposed to give you 2.5 hours of playback so there's that and there's also that 3.5 millimeter audio cable where if you don't mind plugging them into your device you can just use them even if the battery is completely dead now the built-in mic on these was just designed to function for basic phone calls and really nothing more so don't expect amazing quality that's for sure I did test it and it basically sounded like when you're talking to somebody through speakerphone the quality was pretty low so I mean I guess that's fine for phone calls but that's about it if you want to use these for gaming or any kind of audio recording on your computer or laptop I would definitely recommend getting a separate microphone so that you can get better quality so the bottom line is that the mpow h19 IPO wireless anc headphones deliver pretty good sound quality and they have active noise cancellation that actually happens to do a pretty good job and they're packaged in this nice clean sleek small and lightweight design it's nice and it's portable and they sell for about forty to forty five US dollars on amazon at the time of this recording which i think is a really good price for a set of wireless headphones with all of these features so if you're interested make sure you check out the purchasing links down in the description of this video thanks for watching don't forget to

is Tony from audio holics today we're going to be looking at the tma-2 HD wireless over the ear headphones from ai ai ai at first glance they don't look like a 350 set of headphones but let's look what goes into these and see what they're made of the team hu is considered a modular headphone meaning that you can change the setup depending on your needs that's the good news now the bad news is you do have to snap them together yourself it's kind of like following in IKEA directions except it's way simpler ai ai ai sent me the Alec answer ear pad model but for five dollars less you can have the leather pads Alec contra has a soft microfiber material and I was surprised at how comfortable the ear pads felt even after extended listening sessions there were times where I could feel the plastic driver against my ear you might not find that more supportive ear pads but overall I was really impressed with the comfort of the pads on the tma-2 the diaphragm is made of 40 millimeter bio cellulose material which is often found in much more expensive headphones ai ai ai says the bio cellulose diaphragm provides a stiffer lighter and stronger material than regular PE T speaker units and allows sound-producing diaphragm to vibrate without the levels of distortion found in other speakers the headphones come with a PTX codec so the sound is about as close to CD quality as you can get through a Bluetooth to Vitus to power the tma-2 press and hold the middle buttons for about 2 seconds to power off press and hold the top button for a few seconds to pair the tma-2 with a device simply press and hold the top and bottom buttons for a few seconds once I got the hang of it connection to my devices was pretty easy the tma-2 connected seamlessly to my iPhone every time I used it but with older Bluetooth devices I had a bit more trouble that was until I learned to delete all the previous devices from the headset before trying to connect them to new device to delete all previous devices press and hold all three buttons for a few seconds now let's go out on the street and see what other people think of them ok so you've tried out the ai-ai-ai-ai headphones what do you think of them they're definitely very comfortable that's the initial read that I get from them sound quality is pretty good I wish it came with a little bit more bass but that's just my personal reference preference but besides that I think they're a great pair of headphones ok do you have a name-brand pair I do have a name-brand pair do you pay about the same price as easy to go for three hundred and fifty dollars maybe not I don't think as expensive buy I could definitely tell that there's a definitely a quality of better quality in these headphones alright so what did you think of them they sounded really good I couldn't really hear anything else besides the music what it was playing which is really nice they're really comfortable it's really cushy it fits really well it like conforms to a head shape really nicely overall give it a good 10 out of 10 how was the sound come here dears definitely Maura I felt like it was like almost like a surround sound versus just listening to music I will thank you all right so you tried out the TMA chews and now what do you think well first they're very comfortable to wear that's the first thing I know I have some at home that are of a different name brand and they are over time very uncomfortable but I feel like for a long period of time the padding is just right and it doesn't really feel like expressing my head there's enough settings there to make it adjustable enough to fit just about anybody but they're really light which I thought translated into maybe not very expensive or not very conventional material I don't know but they they're very light they're almost transparent the only thing I would say is that when I put them a little bit towards the back they do slip but once on they feel really really solid and and what you think of the sound compared to the ones that you have they are really really precise in the mid-range and in the highs I thought they really did a great job producing especially some older rock classics and even even newer rock classics I thought the drums and the guitar and the voices and even the high part of the cymbals sounded great the bass was not as present as they are with the said I have at home but I sometimes think the said I have at home kind of his disproportionate tries to blow up the bass you know maybe more than it should the sound was precise though and I said I thought all of it was represented very well even at the low end but I thought I could have a little more punch in the low end considering they got so much apparatus around your head I kind of expect usually when I put on a full set of headphones I'm going to get a little bit more of the lower end presence so you can see the consensuses that the tma-2 sound great are really comfortable pair easily two cell phones and our overall really good pair of headphones the headphones have a listed runtime of 16 hours from a single charge but for me the battery held out longer than I had time to listen to them in one session the tma-2 come with a two-year warranty and the pair we looked at today will set you back three hundred and fifty dollars but with a 30-day return policy plus ten dollars shipping it's worth the risk of trying them out over famous name-brand headphones for the same price but with lesser abilities so once again this is Tony Liotta from audio ha Alex keep listening

Noise Cancelling Headphones|Sony WH1000m3|Bose700|sennheiser HD 450BT Review|Sennheiser|Best Headphones review,2020-10-07 10:22:48.585846, these are the Sennheiser HD 450 BT wireless headphones but are they any good well let's take a closer look don't forget to hit the red button to subscribe and give this video a thumbs up and click the notification bell to get my next video first so my friends these are the Sennheiser wireless bluetooth headphones now what makes these a little bit more special than maybe some others is the fact that the price point they come in they offer active noise cancellation now these at the moment in the UK under 150 pounds and around 199 dollars in the US I will leave the latest link in the description so that you can check out the very latest price for whenever you're watching this video what makes these headphones interesting is the fact that you're getting over ear active noise canceling for around a hundred pounds or a hundred dollars less than some of the major brands now clearly as soon as you open the box one area that you'll see that they've saved money is not only the packaging but also the case that you keep them in it's very flimsy and it's not really gonna offer too much in the way of protection there's plenty of instructions but the good thing is is that it doesn't seem that they skimped at all on the quality of the actual headphones first impressions are that they look and feel absolutely first-class they look very similar to the leading brands and the build quality is almost identical is very very impressive as well as the black which I have sent hauser also do these in white and I do have to say these look the business and I've seen videos with the white versions and I think that they definitely look better and I'm a little bit gutted that Sen Hauser didn't send through those white ones for me to test anyway though these are still nice-looking and they feel really good quality as I mentioned earlier now a couple of things that you'll want to know is that these do pack down really small obviously you can use the case which I showed you earlier but it's fairly flimsy and so it won't offer that much protection but in terms of room for packing then these don't take up so much space at all now all of the controls are on the right ear cup so everything is there I'm going to go through those in just a second because again there's a couple of nice neat little features on there now also within the box I forgot to mention that you do also get your audio cable and your USB C charging cable you will be able to charge this to full within a couple of hours and it will last for 30-plus hours in fact in my test I got just over 31 hours in terms of full use when wearing headphones it's important that they are comfortable and you'll be pleased to hear wearing these was an absolute joy there's one little caveat that I would add and that is that the ear cups can get quite warm the headband is cushioned and again didn't feel like it was wearing on the top of the head which some headphones have done in the past but the cushioning was really good it felt very comfortable to wear however your ears do get a little bit warm in them so if you are prone to that then you may want to just consider taking these off and giving yourself some breaks now the build quality of these as I mentioned earlier they feel really robust and I think that they'll definitely survive the odd drop twist or sitting on them you can definitely give a little bit of robust twisting and it doesn't feel you don't hear any creaks any sounds of stress I wouldn't recommend you do this all the time guys but just to show you that they are fairly robust okay so I'm firing up the headphones now the one first test that I want to do is testing the microphone capability because for me that's a big feature being able to take calls and being heard clearly on the other person's phone as I mentioned earlier all of the controls are on the right air cup the first button on the left hand side which is slightly awkward to get to is to summon your Google assistant or Siri to the side of this you've got the toggle for skipping forward a track and back a track it's a really nice mechanism where you can push up to go forward a track down to back attract and then push in to play or pause and also this doubles as answering and rejecting calls and also putting them on hold to the side of this is the volume rocker and that is just straight forward up and down and then to the side of that is the USB charging port next along you have the port for the 2.5 millimeter audio cable and these sets of headphones come with a 2.5 millimeter to 3.5 millimeter cable so you can plug straight into your device whether that be a phone if it still has a port or some other device and then finally on the right hand side you've got your on/off and pairing switch and also this doubles up for active noise-cancelling when you first turn the headphones on it will go straight into bluetooth pairing mode if you want to get it into pairing mode at a later date then you turn it on and keep on pressing hold now to turn on active noise-cancelling you just need to press the button whilst the headphones are on now frustratingly you don't get an audio prompt to tell you that you're in anc mode obviously the most important thing about headphones is sound and I'm pleased to report that the sound quality delivered by these Sennheiser headphones is absolutely exceptional it is far better than the price of pointer suggests now don't get me wrong they're not perfect and I will come on to the failings of these headphones in just a second but if you are looking for rich sounds deliverable bass then you're definitely going to be pleased with these another nice and surprising feature with headphones at this price is that you do get an accompanying app in here you can go in and change the equalizer settings and give yourself two different tones now I haven't played too much with this but it's just a nice feature to have now you may well be considering on purchasing these headphones but I do think there's some other important information that you need to be aware of firstly bluetooth 5.0 this means that you can switch these headphones between different phones for instance because it's got that more modern type of Bluetooth there are no proximity sensors on these headphones and that means that when you take the headphones off it doesn't pause the music automatically and therefore you need to be aware of that and actually port it yourself that does come with an auxiliary cable and that means that you don't have to have power you don't have to have a charged battery in order for these to work you can just plug in the power cable or the auxiliary cable and work in the same way a wide set of headphones word the ANC is limited so the active noise cancellation I found it to be probably about a six out of ten it's definitely better than some of the cheaper brands that you get and some of the almost like the mock ANC but it's definitely no in there as good as the leading brands so have you expecting it to you be then you might be disappointed however and I come onto this on my last point for the value it's not bad the other thing that I think that you need to be aware of is if you've got a large head you may find these a little bit too tight I would say that these are for a medium sized head finally when it comes to value I definitely think that these are worth it but those extra features for this price point is really very very good somewhere friends when it comes down to take one of the biggest factors for me is value for money and I definitely think that you're getting that with these headphones the sound quality is incredibly good and very very surprising but they're not without issues as I've already mentioned but for the money they do represent really good value for money I'll leave my links in the description for you to check out for yourself guys let me know also there's other headphones in this price range that you would recommend and I'll see whether I can get hold of them thank you so much for watching this video and I do look forward to seeing you on the next

headphones,2020-10-07 10:22:48.585880," [Music] hey what's up guys this is Jayden for gizmo x and you're watching a full review of the shamisen me super bass wireless headphones these were recently launched at the Amazon panda sale and we had done the unboxing on the next day but we were asked by a lot of people to do the full review if you are also told by others that you haven't done the filter and this is just the unboxing and that's wrong but we had to use it for a few days before coming up with the final judgement about it and these are priced at 1,800 rupees these are on-ear headphones and they come with those flexible or the adjustable ear muffs and the bluetooth as well as the word option that's the ox option it has a battery life of for 20 hours of playback with the 400 mah battery that comes with a 40 mm dynamic driver is given here for the sound output but let's start with the design to start the review so first off with the build quality I felt it's good first thing that is like this that it's light in weight so it's not heavy at all and the good thing is that since it's not heavy you don't have to you won't ever feel uncomfortable with that but on the other side being light isn't the only thing that would make it feel comfortable it's also the flexibility of this extendable arm or this on that II that goes over the head so how flexible is this is what I'm showing you it is actually flexible but then these are so hard in a way that when you keep wearing it for long hours I I was in a flight for about two and half hours and then I wore it continuously in the cab as well which was about a four hours of continuous usage and I felt that yeah it was a bit painful on the ears the fact that these earmuffs are not as large compared to the ear sizes these actually sit over the ears and that is sometimes painful for most of the users for me it was painful it did you that a little bit of a discomfort but if you listen to the music for about one hour and then taking a break that won't be an issue so if you are someone who's a or audio file and keeps listening to music all the time I don't think this would be a proper fit for you you should go with something that has larger ear muffs and something that has enough size for you years to go in and sit there properly and adjust itself here it's not that not the case that way because once you extend these and make the set over your head this is the area where it would to go over the ears and then press the ears so this these are quite comfortable actually this this would be not that hard but still for a longer use I felt that they were not so good so you know where they are light which is one of the good things but otherwise they are going to be discomforting for users for longer run and the second thing is I wore it and took it off for quite a lot of times already now because I've been using these headphones extensively and no other headphones even 4G mobile for gaming for music for watching web series everything was on this for the last few days and I felt these kind of things are something that Xiaomi should have actually taken a good control or a good measure of so this this adhesive is loose use you can see that this is not even a full week of usage and this adhesive is already giving up and this foam area here is actually lifting itself off I don't know how long will this day but I can say that it's a bit poorly made that way or it could be a quality control issue on this particular headset and it might be better on the other ones but you can clearly see that the odyssey of there was loose even here you can listen to the sound here that is a dress here that gets looser and whenever you try to pull it but here in this this case it was not here because these are the buttons on the right side when I weighed them and always when you lift keep it over the head this way you try to adjust it after you wear it and that is when it keeps getting loose with this adhesive and the foam is actually loose here so I don't like the make of this one in that way because it should have been made better though that's the case I feel that it should be the case only with my headphones and I feel I hope it's not with every other me super miss headphones that others buy so that's it with the build quality next with the major one that's the audio quality frankly I like the audio quality the output on every kind of genre that I heard on the pop music on something that I heard classical the regular Bollywood music everyone was good the bass levels were actually pretty good and sometimes they also felt a bit too harsh I mean heavy on the bass levels what the name says super bass that is the case here it's actually super busy and the base levels where you can't control them so that's one thing unless you have proper equalizing in your phone you counted is the base levels and I couldn't do that on my real me X as well as on the Redmond k20 Pro I tried it on both of them I couldn't do that so I felt that when I was playing the pubsey mobile game why is the audio sound the sounds that come out when people are walking around when this car driving or those things it was pretty perfect but when there was some shooting happening the base levels were actually like hitting the years every bullet sound that comes when you try to shoot someone the base levels are pretty high and I couldn't control it so that was one base something I I felt that it's too heavy on the ears and otherwise if you are listening to the music it's all perfect I felt that these were pretty fine with the audio quality the audio levels can be adjusted into as one is on the headphones and other is on the phone so if you are using these buttons here it doesn't mean that it would change the same on the phone as well so it's double control you can control it here and then you can control it on the phone as well so that's a good thing actually you don't have to control it only on one side you can reduce the audio here and if you feel that it's still high you can reduce that on the phone as well or if it's low you can increase it on the phone so that way with the controls now we'll go to the connectivity next because of that control part I talked about connectivity is very good actually I tried quite a lot of Bluetooth earphones in the recent times I felt that these are the most easiest to connect to first thing is you need to just press the power button for three seconds and it would turn on the headphones and also say that it's about two pair so there are two things power on and pairing is what it says and you will see that it instantly connected here so though it was already paired so that's that he said it connected but the other reason is that when I try to pair it with a newer phone that after the real makes I tried connecting this to the red mackay 20 Pro it took the same amount of time to show the headphones they're ready for pairing and it took so it takes only a few seconds for the entire fading to complete and next part was about the battery percentage which the user manual said that it might not work with Android phones but it did work with both of them so it shows the battery level 90% here after some amount of usage so and after that you can control the phone audio the media audio and also the contact sharing these are the things that you can do with the phone's connectivity on the headphones and the pairing was pretty easy and even the continuity is pretty easy about 20 feet to 25 feet is what I tried and the connectivity was seamless there was no disconnection there was no loss in connectivity anywhere and that was good I felt that with the connectivity part Xiaomi actually bet most of the other headphones because always I have an issue with Bluetooth headphones getting disconnected having issues with pairing sometimes it loses the connectivity while the music is on so that way I felt that it was not good on the other other headphones but with the Xiaomi is Super Bass wireless headphones it was pretty brilliant that way next with the wired thing so there are two options anyway as I said you have the wireless Bluetooth audio as well as the aux audio here so with the aux now let's talk about Bob t-mobile if you use ox and the wired option it's going to be as good as any other regular headphones and it's going to work perfectly with Bluetooth there is little isn't latency but compared to the other headphones I find that this has lesser latency and the millisecond gap that you see whenever you try to play it on the phone with Bluetooth and when you are playing the game that is an important thing the latency on Bluetooth whenever you try to play games with the Bluetooth headphones if someone shooting at you and you realize that it was already a short and then you heard it on the headphones there's not a lot of gap here but I would always used suggest to use the wire rather than the Bluetooth option unless you have a phone that doesn't have the 3.5 mm headset jack in that case you might have to buy an adapter one thing I could attest is that whether it will work with the 3.5 mm to type C adapter but on the regular phones which has the headset jack it did work pretty well and the last thing now before we ended two things actually battery and the noise cancellation so nice cancellation is something that people had asked me about whether these earphones headphones have noise cancellation they don't have it on paper so you won't see any noise cancellation but when I was in the flight the engine noise always is loud you that and when I wore these headphones and played some music that has quite a lot of bass levels I felt that there was quite a lot of noise that get muffled and the external noise was not that much audible people around me that we're talking I couldn't hear them properly only because of the fact that these are quite tight and in that way there's no active or passive noise cancellation done by the headphones but these earmuffs pretty tightly and snug on the ears in that way the external noise was not that much audible but there is no actual noise cancellation being done by this means super bass wireless headphones and the last one was about the battery life so battery life is claimed to be about 20 hours of playback time I played it continuously for about 10 to 12 months and the battery left was about 40% 38% or somewhere around that is what I last saw so it's almost as good as it was claimed to be about 20 hours and it has bluetooth 5.0 and also the last thing there was some question about the connectivity with the PC some said that it isn't working with the Mac Mac's audio output that's the headphone jack it actually works pretty well if you are using the Ox cable given in the Box packaged and connected with a Mac it actually works pretty well there is no issue at all that way so this was the full review of the me Super Bass wireless headphones I think I might have missed a few points if you still have any other questions you want me to check something about these headphones to let me know in the comments I'll try to answer them and I'll do actually check before I answer and I'll try to give my entire thought about it for that particular question so I hope you liked this video I hope I answered most of the questions that you guys had about these headphones and yeah what the competition as well there were a couple of headphones that people wanted to compare me with this and those were the sony MDR XB 450 also there was the board rockers fight and I frankly don't have both of them I am going to order them and I'll try to compare all the three so that you get a clearer understanding of which one has a better audio output though the board walkers has all the lesser battery life of 10 ours is what the company has claimed and there is 54 driver on the and this 50 mm driver on this one is one a while compared to the 40 mm one on this one so I feel there should be quite a lot of difference all the three so I'll try to compare them frankly I haven't used them so I won't give my judgment about those two compared to this one so this was the full review of the me super baseball has headphones I hope you liked this video if you do do share and subscribe to this one I in some mode thank you for watching and see ya next video [Music]"

510,nOjTc-QIzUM,TecH MoE,UCWv82xIbPaBORTlfG5cdK-g,The Best Crushers Yet? Skullcandy Crusher Evo Wireless Bass Headphones!,"What's up TM Nation?! In this video I provide you all with a review and unboxing of the newly released Skullcandy Crusher Evo bluetooth wireless headphones. These feature soft and plush earpads, playback controls, a microphone for voice calls, up to 40 hours of playback time, and 10 minutes of charging will give you about 3 hours of battery time .The upgraded design is nice, the earpads and headband are very comfortable on the head. You can use these with the Skullcandy app to personalize your sound or choose from 3 different EQ modes which are movie, music, and podcast. The podcast setting is flat and airy so I never use it, the music and movie modes are nice though. The Crusher Evo's are not just about bass, they have impressive highs and mids and overall, they are more balanced than you may think. These are the truth and the kings of bass until someone dethrones them. Thanks for watching!

your boy tecmo here again back with another review on unboxing and today is a special day you guys know when the crushers drop and they come in everything stops and y'all that have been watching me for a while know that i pretty much own all of the crusher headphones except for the older models that were wired and used batteries believe it or not i did own a pair of the original skull crushers back in the day and since i purchased that pair of headphones years ago i never found another headphone company that could deliver that subwoofer base so needless to say over the years i have amassed a small crusher collection as you can see right here here are my crusher wireless headphones still working no issues here we have my crusher 360s still working without a problem i love these headphones and the newest pair besides the crusher evos these other crusher ancs still sound amazing no problems and now i have the newest pair the crusher evos and man so far these live up to the crusher name but that brings me to my next point which is that i know not everybody wants to spend 200 or more for a good pair of bass headphones of course in this video i'm gonna mainly focus on the evos as they are the newest out of the bunch however the crusher wireless headphones and the crusher 360s may be viable options for you as they're always on sale you can usually find these for about a hundred dollars and these for about 150 and to make it even more interesting the crusher ancs now cost the same price as the crusher evos so i say all of that to say this it can be a little bit difficult to choose a pair of crushers if price to performance is your concern so in this video i'm going to try to help you guys out a little bit of course like i said i'm gonna focus on the evos but towards the end of the video i will do a little comparison so you know how each pair of headphones stacks up for now focusing on the crusher evos they retail for 199 and you have some pretty impressive features at that price you'll get about 40 hours of battery life with these on a single charge to personalize your sound feature through the app you have usb type c for charging and you have built-in mics for voice calls i'll go over more of the specs with the evos and do all of my normal tests a little later on in the video but so that you know what you'll get if you decide to pick a pair up let me unbox them for you alright so taking a look at the box you get nice presentation with the evos and that's nothing new the last few pairs of crushers that i've picked up really had premium packaging and when you get them you feel like you're unboxing something special once you open up the box you'll see that you have information about the crusher evos on the inside flap and then on the other side you have some quick start instructions to get you up and running moving right along inside of the box you get pretty much everything you would need to put you on your path to deafness this includes your user manual and warranty documentation a usb type-c cable to charge the headphones you get a 3.5 millimeter cable if you want to use them in wired mode and a nice carrying bag with the headphones inside i must say that although the back is not going to provide a lot of protection i like the design the inside of the bag is really soft and it's made out of like a sheepskin filling material which gives the bag a really nice touch now taking a look at the crusher evos the design is really nice in my opinion they do look pretty similar to the crusher anc headphones but they do have some differences which i'll touch on a little bit later as you can see i did pick up the black pair just to keep everything uniform but you do have the chill gray color as well i do own the indie fuels in the chill gray color and i must say that the color does grow on you over time the overall construction of the crusher evos feels sturdy in the hands out of the box i don't hear any creaks or anything of that nature and they are relatively flexible with the design of the crusher evos you can also lay them completely flat on a surface or fold them up if you want to most headphones only give you one or the other but if those are concerns for you they got you covered for battery life with the evos just to recap you'll get about 40 hours on a single charge i just got them so i can't tell you just how accurate that number is but judging from my other crusher headphones they usually get pretty close to that advertised number these also do feature quick charging though so only 10 minutes worth of charging will get you about 3 hours worth of use they're also using bluetooth 5.0 so pairing them to any bluetooth device is simple and only takes a moment all that you have to do is hold down the orange power button and that will put them into pairing mode from there simply find the crusher evos on your device connect to them and you're good to go the connection in terms of walking distance for me has been pretty good i can usually walk about 60 or so feet away from my device before i start getting some crackling and then anything beyond that is usually when they disconnect in terms of latency i haven't experienced any type of lag watching youtube videos or movies on my iphone 11 or my galaxy s20 i have watched media on both devices and everything seemed to be pretty synced up the crusher evos do have built-in mics so you can take voice calls directly from the headphones i've made a few voice calls using them and i think that the call quality is respectable but so that you guys can judge for yourselves let's take a listen all right guys so right now i have the crusher evos paired to my iphone 11 i'm not going to do any type of editing to this audio so this should give you a pretty good idea of how you'll sound using these for boys calls for playback controls the crusher evos have three physical buttons on the right ear cup and you do have all of your playback controls with these which is nice you can control your volume your tracks and your calls to control the intensity of your base you simply use the slider on the left ear cup and it's buttery smooth you can slide it up and down pretty easily so you shouldn't have any issues dialing the base in the way that you want it now moving on to the way that the crusher evos fit on my head i have no complaints in terms of the comfort they have generous amounts of padding on the ear cups and for those of you that are bald like myself the padding on the top is sufficient earlier i did wear them for about an hour straight and i didn't have any ear fatigue or discomfort now if you're worried about sound leakage these are probably not the right headphones for you because they do leak a lot of sound but just so you guys have an idea of how much sound they leak when turned all the way up let's take a listen as i mentioned earlier you can change the sound with the crusher evos through the skullcandy app through the app you can choose from three different eq modes which are movie music and podcasts or if you want to use the personalized feature you can use this to optimize the sound based on your hearing when you go through this process the headphones will play different sounds and you tell the app which frequencies that your ears hear the process does take a minute or so to complete but once it's done your sound profile will be stored the crusher evos are also compatible with the tile app which is a nice feature if you ever can't remember where you put your headphones when you're using this feature and you get closer to the headphones the app will let you know and the volume of the chime will go down for me personally this feature is more helpful with earbuds but it doesn't hurt to have that feature with the headphones as well alright guys so now that you have an idea of what the crusher evos have to offer let's get into a little bit of a comparison and before i get into it let me just say this and cover this base i don't care which pair you pick up nobody does bass headphones like skull candy i have had a couple pair of the sony extra bass headphones and before you ask me now panasonic is also getting into the base game now i did try out their bass headphones and i wasn't impressed so first let's start with the oldest pair out of the bunch the crusher wireless headphones and these are not quite as refined as the others with these you will hear some creaks here and there even when they're brand new out of the box and one thing that i want to note for you guys is this is the only pair out of the bunch that has exposed speaker wires the overall sound signature with the crusher wireless headphones is dedicated to the bass although you will get some decent mids and highs at lower volumes they fall off quickly when you crank them up the bass is also very impressive at about 50 to 75 percent but as you crank them up it does get weaker even with all of that being said trust me the base that these provide is much more than you need the battery life with these is good at about 40 hours but remember they are older so you're going to get some older tech with the crusher wireless headphones you're going to get bluetooth 4.0 and they charge via micro usb if those are deal breakers for you keep that in mind but price wise you can usually find these for about a hundred bucks next in line are the crusher 360s and these are step up from the crusher wireless out of all four pair i like the design of these the most and a couple things set these apart from the pack first your base slider on the 360s is not a physical slider but you control it using your finger as you're going through the levels there are led lights on the side of the headphones that change based on the intensity this may not be a big deal to you but for me the design is nice for me the led lights add a nice little touch that's a little bit cooler than just having a normal slider the crusher 360s are a little bit newer so you're going to get bluetooth 4.1 they still charge using micro usb and the battery is decreased at 29 hours another feature that i like about the design of the 360s is you can see the battery life left on your headphones directly from the headphones you can see the battery left on the headphones at any time by simply pressing the button on the left ear cup for sound the 360s are going to be cleaner in terms of highs and mints than the crusher wireless headphones for the base you're also not going to get as big of a drop off when you crank them up price wise these are still a good value you can usually find them for about 150 bucks next we have the crusher anc headphones and this is the only pair out of the bunch that offers active noise cancelling the design with the ancs is different from the 360s and the crusher wireless headphones these have more rounded edges instead of the boxier look that you'll get with those older headphones the ancs are also newer so with them you'll get bluetooth 5.0 usb type-c for charging and like i said these are going to give you active noise canceling but it does come at the cost of battery life as these offer you about 24 hours sound wise the crusher ancs are a step up from the crusher 360s especially with the clarity the base is a little bit deeper and a little bit more punchy and it is going to maintain its strength at higher levels but base wise there is not a world of difference in between the 360s and the ancs the clarity is the big difference with the crusher ancs the highs and mids are more pronounced and they stay relatively clear when you max them out although most people will never feel the need to max these out you will get some distortion when you crank them up and as for the active noise cancelling it does work well with these but to be honest you really don't need it anytime that you have these headphones up 50 or more you're really not gonna hear what's going on around you price wise like i said earlier the crusher ancs now cost the same price as the crusher evos at 199 and now we arrive at the crusher evos and guys i'm gonna keep it as short and sweet as possible these are amazing for me these provide the best listening experience out of all of my crusher headphones the highs and mids are impressive and you don't get a big drop off even when you crank them all the way up also i am pleased with the amount of bass that you retain even when you max the bass slider out so far out of the three modes i pretty much leave these on movies mode the music mode is nice as well but for me the movies mode is where you get the most balance the sound profile that the app created for me doesn't sound that great so at this point i pretty much leave it off and i want to make it clear these headphones are not just about head rattling bass if you don't want that much bass and you just want to chill and relax simply push the slider down a little bit and you'll be all set you do not get a tiny or airy sound with these headphones so i'm saying just try them out i think you'll be impressed so that being said guys i hope this helps you pick your pair of crusher headphones like i said earlier if bass is your thing you won't go wrong with either pair but for right now the evos are my favorite but that's it for this video guys if you have any questions as always leave them in the comment section i'll try to get you an answer thank you guys for coming through and hanging out with me the support really does mean a lot until next time y'all be safe y'all stay positive and most importantly have a great day i'll catch y'all in the next one it's your boy tecmo and i'm out peace if you rock with the channel in your

516,PbGzrh3FxIk,AV Atmos,UCIt01rROdBNVDfVr8owm8sQ,X by Kygo Xellence true wireless headphones Debuts with great ANC and 30hr playtime,"For the uninitiated, X By Kygo is a dedicated Norwegian headphone specialist with international DJ, songwriter and producer Kygo at the helm. Every headphone’s sonic performance is fine-tuned by Kygo and his team of expert audio engineers – and Xellence is the firm's newest release. 

Visually, the illuminated X is a striking aesthetic, and you can also expect active noise-cancellation, your own personal hearing ID using Mimi Sound Personalization technology (the free Android/iOS X by Kygo App also uses real-time adjustments which promise to ""tailor the Xellence’s sound to your needs"") and 30 hours of continuous playtime; 10 from the buds (8 hours with ANC on) plus an extra 20 hours from the wireless charging case. If you’re in a rush, a quick 15-minute charge via USB-C should provide two hours of juice, too.

The earbuds are IPX5-rated for sweat and water resistance, so they’re protected from sudden spells of rain or your weekly spin class. 

The touch capacitative buttons on the earbuds boast easy playback control, call-handling or access to Siri and Google Now voice assistants on the go.

Bluetooth 5.0, aptX and AAC codecs are supported, which should equal a rock-solid connection and CD-quality wireless audio streams from any device.

The X by Kygo Xellence is available now in black or white finishes with matching charging case, priced at £179 ($239).

have the micro here in my hand wireless gear bones light and this is the global version of these headphones xiao wireless come to me it is also known as good Chinese version It is known as air two projects for two principles, it gives me each name each new device is already a cell phone or headphones well in this case well this is the global version as I tell you my true wireless air bones light Sorry it's for the English but hey here we have it well without more to say then I'm going to unbox the unboxing while I'm mentioning you I got these wireless headphones for $ 29 In the express platform, 29 dollars is only the cost of those sold hearing aids but also in this case you have to take into account what is the shipping cost against glued is very sealed I already am taking out and here I have it to see to see one year later two years later at last I already have it better here and I start open to see what it contains and before removing the hearing aids from the box then we go for that part of where that says the tribe characteristics wireless stereo well as the global version told you not here we have to it was in english and it says authentic wireless stereo sound yes too has call noise cancellation has good supports fast charging and says fabes quick connection connection as it comes with a button on the charging base that says touch control touch control ok now I'm going to proceed to remove and we have around here go go I see it really flawless fine so far so I can see they are perfect now and follow what the little arrow says then remove this from this part and let's see let's hold The headphones or I don't have it around here I leave it here and the other here too now I'm going to remove what is the base the charging box and remove its respective plastic force here we can see the xiao logo ming that comes in the box box plastic yes now the camera does not focus now yes wow aesthetically I see it perfect I love it if it looks like to apple spots but here we have it in the version good in itself to me If I am going to check if I have nothing else in here in this part of the box and then this does include what is charging cable since the air dots and the Well priests do not include it well I will leave you the link of the video of the boxing of the airbags that or better known with the name of the version global micro wireless dear boots basic yes well I'll leave you here the link will be appearing up here we have here the cable there is nothing else I will remove this but here we have the manual if I do not I'm wrong because we don't know that it came out in nobody so we threw it here here we have more pads of different sizes I don't know if we can appreciate well Yes now I'm going to open well I'm going to break to be able to show you and to know how many countries the camera is focusing on to see if and from what it seems we have in different sizes two to three additional pairs for not breaking the whole bag as friends said these headphones well wireless those wireless headphones got it for 29 dollars only the price that the hearing aids have been without taking into account and not even without shipping since good for the according to the time varies the shipping but to me when I bought it together with the airbags good with the micro wireless starbuks basic s since it has been purchased or the hearing aids shipping I like 41 dollars as you know on each platform the shipping cost It changes according to the time not the date you buy it but that is the price of these headphones 29 dollars if here in peru lima peru they sell these same if If they are original, I have seen in an importing gallery that they sell it 280 soles and if I remember correctly online I saw it at 260 soles yes well it depends on each one where to buy it where to buy it but as I say and recommend always buy original products well here we have good two pads silicone we have two other two so we have three pairs one two three although it can serve as a spare in in case this gets lost, I know there are some and they don't stain well here we have spare well this I'm going to put it aside and you can the charging cable from type the camera focuses input type c if it is very long let's say plastic removal here we are talking about about 40 centimeters 40 centimeters of cable well the good thing is that charging cable cable is included because we have headphones yes the truth is that I see it and I love them personally they are very beautiful the truth aesthetically all the finish well I see it well I love how I repeat them again for this part we have what are the charging pins and really for its price I will focus again as I tell you if it is worth it Well it depends on you, I buy it here locally or if it is import or also the price of those audios not according to your country well I'm going to mention the functions since as I said here in the part in this part some of its characteristics [Music] says call noise cancellation to activate noise cancellation while listening to music or being in a call because the right earphone is fine we keep it pressed for about 23 seconds and it will activate what is noise cancellation if you also have another double tap function double tap to be able to pause or play when we are listening to music ok and will not answer yes is that we only give it a touch this good this option I imagine what I put because if we are accommodating the headphones in the ear well coincidentally we will have to load and not be stopping the music I imagine that if what he has done is not put any option do nothing if there is a touch and on the left side well in this hearing aid on the left if we also hold down Well, we will automatically pull the noise cancellation and if we give two touch because we will activate google so agree can now be a small test connecting it to the a3 I have around here to see how much it is there it sounds like this without mentioning them before, because here we have the charging base not well I see her well I really see her very pretty perfect all the riding has completely finished polished and as I was saying then if there is some kind of mishap or inconvenience in some of my videos as I said sometime you the followers because all the video then practically run are rare the times he edited the video and in order to make a more fluid video with ideas and not have a script to follow good to my comfort i like to make videos this way I hope you like it and you can value the effort because we have the input type I know well that we have seen although it comes with the type d cable and these buttons well this button that we see here is to synchronize with the device in this case like this one I have 3 the second I'm going to pair the device with the headphones I'm going to press the button I have the gross activated on the phone to see if it is that syncs I'm already pressing there we can see that a small light has been lit if we are walking true and here the phone was looking for one let's see let's see if it can detect but again I'm going to press so as not to be long the video I am going to pass it to a second and resumed when I have friends well linked at last after many Attempts to try to connect you can know the moment as I could count them the headphones were inserted here in the box and each I took out the other one I tried to link them they did not appear on the device I do not see no I recognized myself and you can recommend it well based on my experience that has happened to me now always take out the first what is the right handset and then the left and it was just like that when he appeared on my cell phone now I have it connected here we can see my tw yesterday pons light active 70% of battery and now I'm going to stop playing music so you can see how loud its volume is and well look we are experiencing a small error that when I have it out of the ears because it does not reproduce nor do we make that later the sensors do not it is handled here but well already with use and I have not already used it because for something is unboxing yes and really for the few minutes that I have had the sound quality that is good is really worth it for the price as I say well and well this loaded base as we can see without the headphones if we leave it like that, because they are pulled back in this case with the headphones inside if they stand up ok then and well friends the video is getting very long again and I hope I have tried to cover all the possible characteristics and recommendations that It may interest you, I hope you really like it and in conclusion I I recommend these micro wireless earbuds the bronx line well friends I hope you really like video and daniela and subscribe car see you until next time"

headphones|range|battery life|sound quality|charger|usb|aux|Walmart|air pods|ear buds|music,2020-10-07 10:22:48.586583, all right i got these on groove headphones um they was about 15 bucks pretty cheap up to 14 hours of play time we're going to see how true that is on ear headphones bluetooth um i already opened them by the way this is actually after i already used them so i'm going to show you how to video of everything but the bluetooth technology built-in headphones um i think it said 33 foot range i checked the range and i went all through the gym with these headphones and they did not even cut off so for a cheap set of headphones the range is actually the best i've had um high definition sound that's true um let me tell you something about the sound though the sound the volume don't go that loud but it does sound very good on lightweight collapsible easy storage uh kind of flimsy in the hand but on the head it feels pretty good on the basics the specs y'all can read that if you want i don't care what's in the box one pair of wireless on-ear headphones um 13.5 millimeter aux cable um 3.9 foot um a micro usb charging cable i don't think it has the um the plug-in piece but it has the cable that's all i need you know i said i got so many plug-ins and so many devices that don't need a plug-in piece um quick start guide pretty good headphones for about 15 bucks all right y'all it's 2 39 um i was listening to that mp rebel um petey crack um i'm driving right now i'm late i'm supposed to be at the gym right now so i didn't have enough time to like sit here but it's just a time and a bit of a i literally just got out of bed i didn't even brush my teeth but i'm driving already um yeah gotta hit the gym it's called dedication all right i got time i'm trying to make it so i have time to get when i get home before i go to work um to be able to take a shower freshman to do all that before i get to work maybe even have a snack i don't know if not i'ma just have a longer fast during the boat we can explain that later that's another video but we're gonna go to the gym and i'm gonna tell you how these headphones sound and feel all right y'all like i said right now it's like 2 40 2 am i go to the town i go to this gym at this time a little early i'm like 40 minutes late i woke up a little late but uh i go to the gym at this time to avoid people um i said that my last video for people that have been around they know this already about me but i'm only saying this for people that you know brand new or need maybe maybe this is bad advice for some people you know i'm saying it is kind of dangerous to go out at this time you know just getting out from your car and getting it to the gym you're sitting duck you're saying be ready you know what i'm saying watch your back you know this ain't for everybody i wouldn't recommend this for everybody you know i'm saying if you're not ready then don't do it you know what i'm saying but um that's not what this video is about um but that's not even why i cut my camera back on we almost there um a couple lights down and we're gonna hit the left we'll be there and uh what i'm saying is a lot of i'm just hoping that there's nobody there yesterday when i got there it was a couple of cars one duel um there's always that one dude it could be one dude in the gym and it'll be that one dude not particularly that guy but it's always that guy you know what i'm saying but uh what do they do they um how about i know i didn't pass it okay so where i go every day i get sidetracked by y'all but yeah um if you're trying to be above average that's what let me cut to chase you're trying to be above average you cannot be cool with going in the gym and not having good workouts every time yes you're gonna have some bad workouts but you can't be it can't be half of your workouts it can't be most of your workouts can't be none of that that's bad you know what i'm saying if you go to the gym people mess you up you you go in there you keep on going in there and not doing what you got to do yes you can kind of grow you can kind of blame yourself if you do that but at the same time yes and no people that ain't never been under that bar they don't know and people that have been under that bar but not as intensely oh yeah i see one truck one truck one pickup truck yeah man this is this is this is what i'm talking about one truck and i don't see the dual car i know exactly who it was the other day i don't see his car oh cool no literally people are in your way when you're lifting heavy weights the heavy weights are dangerous all right heavy weights are dangerous i don't care what nobody say that's what my morning face looks like um go ahead and grab my bag go ahead and grab my bag i got my sugary drink it's a great family with some uh ocean spray cranberry pomegranate in it leave that up there real quick y'all go probably see my messy car as i get my bag same thing like yesterday for people that have seen it ain't gonna show y'all too much but i'll get my bag real quick but i always say this and i said it yesterday and i'm gonna say it today if your car and your house is totally sparkling clean either you're not busy or you don't already made it or you got made to something i guess you already made it let's go in the gym real quick all right y'all here's what the headphones look like um first hand hold it kind of feels flimsy um it looks good i like the neon blue um i like the look of these headphones but you're getting what you paid for um the buttons are so close together though the power button is in the middle i kind of don't like the button layout but at the end of the day and by the way i need to cut my nails like i said my last video i'm starting to look like cardi b i don't cut my nails i just let them break i don't know why i always done that i keep them clean you know what i'm saying but uh here's your uh usb port and your aux core port whether you want to use the aux or you know what i'm saying or the bluetooth um here's what the top looks like i need to take that tape off i guess they're trying to protect the here's what it looks like with the tape off it's kind of grainy i like that feel kind of a quality feel for 14 15 cut my nails man what the heck uh okay we gonna bench press i'm gonna see how they feel on my head as i'm working out i'm still kind of warming up i didn't get every set because the video isn't about my workout it's about my look at my arms it's about the headphones okay i'm kind of awkwardly putting my head to see if they slip and i wouldn't recommend doing that um i'm just showing y'all especially with heavier weight this is a heavy weight to me as you see it's going up and down like butter um i can bench the heaviest dumbbells in this gym which is 125. um 125s might not sound a lot but you gotta think is in each hand and then dumbbells are way harder than barbell okay this is what they look like on my head by the way i'm using my galaxy s20 ultra phone um i kind of don't like that space in between my head but it's kind of cool i don't i don't know which i shake my head to see if they'll flop around nope holding onto my head pretty good yeah this is my morning face by the way i didn't say i didn't um comb my beard i'm not shaving no no i didn't call my beard but it's better than 99 of y'all out there that's looking yeah this is my wake-up beer this is what my beard looks like when i wake up out of bed okay yeah that's my mean face i'm rocking that music you know what i'm saying what was i listening to i think i was in bbc or something um okay i just did the 80 pound dumbbells they're over there um i didn't film it because it wasn't worth filming i want to film something heavier so i'm gonna go ahead i want to get to this rack over here the 105s to the 125s that's the heaviest dumbbells we have in the gym i don't recommend that for beginners don't do it just because you see me doing it you know i'm saying i've been in the gym for seven years i'm a natural but i've been in the gym for seven years but i'd be cool if i only get to the 95s or 100s um here's the light dumbbells over here if you lift these tens over here leave the people that is lifting over there alone all right please you know it takes way more focus okay we gonna go with these 90s i kind of want to go with the 85s uh i don't know man up man let me go and put these 80s back and i'm gonna grab these 90s you know what i'm saying man up i'm gonna go ahead and do flat bench i did all my inclines okay that right there you need to focus because if you drop one of these on your toes right there i'm wiping the sweat off my hands um if you drop one of these on your toes or if you drop these on your face um you're gonna have a bad time man i dropped a ten pound plate on my foot one time ten pounds and my foot was so swollen it felt like a hammer hit my foot but you roll your shoulders back retracted scalpel kick back bam nineties i don't know why that first uh rep looks ugly but they like butter man like butter it's ain't nothing i don't know um my sugary drinks and my eating habits lately it's kind of giving me a gut so i kind of probably need to um slow down i don't want to bulk up too fast but i did a couple reps i didn't do a lot of reps why because i want to go up and wait this is the difference okay these are their 90s and those are i think that's a 15 or is that a 10. that's a 15 um pound dumbbell this is the difference a lot of people look too different the heaviness the solidness the size this right here and this right here are two different weights that's not the heaviest dumbbell in the gym that's not the lightest but look at this i can grab this i can do it like that i can throw it i can actually throw it if i want to those 90s i'm not doing that with those that's a whole different animal right you know what i'm saying i'm just speaking to the beginners and by the time you get to these heavier weights you want to do really good form this this is how you pick up a heavy weight yeah you use your whole body it's a compound movement just putting the dumbbell back over there now i should not be dropping them on the floor by the way a lot of people do it and they pick and choose who they want to pick on if i break them i pay for them you know what i'm saying but um yeah so here are the 100s i think cause these are hundreds of 105s i think these are the oh this is the scene i want to point out i'm taking a very long time to even get started i made a mistake of see how i screwed up a little bit i only scooted up a little bit i needed to scoot it up a lot more but somebody had caught my attention trying to wave at me and talk to me and this is what i mean for people that don't understand what i'd be saying like yo leave people alone in the gym look i'm thinking everything is okay everything was okay until i laid down see how my head is off the bench i am not benching like that especially with heavy weight that is bad for and you can get injured by doing that a lot of people don't bench because they torque their rotator cuffs awkwardness leads to injury awkwardness plus heavy weights equals injury all right so i'm like nah man and like i regroup i thought about it i'm like yeah i'm going back in um put my listen to some music okay the 105s that's what i was lifting some old guy just kept on bothering me so you know i'm like yeah get my game face back on this is real good music go back in look at this this is how it looks to put these weights back see how heavy that is you got to really have a technique just to put your weights back when you're lifting heavy unless you weigh about 400 pounds mass moves mass i weigh it might look like i weigh a little more because i'm full right now but i weigh only like 1 79 180 give or take right now um yeah these are heavy here to here is very heavy it's different you know people are you crying no i ain't crying i'm a man up and i'm gonna lift the same weights matter of fact i'm going heavier these right here are the hundreds and tens i made sure i consciously made sure i scooted all the way up so when i laid back my head is going to be on the bench right look at this the headphones by the way are holding up good the bluetooth the range of these headphones i meant to get a scene of that too but my track of thought was all the way off i meant to get a scene of me uh how far the gym is i walked all the way to the bathroom the locker room the 110s that wasn't a fail a fail is when you can't do it i decided not to do it this is voiced over i muted everything out dude was on the side of me you can't see him he's on the other side of my camera holding the conversation with me while i got on headphones and with heavy weight in my hand y'all don't get it man i'm telling you man y'all do not get it so i'm thinking like man should i just go down and try those or should i go i'm definitely not going up these are the 125s this is the heaviest dumbbells we got in the gym right the headphones did very good by the way i just wanted to show that this hair this is a headphone video man um but it's still disappointing i still got some good reps and stuff i didn't show every set i was trying to show the dude he had left all right y'all that's all said and done um under the circumstances i did get a good workout in i'm still mad i just didn't get my heavy sets that i wanted which really don't matter you know i'm saying i just want to prove to myself that i'm not even prove to myself because there's a difference between building your strength and testing your strength i'm trying to build my strength to build your strength you do have to go heavy you know what i'm saying testing your strength that's when you're maxing that's when you lift in as much as you possibly can if i was testing my strength i would have lifted that weight regardless but real lifters we don't test our strength often you know what i'm saying we don't max off you might see me doing singles or doubles or triples low reps higher weight but at the same time that's not a max but uh building your strength that's different you know what i'm saying like the singles doubles triples maxing is when you lifting the ultimate amount of weight that you can lift for either one wrap or multiple reps but the ultimate amount of reps so you can't hit another rep that's maxing you know that's two different ways of maxing there's a difference um let me show you guys something man got my song rooftop i don't know if y'all can see that digging in the scene with the gangster lean but there's a difference between lifting heavy and maxing um i'm not gonna go too heavy if i don't feel like i should starting my joining up with the keyboard man it looks so dirty i got to clean my car i just want to show y'all what time it is real quick okay copyright but it's uh almost 4 30. i got to hurry up and get home um i'm gonna try to have time to eat real quick let's put y'all up here real quick while i'll talk to y'all i'm gonna probably i would face towards me but then i would have to turn the camera on i had to turn the light on and it's two three o'clock it's still dark out i don't want the light on in my car while i'm driving down the street that's a clean easy way to get pulled over and with everything going on you know what i'm saying i don't know everybody um but you might run into the wrong one you know i'm saying that i don't want that i got everything licensed registration i comply or whatever but that be the ones that end up happening too so at the end of the day you can say what you want believe what you want the proof is in there you know what i'm saying but uh yeah um you got too many grown people with the spike and type mentality grown man it was two grown men way above my age in the gym you know i'm saying way above my age you should learn about it and get away from people a lot of people be like oh well they might be just trying to you know or they're lonely or it don't matter at the end of the day when you see somebody doing something that could potentially injure if you drop that hundred pound dumbbell on your face i'm actually if you drop that hundred pound dumbbell on your face what do you think is going to happen and a lot of people will say well you shouldn't lift those yes i should yes i clearly should because i want to miss you if you're not on a mission if if this isn't your lifting weights is your thing you're not i don't expect you to understand but the easiest way to understand if it's not your thing is think about something that is your thing what if you like makeup you know what i'm saying you know what i'm saying you like makeup if you like makeup dude what if i just came to your house and tore up all your makeup or if you like music if you do music you got you spent all your money on a studio and every time you go in there and try to rap or sing or whatever i go in there and i just be in your way or i tear up your studio like yeah that's literally what you trying to do to me you know i'm saying when you you come up to me when i'm in the gym and you stop at me or they don't even man dog two two things that gets them the most is when i put my camera down ready to record they try to you know catch my attention or when i go heavier when i was lifting them warm up reps that y'all see me doing they didn't bother me they even look my way you know what i'm saying like you got to calm yourself down i understand certain things might be exciting to you but you gotta come as a grown man you gotta calm yourself down you know what i'm saying and if you if you're so inspired if you're so i only know the words right now but if my camera is what's making you act like that you gotta remember like dawg this is 2020. the 99 of us got camera on our phones but 99 of us got smartphones you could do the same thing i'm doing put your camera down to make a video about what you're doing you know what i'm saying every video turns into a rant at the end i can't help it though man i don't have to put this at the end but you know what though man comment like subscribe share holler back at your boy peace

Headphones are a pair of small loudspeaker drivers worn on or around the head over a user's ears. They are electroacoustic transducers, which convert an electrical signal to a corresponding sound. Headphones let a single user listen to an audio source privately, in contrast to a loudspeaker, which emits sound into the open air for anyone nearby to hear. Headphones are also known as earspeakers, earphones[1] or, colloquially, cans.[2] Circumaural ('around the ear') and supra-aural ('over the ear') headphones use a band over the top of the head to hold the speakers in place. Another type, known as earbuds or earpieces[1] consist of individual units that plug into the user's ear canal. A third type are bone conduction headphones, which typically wrap around the back of the head and rest in front of the ear canal, leaving the ear canal open. In the context of telecommunication, a headset is a combination of headphone and microphone.

welcome back to my channel so in today's video i'm going to be doing a uh a review of the skullcandy cess um truly wireless headphones now this is more of a one-year later review as these are um 2019 headphones and they came out um i think april of 2019 i do believe i'll correct myself on the screen right there or there anywhere on the screen now if you are a returning subscriber you you've probably noticed that the setup is different and it is um you can see there's a little bit of shadows in the lighting that's because one of my lights that i was using just happened to you know not want to work anymore so i guess we're just gonna have to deal with the shadow but hopefully in the next few videos um that will be fixed and there won't be a shadow actually this light might help hold on i hope it did absolutely nothing but it's done so actually hold on anyway let's get into the video now i have the headphones right here now you can see like just by looking at it uh it's a pretty bulky case it's um it's about as um about as thick as the airpods box and nearly as thick as the galaxy buds box so they're not they're not like they're not um the what do you call it skinny type of headphones um they are they are a more premium feeling type of plastic although these were 75 headphones they're not like the most expensive but they're a little bit more expensive than raycons but at the time raycons weren't out when these came out so that's why i got them and i continued to use these um i had to send these in for repair and i've never got haven't gotten them back same with these both of them are in repair and i've dropped these and haven't haven't had the cinnamon repair only seen some minor issues which we're going to talk about so you may have noticed that there is tape right here um that tape is there because there is a crack right here and the hinge is broken but i don't blame skull candy for this because um i'm very hard on them and this actually fell from a balcony um a one-story balcony onto concrete below so um and for it to only sustain one crack right here um and it wasn't even where the hinge was the hinge broke because of the force but it works perfectly fine you can see it's the book actually can't see that at all yeah i've got to get i've got to fix this light lighting issue but actually that's a little better but you can see right there it's a little broken but it does they do continue to work obviously i don't really need the top for it because i don't really carry them around with me anymore because i have um i use wired headphones i use the um samsung akg ones because i don't feel like buying new ones right now but anyway the case is held up pretty well other than that minor drop one other thing is battery life is still pretty good battery life advertised was about four hours and it's i'd say it lasts about three now as after using it for a while and batteries deplete after a little bit so it's expected normal wear and tear but you could still buy these new now as of sound quality um i uh i don't know i can't really tell a difference between them and the galaxy but there's a minor difference um the air pods sound slightly better um the airpods have less bass these have more bass um the airpods are a little like they're open open in headphones so they're not that bassy now these are ak these are by akg so obviously these sound better which they do but it's not a noticeable difference that sounds better with the i don't it's not that noticeable so i got these they broke instantly um they broke they were broken out of box and these were also broken out of box um but they i did get to use them for a little bit um so anyway let's talk about the size which is one downfall if i can get this box open hold on i hate apple boxes well i don't hate them i like them actually pretty creative but um extremely hard to open why is it so hard there we go no oh there's no insert in here but um there's no you know you you've always you obviously know what airpods the size of airpods are and these are definitely bigger um so that's why and you can tell um the packaging is a little um better on apple's ends just wanted to mention that now you can see here this is where um the galaxy buds would have gone and you can see this um with a little extra room to spare doesn't fit so they're quite a bit bigger than your average galaxy buds they're even bigger than the raycons as i have checked the measurements so they're pretty big headphones um that's probably going to do it for this review the headphones have held up really well the battery life and the headphones is advertised um seven hours of play i do believe it lasts about six nearly a full day with the minimum well with medium usage because i listen to music a lot and the microphone on these um it's it's not the best uh um these these little uh one of these five dollar warrant headphones um have a better microphone but these sound these are trash i just use these for extra i keep them around just in case i do end up somehow breaking these i gotta say this is the nokia 3310 equivalent of headphones because this the case i like the case it's nice and bulky although there is a little extra room they could have used two minutes to lower the thing but the case is bigger for better battery so the battery is obviously better on the galaxy but it's six hours so that's less than these um i do believe the charging case is um okay it does not say but i do believe the charging for that is five hours so that's an advantage with these anyway that was to review i hope you liked the review um i 100 recommend these if you're looking for headphones now there's a few other headphones that i'm going to be getting and looking into like a few off of amazon that are from brands that no one's ever that no one's really heard of i'm going to be buying a few wish headphones too to compare them to and i might even do a video soon about fake airpods which i guess will be fun which airport which fake airpods is closest to the real ones anyway thank you for watching follow my social medias they will both be linked down below or right there i'll put it right there i don't know i haven't figured out the handle thing yet thank you for watching have a nice day goodbye [Music]

This new super lightweight, brightly coloured true wireless headset from Encafire is one of the most unusual I have yet tried. But is it any good?

There used to be a time when you had to pay plenty to get decent quality True Wireless Earbuds but the introduction of Bluetooth 5.0 seems to have changed all that. Before Bluetooth 5.0 all but the most expensive TW earbuds would continually drop out, crackle, pop and generally prove more trouble than they were worth. As technology develops each pair is better than the last and this new set from ENACFIRE is one of the best I have tried for under £100.

In the rather upmarket box were the two buds together with three gel sets (one fitted), a short USB charging cable, and a well written but small and hard to read User Guide. Despite the light weight, everything has a distinctly premium and upmarket feel to it with the first-rate build quality without the weightiness of their upscale rivals. 

First time pairing could not be simpler and took just a few seconds. Subsequently, taking the buds from the case powers them on, they connect to each other and the phone automatically, returning them to the case turns them off and begins charging. The smaller than average 500mAh Lithium-ion case battery can still recharge the buds up to 6 times. There are LED’s on each bud to show charging and connection status and the buds will charge automatically when placed into the case.  Unlike with many smooth skinned rivals, these buds are easy to remove from the case, for me a major selling point.

These earbuds use the latest Bluetooth 5 technology which is currently only supported by the latest high-end smartphones but of course, they will also work with older Bluetooth devices. Bluetooth 5 adds longer range and greatly improves both the stability of the wireless connection and battery life. 

The buds are small, neat and comfortable to wear and will deliver up to eight hours of music per charge. Sound quality is excellent for a TW headset with a very decent level of bass together clean mid-tones and a sibilance free high end. The buds have the new alt-x audio codec for enhanced audio quality and thanks to the use of Bluetooth 5 have a stable and firm reception. They are rated as IPX8 water-resistant which means they can (in theory) be used underwater.

Calls were clear to hear and easy to make. The headset can accept or reject incoming calls and end them. Call quality was fine each end of the conversation with no dropouts or excessive background noise.

Each bud has a single soft touch button on it which can be used to end/reject calls, play/pause music, navigate tracks, alter volume and invoke your phone’s voice assistant. This works well and is easy to use.

For the £43.99 price, this headset compares very well with the high-end rivals I have tried as regards sound quality and features. Indeed, you would have to go a long way to find a better True Wireless Headset

584,w8EruV90ego,Logan Marshall,UC61CIbKyku5L9_bfX0zxsIQ,Best Headset Headphones for Microsoft Teams Jabra Evolve2 85 MS Wireless Headphones Link380a,,26,241,0.0,4.0,1.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w8EruV90ego/hqdefault.jpg,Microsoft teams|teams|best|2020|unboxing|review,2020-10-07 10:22:48.861541, hey guys this is a quick unboxing review of the jabra gn evolve 2 85 so let's open up and take a look [Music] so pretty wicked that the only thing in the box is the case i like the minimalist and frustration free packaging so this one's integrated with microsoft teams or certified just like the logitech brio 4k camera certified for teams and the cool thing about these headphones is you know when someone's on a call or they have a meeting and in teams or skype for business they have a little red dot beside their profile picture saying that they're on a call or or whatnot these headphones will actually um glow red on the side um and you know saying that you're busy you're on a call and although that's really interesting i'm i'm not sure that your co-workers around you you know even in a post covet office situation will see that oh his uh headphones are red um he's on a call um you know i'm not sure how well that will work but it is just fantastic that this feature exists so you got this nice matte finish really nice puff on the headband part you have your salt pack to dry things out so usb c 3.1 they give you an aux cable two bands airplane adapter i'll keep those in there i assume that's what it's there for i'm not sure what else this would be there for other than to make you a pocket so huge case compared to the bose 35 uh quiet comfort mark twos uh this case is about 25 larger so you have these guys a lot of puff on there but actually it's not as much puff as you think because if you press down here it's really hard right here so right here is um that's not all puff that that is a half puff um so you got this pull here protects the buttons the buttons are pretty nice you get your toggle looks like an app so you can go from on or sorry off to bluetooth i assume pull this yeah so they're bluetooth and they also give you um a wireless dongle adapter i believe but we shall see the microphone is kind of ingenious like you don't want to always have a dedicated mic but this will just come down like that and when you're not using the microphone you know it would be nice if it actually recessed properly in there because now it looks like oh your headphones are broken but um you compared to the other side what happened there oh nothing it's just my microphone interesting that these pop in and out probably for some added comfort pretty nice extend i like how it doesn't make that clicking sound when you extend headphones like okay i'll just try them on so really comfortable they fit really well and even without them being on good noise isolation cancellation we'll have to see the software level microphone level cancellation in a bit you have your aux port there bluetooth indicator usbc um not sure if that's a charger and uh i believe this to hear outside in when you turn on and off noise canceling or to sense what to cancel out so i'm going to try these out for the whole day on microsoft teams and i'm gonna report back so the few tests i did do was comparing bluetooth to your computer versus the usb dongle and i gotta say you have to use the usb dongle to take advantage of the the boom mic um for those that maybe miss this in the case it's kind of hidden like it's actually this thing is over it so if you're not looking for it you won't find it this is the usb um dongle so you're gonna get superior uh quality both on the microphone and on the um speak um the headphones on your computer obviously you can't do that on your phone you just bluetooth it and whatnot and um it does sound better when you um when you take down like it's got mics in it so you don't have to use the boom mic but it does sound better when you use the boom mic and just make sure that you turn it this way so it's in front of your mouth when you're talking the closer the better but compared to the ant lion mod mic wireless or mod mic 5 mod mic wireless and and um the wireless and the five are much better microphone quality and then for sound quality compared to the bose 35 um ii quiet comfort the sound on these is a slightly better but you're also spending about 150 dollars more the cool microsoft teams option here that will show red on the side of the headphones when you're in a a meeting or a call is nice however one issue with it is when you're in an office people don't really um you know oh he's got a red at the side of his head so i he i know he's in a call like i don't think that um social formality has been you know understood i don't think people would really pick up on that they just think like oh he's wearing some kind of wireless headset there's just a light glowing um but pretty cool that it's team certified got the team's logo um i would say for someone that doesn't have the mod mic wireless um um then you know it could be a good option to pick these up but for me i just need that superior voice quality when i'm taking um work personal and professional meetings and this is almost there i would say it's about 75 as good as mod wireless for the microphone a lot of people when they're buying headphones are just looking for good sound quality because listening to music and whatnot but if you take meetings all day with the clients and co-workers you definitely want to sound the best so you want the best microphone so i would definitely rate mod mic um the highest and these probably number two so i hope you guys enjoyed this review and have a great day [Music] you
